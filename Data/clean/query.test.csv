Please do more (you do a lot already, thanks you!) to highlight to your viewers, most of whom are vegan, it seems, the harm being done (it seems) by the fat-laden vegan junk food, as well as dairy-fat junk food.I look at the Japanese eating their fish, and they don’t seem to have the heart disease issues we have, but I don’t think the culture over in Japan ingests large amounts of dairy fat cookies, cakes, etc. and vegetable-fat-laden cakes and cookies…potato chips, fried corn chips, and other high-vegetable-fat packaged (and baked) goods. USA seems to live on bags of chips and cookies as snack for kids, and many parents think “oh, it’s vegan, it’s OK.” I think getting this vegan message across to your viewers, and future viewers, is where you might provide the most benefit.If family doctors gave this information to new parents taking babies in for the first year of check-ups, think what a difference it might make. Parents might start feeding their babies and toddlers boiled potatoes and steamed broccoli instead of hot dogs and French fries.Thanks BB. I repeatedly clicked the up arrow but it only lets me vote once. Otherwise you’d be up to 100+ “likes”What do you think of the research-based differentiation that many nutrition doctors make about the two kinds of LDL? One particle is large and fluffy and passes through the arteries, and one is small and dense and gets stuck in there, forming plaque. This was on Sanjay Gupta and several other health shows. Also the recent large study that showed that saturated fat intake had no effect on health? It’s hard for me to decide what to do when highly respected doctors disagree among themselves. I don’t have the advanced medical training. Thanks, John S PDX ORJohn S: You are not the first person to ask these questions.B oth Toxins and MacSmiley gave such great answers to the first question that I saved their answers. I copied those answers below for you.Your second question about saturated fats has also been well answered by other people. If you still have that question after reading through the information and links below, let me know, and I will try to find those answers. ****************************************** MacSmiley Re Large and fluffy LDL being benign or even beneficial: ALL ApoB-containing particles (found in LDL of all sizes) are atherogenic.

Everyone, in fact, is a high-risk individual for this uniquely mass disease.”Again I would encourage you to view the first link I shared in my first post to you.I’ve been reading reviews of “The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet” by Nina Teicholz, which seems to refute much of the information found on nutritionfacts.org.Perhaps the book was sponsored in some way by the meat and dairy industries, but maybe not. I’d like to hear Dr. Greger’s and others response to the book.Hi Paul,Here are two very interesting in-depth reviews of the book:http://thescienceofnutrition.wordpress.com/http://carbsanity.blogspot.ca/2014/06/plagerizing-plagiarism-and-plagiarists.htmlThank you, Mike. Very interesting indeed. And helpful, too.The problem is multifactorial: too many carbs and sugars; too many vegetable fats and too high a ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 essential fatty acids; very poor quality meat having, again, too high a ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 essential fatty acids; no where nea enough exercise or overall body movement/activities…Unfortunately, trials and studies done on foods are inherently very unreliable. Studying one ingredient is useless because ingredients almost never have health impacts (positive or negative) in isolation to other ingredients. Studies on a particular food are also unreliable as there are too many variables involved (both in the food, as well as in the lives of the people taking part in the study).The more we increase our knowledge about isolated nutrients, the less we seem to know and understand about a particular food(s) as a whole and its impact on our health.Hi lason,Glad to see some additional sanity on this blog! Those stuck in vegan or pale or other isolated this-food-is-bad ideas just cannot see the big picture. Including Dr. Gregor and total paleo promoting physicians as well.Bad foods are processed foods and junk and isolated sugar etc. etc. etc. Real food is good food. Whether it contains cholesterol or saturated fat or not.But yes, modern raised poor quality meat has problems with skewing the essential fat ratios, antibiotics and more. Plus putting children on low fat, low cholesterol vegan diets is dangerous indeed.White bread, not enough veggies, processed foods, chemical contamination in foods and so much more is involved.These blogs, while sometimes providing useful information, just don’t cut the mustard in trying to put together the bigger picture of foods relationship to disease and health.Thanks again for your post! LindaThis is a well written summary of what the pizza, ice cream, and hot dog diet continues to do to our children. One of mine just had a 10th birthday and annual physical which, of revealed nothing about the state of her arteries.Is any effort underway to have cholesterol checks performed as part of a child’s annual physical ? At least we’d have some idea of the damage that has potentially already been done.I assume the pediatricians will do it ?","['abdominal fat', 'adolescence', 'aging', 'aneurism', 'animal fat', 'aortic aneurysm', 'blood pressure', 'body fat', 'brain disease', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cardiovascular health', 'children', 'cholesterol', 'Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn', 'Dr. Dean Ornish', 'fat', 'flexitarians', 'gangrene', 'HDL cholesterol', 'heart disease', 'heart health', 'hypertension', 'infants', 'LDL cholesterol', 'lifespan', 'longevity', 'low-fat diets', ""men's health"", 'mortality', 'obesity', 'plant-based diets', 'saturated fat', 'smoking', 'stroke', 'tobacco', 'vegans', 'vegetarians', ""women's health""]",-,-,-,-,"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/paleolithic-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/GMO/","http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3455748,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3534337,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17015535,"

It’s amazing what the food industry is able to get away with. There’s even sometimes Artificial Coloring in Fish. http://0rz.tw/YAAeLWhile scanning the grocery carts of young moms, I will often see colorful boxes and cans of cereal, mac & cheese, spagettio’s, etc and not much real food or produce. It is scary. For all the information out there about nutrition, I sometimes feel we are making no progress at encouraging healthy diets. The youngest kids who need the best nutrition seem to be fed the most processed junk….SAD!Yes SAD SAD SADI was born on a farm almost 90 years ago. My mother and grandmother preserved almost everything the farm produced in glass Mason jars. After I moved to NYC and started shopping for canned fruits and vegetables out of season, their colors were sometimes a surprise. One of my childhood favorites was spiced crabapples. Although the raw fruit was blessed with rosy cheeks the spiced one was almost a caramel color. The jar I bought was a bright red! This was so foreign to the fruit I knew as a child, I couldn’t eat it and would never buy it again. One instance when the store variety was not enhanced with artificial color!The dyes & artificial flavorings will never be removed because these are deliberate acts designed to control the population through food. Have you ever heard of “Codex Alimentarus” ? Go to YouTube & search Dr. Rema Labow (sp?) she explains all of this very clearly. It’s the same deal with adding fluoride to the public water supply, GMO foods created by Monsanto, removing Iodine from the food supply (which plays a vital role in normal growth & development especially with hormones & has given rise to the pseudo “need” for toxic drugs like Cialis & Viagra). Without keeping the masses sick in one way or another Big Pharma & the insurance companies go broke !

Autophagy is known to increase the immunity, too, because the process can capture and kill bacteria inside cells and recycle the nutrients in them.I limit eating to about 12 hours. Wondering if that’s long enough to have a positive effect.I don’t think it is. I think it takes about 14+h on average for mTOR to bottom out on a fast/feed cycle.Thanks!Hi Adam – do you have a reference you could cite for that information? ThanksI’m practicing this “intermittent fasting” approach at the moment, but would love to see what Dr. Gregor comes up with in terms of solid research out there… Great information. Love all the videos! Thank you!Yes, thanks Doc for this; mTOR signaling seems to spur cancer cell proliferation. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775843/Excess amino acids, glucose and insulin and oxidative stress activate mTOR signaling; many plants have phytonutrients that inhibit it. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3039966/Leucine, an amino acid predominant in dairy, helps explain why milk sets off the wacky cell signaling system that leads to prostate cancer, says German dermatologist Dr. Bodo Melnik. Lots of links to his research here: http://eatandbeatcancer.com/2014/07/23/anti-cancer-diets-whats-the-deal-with-dairy/“…just a few centuries ago, average life expectancy in London was less than 16 years old.”I suspect that this average includes infant and childhood mortality. Whenever I look at the age when adults of a few centuries, or even quite a few centuries, ago died, the numbers are not that different from our times: 50s-70s or even later.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672390/The crude average figures often used to depict the brevity of Victorian lives mislead because they include infant mortality, which was tragically high. If we strip out peri-natal mortality, however, and look at the life expectancy of those who survived the first five years, a very different picture emerges. Victorian contemporary sources reveal that life expectancy for adults in the mid-Victorian period was almost exactly what it is today. At 65, men could expect another ten years of life; and women another eight [24,32,33] (the lower figure for women reflects the high danger of death in childbirth, mainly from causes unrelated to malnutrition). This compares surprisingly favourably with today’s figures: life expectancy at birth (reflecting our improved standards of neo-natal care) averages 75.9 years (men) and 81.3 years (women); though recent work has suggested that for working class men and women this is lower, at around 72 for men and 76 for women [34].If we accept the working class figures, which are probably more directly comparable with the Victorian data, women have gained three years of life expectancy since the mid-Victorian period while men have actually fallen back by 3 years. The decline in male life expectancy implicates several causal factors; including the introduction of industrialised cigarette production in 1883, a sustained fall in the relative cost of alcohol and a severe decline in nutritional standards, as outlined below. The improvement in female life expectancy can be partly linked to family planning developments but also to other factors promoting women’s health such as improvements in dress. Until widespread accessible family planning facilities arrived after the First World War, women’s health could be substantially undermined by up to 30 years of successive pregnancies and births [35–37]. These figures suggest that if twentieth century women had not also experienced the negative impacts of tobacco consumption becoming respectable, along with an increased alcohol intake and worsening nutrition as they began to consume the imported delicacies originally preserved mainly for the men (all those things which had cost their menfolk three years), they would have gained six years.Thanks Charles. That article is a fascinating read. I seem to recall your name from a few years ago as a passionate advocate for the Dark Side of the Force! Or am I mistaken?you are mistakenOK. My apologies. There was a Charles Glashow who used to be an active commenter on eg Don Matesz’s blog and appeared to advocate high meat diets….http://donmatesz.blogspot.com/2012/09/grass-fed-animal-products-prevent.htmlNow I know what you mean – yes that was me – I’ve moderated my views on diet but I still consume animal productsDear Dr GregorI love your site and have learnt so much but please I wish you wouldn’t use random facts that only tangentially relate to the point you make- “…just a few centuries ago, average life expectancy in London was less than 16 years old.” It detracts from your argument and makes you look a bit desperate. Evolution like this doesn’t work over a few centuries and of course the reason the figure is so low is because of death in childbirth which is the opposite of the point you are making.Nevertheless I forgive you. Keep up the great work..I can ask for a reference to this comment if you’d like? Thanks for the kind words.Someone emailed us a reference if you are interested. “Just three centuries ago, life expectancy was less than 16 years and 75% of people born in London in 1662 died before they reached the age of 26″ I hope this helps clarify things.Dr. André Gernez works on cancer prevention propose a cancer prevention protocol validated on rodents with induced early-stage liver cancer: Group 1: Caloric reduction (~50% survival) Group 2: Caloric reduction + vitamin/minerals (~75% survival) Group 3: Caloric reduction + multivitamin + chemoprevention (~92% survival) => Result [1)] suggests autophagy is associated with cancer cell death when the cancer is in its early stage.Human equivalent is 30 days long and has been practiced in France since the 1970s.The books from the same author are in French, it’s really too bad. They are must reads for anyone interested in pioneering works. He integrated the stems cells into a theory of carcinogenesis (1968). Sadly “stem cells” and their relevance in cancer is mainstream medical knowledge today without his due acknowledgement.small request : replace term “traditional medicine” with orthodox or western medicine. TCM or First Nation herbalism would count as traditional in my book.Noted! Thanks, ToBeAlive :)How is this a new compound? The study you link to in the very sentence in which you call it “new” is from 1975… And even a cursory look into the research shows that it is associated with both a decrease but also an increase in different forms of cancer risk.It is, anyway, unclear what the point of this piece is—it’s hardly possible or medically advisable for your readers to start speculatively taking rapamycin in an attempt to lengthen their lifespans. What was the intention here?I also practice daily “IF.” It’s 1:45 and I just finished lunch consisting of carrots, celery and apple slices dipped in hummus topped off with a sweet potato. Throughout the morning I consumed two cups of coffee and four cups of a variety of teas: a green/white blend, a green/hibiscus/lemongrass blend, and Celestial Seasonings Indian spice which is black tea with cinnamon, cloves, and other great stuff. I have an office in the hospital where I can come and go seeing patients at my own pace. I challenge myself to see as many as possible before I have any food. I have conditioned myself to not even THINK about eating till at least noon. It is really amazingly simple. As far as the comment below re: a 12 hour feeding window, I doubt that would qualify for IF or achieve the effects of calorie restriction. That is essentially eating from 10 AM to 10 PM. Not much “hormesis” occurring there.Actually I also drank a cup of green tea with amla and erythritol, after which I ate the leaves.Metformin also inhibits mTOR. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=metformin+and+m+torAnd maybe also resveratrol. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24060150This citation is particularly interesting, especially toward the end: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21851178In the subject autophagy and cancer, there’s an interesting work done by Dr. Michael Lisanti, an american researcher in cancer treatment now working in Manchester, UK. Without going into details that can be seen HERE, he says both autophagy inducers and autophagy inhibitors can kill cancer cells: he calls this the autophagy paradox. To solve this paradox, he suggests the best strategy is to give alternating autophagy inducers and autophagy inhibitors to cancer patients – this will “confuse” the cancer, and the tumor will die. So, translating this to a day to day living, it’s probably a good idea alternate caloric restriction with non-caloric restriction…?Disagree. At 80 I’m doing far better than any of my ancestors. Feel fine, exercise, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, peas, nuts, B12 ….Fitness exercise most days. My wife slightly younger just did a 5K first in her age group. At Fitness there are people in their 80’s and 90’s doing just fine. No pharmaceuticals.Now I have a couple health situations which cause me no problem. I’ve had squamous cell carcinoma’s removed heal fine. Doubtless sunburns decades ago. I have atrial flutter dating from a bad cold in 2004, where my atrium beats at 270 but my ventricle beats at 70. This is not Afib. I get a cardiologist checkup yearly. No treatment advised, no aspirin even. Feel fine, bicycle up steep hills (this is NH) not out of breath no heart stress.There are people around here who look much older than I am but were born later. That’s their choice. The doctors that prescribe whatever the fashionable and expensive pharmaceuticals need to heed: http://nutritionstudies.org/major-medical-center-offers-plant-based-programs/. A couple relatives in the medical industry may be headed in that direction very slowly since nutrition isn’t taught in medical school and research in the U.S. is funded by pharmaceuticals thanks to Republicans cuts to NIH. NIH did fund a rat longevity study for T.Colin Campbelll in “The China Study” (funded by Premier Chou Enlai who had cancer). Essentially rats on 20% protein died or were very sick at usual life span while rats on 5% protein were in great shape.Jerry I was just talking to someone about this very thing. At 5 and 10 k races one sees the fittest individuals during the award ceremony–in all age groups. Truly inspiring. 80 years olds are getting around as well as the younger racers.We’ll never get mainstream nutritionists to acknowledge these facts about longevity until their monetary connection with food multinationals is severed.

This reminds me of that. Impressive! Please keep up the good work!Do the reported antibiotic properties of lemon kill any of the good bacteria inside of us? What is the longterm effect of lemon-juice ingestion and our beneficial microbiome? I ask this because I use two whole lemons everyday, and am wondering what beneficial bacteria that has maybe suppressed in my mouth, and all the way down and through my entire GI tract and body. I hear so much that lemons are a good antibiotic, but does the consistent use of citrus somehow compromise the POTENTIAL AND VIABILITY of our microbiome? This possibility is one of the reason that some people avoid honey, because of the thinking that it will eventually kill and or weaken the good bacteria as well. Any research studies you’ve come across show that lemon, limes, and other very sour citrus fruits won’t do this?Love citrus and citrus juices…but now that I’m over 60 I find them very irritating to the urinary tract. Dr. has told me not to drink oj, etc. How can I reduce the irritation to allow me to benefit from citrus?In what way are they irritating? Do you pee more or less when including citrus?“…two cups of orange juice, blood flow goes up. It works even better when they gave them the orange juice itself.”orange juice itself -> orange itself ?EDIT: As solo points out below, the preceding words that I elided supply crucial context.confused as well.No, it said “…the amount of hesperidin found in two cups of orange juice…”When I eat citrus (antioxidant) foods my body temperature goes down, and if I eat a lot I will feel cold and my hands may turn white.I think there may be an error in this sentence, it doesn’t make sense. “When researchers give people the amount of hesperidin found in two cups of orange juice, blood flow goes up. It works even better when they gave them the orange juice itself…” Was is supposed to be when given “the orange itself”???He has it rightCitrus is in season during winter and melons, which are cooling, in summer.

They all died of cancer between ages 8-10. I suspect they would have lived longer if I had resisted their begging for human treats. My cats get only quality pet food and white albacore tuna as a rare treat.Thanks for your reply, Joan! Food must be very important to other animals too…and I think people food that’s healthy for humans is also healthy for our non-human animal family (with exceptions, of course!) You sound like a very loving companion to your boxers and cats!!!Your online name says it all…must be a pet heaven around your place!For sure, Joan…I totally love animals!!! (Human and Non-Human both! :)White albacore tuna would not be my first choice for a pet treat. Tuna is known for having higher than average amounts of mercury. According to the Environmental Defense Fund, albacore tuna has mercury levels almost three times higher than the smaller skipjack, used in most canned light tuna.Thank you…they get only a small amount occasionally.They may only get a small amount, but cats are very small animals.My dog, who died of bone cancer, ate certified organic carrots, broccoli, potatoes, berries, apples and other vegetables and fruits. And, for a couple years, I made all my own pet food from organic grains, some organic meats, and lots of organic veggies. It was very expensive, but she loved it. The veterinarian was aghast that I was not purchasing “balanced” commercial pet food. I was following recipes of holistic Vets. Other than her stools, the dog did very well health-wise.There is a really good pet food –Orijen that is said to containfruits and vegetables as well as local small farmed (meats and wild fish in Canada).http://www.chewy.com/cat/orijen-cat-kitten-grain-free-dry-cat/dp/29728Certain animals need to have meat and don’t do as well eating vegetarian, although more and more plant based proteins are being added to their diets.Could these hormones or chemicals possible interfere with things other than growing blood supply, such as the birth of new neurons or something like that. How do we know that by inhibiting one bad thing we don’t inhibit good things as well?maybe this could be helpful…https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9bDZ5-zPtYVery interesting, but did you even read what I asked?sorry, i forget about my message in this topic… well, your question is intriguing but not simple to answer because biochemistry is such a complex matter of science… e.g. the citokines family of TGF beta is so important in cell metabolism and got so many effects that one of my Cellular Pathology Professors told as a joke that if he would pose a question, any question about cell metabolism and me or one of my colleagues answers with “It’s TGF beta” he could not tell us that we’re wrong because that class of compounds is involved pratically in everything… from my point of view and clically speaking (focusing on human patient) we could test the “diet”, or “compounds” with a very very very good follow up of patients and searching for all biochemical markers of inflammation and organ damage… if the clinical picture point to a sustained improvement we could say that that therapy is more good than bad in a general way… but a molecular level you could only make suppositions… maybe inflammatory molecules are still present, but a level that do not bother cells… i expect in future to see more exams like these:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarrayIn particular i would be more interested in trascriptional data, but even DNA data are useful…I wonder if this would hold true to cutting off the blood supply to aspergilloma?Dr. Greger, would you please weigh in on the meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on saturated fat? Is it true that most of the studies that found that sat fat is not linked to heart disease were either dairy industry-funded or observational studies? Does the best science still support a diet with little-to-no sat fat for heart health? Many thanks!Hi Jessica: response to your question was previously asked and posted here: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/low-carb-diets-and-coronary-blood-flow/But I will re-post here for your convenience. The bottom line = errors in the research.1. Dr. David Katz: http://huff.to/1qX5ZTQ2. “Scientists Fix Errors in Controversial Paper About Saturated Fats”Willett says correcting the paper isn’t enough. “It is good that they fixed it for the record, but it has caused massive confusion and the public hasn’t heard about the correction.” The paper should be withdrawn, he argues.” “It’s dangerous.”http://bit.ly/1jxyIJv3. Lastly: Dr McDougall http://on.fb.me/1iOfvEZThank you!My dogs all died of cancer, with some cancers worse than others. Fraulein, a German Shorthair Pointer died at age 13 of a cancer that lined the cells of the blood vessels. It was all over her body. The holistic veterinarian I spoke with on the telephone said it was because I gave her liver, which made her coat glow –it was soft and naturally shiny, perhaps because of all the B vitamins. But, organ meats are amongst the most toxic on the planet. This was my introduction into becoming an environmentalist.Vandermint, our second German Shorthair Pointer died at age 10 of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Food was not the problem, but breathing moth balls under the bed where she loved to nap, was the culprit. The mothballs were enclosed in plastic bags with woolen clothing, and all was enclosed within heavy corrugated boxes. It was a lesson hard learned, and I never bought mothballs again and changed the way I stored woolen clothing.Becca, our third German Shorthair Pointer also died at age 10. Again, food was not the problem. My husband imported some “free” soil into her backyard. The give-away soil was contaminated with radionuclides from production waters of the oil and gas industry. Becca tasted some after receiving a clean bill of health from our veterinarian, and 3 months later was dead of bone cancer in her shoulder. I had urged my “geologist” husband not to get this free soil to fill the holes of tree roots left by hurricane Lili, but he ignored me. I had been appointed to a board on municipal and “non-hazardous” oilfield wastes and learned at the time, that oil field wastes including production waters were being mixed with top soil and given away to naïve consumers like my husband. I had also attended seminars on oil field waste and what it does to human and animal health at Tulane Environmental Law Clinic. There are lots of poisons in the environment, in our soil (even though our garden had been grown organically for decades), from drift from agricultural fields that are poisoning the air, soils, waters, and tapped waters, and are in the food that both people and our pets consume that will or is giving us all cancers. Even if pets only eat “pet” food — the first foods to contain genetically modified organisms that were herbicide resistant, they would still develop cancers. We are all being poisoned for corporate greed.The following is an excerpt from The International Journal of Cardiology, Oct.3, 2013. What is fascinating is the fact that DRUGS that inhibit VEGF do indeed exacerbate cardiovascular disease. The answer, according to the article, is to develop new drugs and novel drug delivery systems. I wonder if inhibiting VEGF through DIET would result in similar side effects. I have a sneaking suspicion the answer is no:“In conclusion, the current study strengthens the rising concern for potentially life-threatening systemic cardiovascular side effects of current anti-angiogenic therapies both in oncology and ophthalmology. A disruption of endothelial homeostasis with subsequently accelerated atherogenesis may be one of the mechanisms underlying these cardiovascular adverse effects.Given the increased cardiovascular risk of elderly patients – representing the typical target population receiving anti-angiogenic therapies – and the increasing number of patients treated, the cardiovascular safety profile of all current anti-angiogenic regimens should be precisely determined. The identification of biomarkers for cardiovascular side effects, as exemplified by Scappaticci and colleagues in their meta-analyses including a total of 1745 patients with metastatic colorectal-, breast or non-small cell lung cancer [16x[16]Scappaticci, F.A., Skillings, J.R., Holden, S.N. et al. Arterial thromboembolic events in patients with metastatic carcinoma treated with chemotherapy and bevacizumab. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2007; 99: 1232–1239CrossRef | PubMed | Scopus (480)See all References][16], may ease patient selection for therapy and close monitoring of those at increased cardiovascular risk. Further subgroup analyses of existing randomized controlled trials and reporting of careful cardiac assessment of patients at baseline in future trials will guide the respective cardiovascular prevention in future.

I find that my diet, when high in beans, grains, and nuts contains too much copper… RDA amounts well in excess of 200 percent. Is there an accumulation of this heavy metal, and could it contribute to alzheimers and maybe even poor zinc status? Do vegan sources of copper get flushed out of the body quicker than the copper contained in meat, shellfish, and other animal-based products?The ADA recommendation this links to is from 2006. My dentist says that this caveat has been removed from the latest ADA recommendations. Given that I have a dental checkup in less than a week and after three or four years of refusing X-rays I am being STRONGLY advised to get some as they’re “the only way to find dental decay between the teeth or beneath the gum line before it causes significant problems or tooth loss,” I am in a quandary. Is there nothing more recent you can point to than an 8-year old recommendation?Grains = tooth pain for me,…tooth degradation. citrus seems to not help either.I have no problem with non-citrus fruits.I have the same problem as Laloofah. Every time I go to the dentist, they push me to get x-rays. And I mean, they really push. It got to the point where I considered going elsewhere because they pressured me to do it, I suspect because they have these very expensive machines sitting there in the exam room and they only make their money back on them if they use them. In recent years I have been to several different dentists, and it’s the same thing with each of them, warning me of dire consequences that could possibly result if I don’t get the x-rays. I really dislike the pressure tactics. Well, for many years I did get x-rays and I’m now in my my 50s and not one x-rays has revealed anything out of the ordinary.Here’s a link to the guidelines; updated in 2012. http://www.ada.org/sections/professionalResources/pdfs/Dental_Radiographic_Examinations_2012.pdfI would like to adjust my earlier comment because I didn’t know the meaning of the word “partially edentulous.” When I looked it up just now, I realized it refers to someone who has lost some of their teeth.Assuming that most of those reading this will not be toothless, I want to point out another section of the 2012 ADA paper that refers to the frequency of recommended x-rays for patients WITH teeth:“Adult (Dentate, Partially Edentulous and Edentulous)In the absence of any clinical signs or symptoms suggesting abnormalities of growth and development in adults, no radiographic examinations are indicated for this purpose. Therefore, in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms, no radiographic examination is recommended. So Laloofah, I’d suggest you go the 2012 document, print it out and highlight the relevant sections to show your dentist. They’re probably counting on your not bothering to look at the recommendation yourself. Good luck!I had just located and finished reading that document myself and returned here to post it, so thank you, Kristin and Dawn! I remember finding it after my last exam and debate with my dentist, not long after Dr. Greger posted the video on this. I have no symptoms or problems – but it does seem I read something else that backed up the dentist’s argument and resulted in a stalemate. If I locate it, I’ll post it.I found the bit the dentist used to bolster her recommendation, in one of the charts in the document Kristin linked to. For an adult recall patient with no cavities or risk of cavities, and with all or most of their teeth (which would be me), the ADA recommends dental X-rays at 24-36 month intervals. My exam next Monday will mark the 36 month interval. I was confused last time I read this, since the recommendation in the chart contradicts the recommendation you quoted in your comment, Dawn, though both appear in the same document! I’ll print them both and take them with me, but I agree about the pressure that is brought to bear and the challenge it presents to patients trying to make the right decision. Frustrating!My parents refused to let me have these procedures done on a routine basis as a child but in adulthood, I started getting dental X-rays annually. They did pick up one asymptomatic cavity which was repaired. I now get them every 10-12 months. I am going to stop, having read this article. I have also had a number of panoramex films done to check for keratocyst, which runs in my family, and for wisdom teeth extraction. So, all the more reason to stop the annual X-rays. Thanks Dr Greger.Great article. Well over a year ago, a friend of mine sent me a brief referencing x-rays from the ADA. My bride and I now ask our Dentist to “justify” his request for x-rays. I often wonder about Paul Newman and Senator Kennedy if maybe their brain cancer – white teeth and all – had anything to do with dental x-rays. Don and WE CAN! :-))Hi, I have some questions not directly related to this topic.I recently began to cook using a cast iron skillet, and I saw on a video a person explaining how to proper use it. While he was explaining he mentioned that cast iron is good because it enhances your iron absortion by providing it to the food you are cooking. Also he said that a little rust may be actually good for you, when explaining how to re use an old unseasoned one. He didn’t said to eat the rust, but that it wouldn’t hurt you if you missed a spot. That last thing kind of creeped me a little bit.I saw some more videos, because I was actually just looking up how to mantaince mine, but I found that the fact, or rumor, about the iron from the skillet could be healthy, repeated by the people on the videos.I haven’t look that up, but I thought on checking your site for some info. I didn’t find a post about that yet. So I thought on asking.I choose to buy cast iron because health reasons and I know that other equipment that is not stainless steel and cast iron can leave a chemical trace in your food.So the questions:1- Do you know if this fact about the iron is true? 2- Is there any scientific evidence about it? 3- Is the rust harmful, harmless or healthy? 4- Do you recommend using cast iron skillets and pots?Hope this topic interests you, thanks for your time and sorry for my grammar, I don’t have much practice writing in english.My understanding from reading some of the literature is that you must cook acidic solutions such as tomato sauce or orange juice or lemon juice in cast iron cookware to get the benefit of the iron for preventing iron-deficiency anemia in veganism. There is one study suggesting this from Brazil and there may be more. I don’t know anything about the toxicity. Rust is simply iron oxide. Darryl would know whether that’s absorbable or not.Thanks a lot :)if you read Dr. Neal Barnard’s book Power Foods for the Brain, he advises against the use of cast iron skillets (unless they are enamel-line) as iron is among the metals found in the amyloid plaques of people with Alzheimer’s Disease. Excess quantities the body is unable to get rid of seems to accumulate in the brain.“There appears to be an association between exposure to bitewing radiographs and meningioma according to results of their study. However, the authors found no dose-response relationship, and found annual visits to the dentist to be protective. Of the radiographs studied, bitewings expose patients to the least amount of ionizing radiation, yet exposure to full mouth series (an effective dose about 5 times higher than that for bitewings)4 was not significantly associated with meningioma at any age or frequency. It also seems contradictory that control patients were significantly more likely to have visited a dentist than case patients. Finally, the magnitudes of the odds ratios are small, and their respective confidence intervals are borderline significant in many cases. It is important to be very careful when interpreting these numbers and their clinical relevance. One must be diligent when drawing conclusions from statistics, and especially cautious when reporting on a topic that can potentially alarm the general public.” http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.27812/fullWhile I applaud Dr. Greger’s efforts to help us understand these studies, he has developed a reputation for taking these individual studies out of context, similar to how the media tends to report them. I would hope that he and his readers remain attentive to how the results of individual studies should always be presented in the context of the overall evidence, for those results to be meaningful to the bigger picture. Otherwise, we are simply bouncing from one piece of “breaking health news” to the next, without coming to meaningful conclusions:“The impact of isolated foods in isolated feeding studies has little to no meaning to the impact of what such foods have as part of an overall lifestyle.For instance, think about the latest DVD by Dr Greger and the section on cancer. In the first study he showed that there was triple the rates of cancer for every 50 grams of poultry consumed. And then he said that for 1/4 of a chicken breast (50 grams), tripled the risk.However, in the next 3-4 studies, he showed how powerful a plant-based diet was in slowing the growth and even in killing cancer cells. Yet, the diet he showed including chicken at 100 grams up to 3x a week.So, did chicken triple the risk/rate or did chicken help to slow the growth and kill cancer cells?This is why everything has to be put into proper context and properly applied to the situation at hand.”from: http://www.drmcdougall.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=418940#p418940I hope you find the information at least as worthwhile as I have. Please have a wonderful day.Thanks for reminding me and giving me more hefty ammunition the next time the dentist ‘suggests’ xrays. It floors me the way doctors and dentists harass patients/customers with dire consequences when we go agains costly protocol.The article failed to mention the biggest factor in radiation level, which is digital vs traditional xrays.Could you clarify if both are bad or just the traditional xraysDr Greger–I found this more recent PDF from the ADA about patient selection guidelines for dental radiographs–I would recommend adding this resource to your page, particularly to replace and/or supplement your “official recommendations” link in the article text: http://www.ada.org/sections/professionalResources/pdfs/Dental_Radiographic_Examinations_2012.pdfI changed dentist because he refused to not ex ray me every 6 months. He obviously needed the money . Instead of arguing with him I found another dentist. The new dentist is very good except for the pro advocacy about fluoridation in the city drinking water which I and others are fighting against.I am staggered to read that so many dentists routinely x-ray their patients. This is not common practice in Belgium, and I doubt on most of the European continent. X-rays are used very sparingly overall.I usually only allow dental xrays every 2 years and that is only to shut my dentist up. I think I will widen that interval after reading this. they really are pushy about it. I don’t have a single cavity and I’m 47 years old, that’s a lot of years of unnecessary xrays. sad dentists are doing this to make a buck.Ahh this scares me. I’m 20 and I had to get two panoramics last year because they screwed the first one up and recently they pushed me to get 8 individual xrays on specific teeth. How long does it take for my brain cells to regenerate? or have i done permanent damage?Of course they want you to get x-rays every time you come in. It’s insurance money, right? Cha-ching. I know a guy who never goes to the dentist. He doesn’t have insurance. He doesn’t have much money. He doesn’t have a job. He doesn’t take the best care of his teeth either so they are slowly rotting out on him. But for a guy his age (51), who never goes to a dentist, he’s doing pretty well.My dentist goes almost ballistic if I mention the subject of X-rays. She has just about kicked me out of her office and behind her fake smile I perceive she is actually quite rude about how she handles this. I looked this up because yesterday I had my yearly dental exam and they took 4 X-rays. Of course it had been many years since I have been to the dentist, so I’m probably ahead of the game compared to most.I read a book called “Physics For Future Presidents” where they talked about radiation exposure, and it definitely said that below a certain threshold the studies just are getting noise and that low levels of radiation cannot be accurately measured. (these are my words) It was plausible, but I don’t know, and with all the other source of physical “insult” to our bodies these days, I’d prefer to minimize my exposure to X-rays (no pun intended).What can I do to make my dentist stop these X-rays, or how can I know for sure when an X-ray is really necessary?I expressed radiation concerns to my dentist and was told they use digital x-rays which “expose you to less radiation than being in the sun.” I was also told if I refuse to get x-rays I would be released as a patient and because that’s the only way they can tell what’s happening between the teeth. I asked if I could sign something saying I choose to have no x-rays if I have no symptoms of problems. They said no. What recourse do I have?Deb: It’s my understanding (though I’m not an authoritative voice on the topic) that medical professionals have a right to refuse service to anyone they want. So, I think your only short-term options are to give in or find a better dentist. It sucks, but you may look on this as an opportunity to find a much better dentist…Good luck.Thanks for replying. Yes it does suck. I’ve liked them except for this. Is it true that digital x-rays are better? I know nothing about that. It stinks when you aren’t allowed to be responsible for your own health care. I’ve fought battles like this with regard to other health issues!Deb: I have heard that digital x-rays use less radiation. If true, then to the degree that they use less radiation and still provide clear results (do not require re-takes as much), then yes, I think that digital x-rays would be better.My personal policy is: If I need the x-ray, then I will get it regardless of what kind is available right then. If I do not need the x-ray, then I will not get it, regardless of what kind is available.But that’s easy for me to say right now. I’m not facing the need to find another dentist right now.My dentist has been pretty cool. While I haven’t refused bit-wings, I did refuse the full-mouth panarama one. Both the dentist and hygenist put on a little pressure, but they ultimately respected my wishes and did not resort to threats. I respect them a lot for that given stories like the one you are telling.Good luck.Digital x-rays are 50-75% LESS radiation than for film (depends on the brand/age of the sensors). And if your dentist doesn’t have digital, then you SHOULD be going somewhere else, since if they haven’t gone digital then you don’t know what else they are behind the times on….I recently had a full-mouth x-ray (for no good reason) and they said I might have to have my 2 top wisdom teeth pulled (I’m 16). Should I continue and go to an oral specialist? Or is it not worth it? I really don’t want to undergo surgery for their removal, but I also don’t want oral pain for the rest of my life. The teeth aren’t in yet, but they “might” cause problems, as they don’t have much room to move in.I have been suspecting that Dental X-rays is a cause of eye and brain disease for a long time. I recently decided to research into it. So far I found evidence that X-ray can cause cataract and that Dental X-rays can cause meningioma and is the main source of ionic radiation for most people. Have you got any suggestions what you can do yourself for protection? There should be something to protect the eyes and the brain. And there are companies selling such things but I have never seen them in a clinic (here in Sweden). It appears like it is up to the patient to protect themselves. There are lead glasses but will they help? Any other suggestions?","['American Dental Association', 'brain tumour', 'cancer', 'dental X-rays', 'dentists', 'doctors', 'iatrogenic harm', 'intracranial meningioma', 'meningioma', 'oral health', 'radiation', 'X-rays']",-,-,-,-,"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/paleolithic-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/GMO/","http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-dental-x-rays-cause-brain-tumors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16946440,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22492363,"

Does that apply to yogurt as well? I have read many times that the best probiotic is yogurt. Your thoughts?N. AllenYogurt only carries one or two probiotics and they have been mostly killed so they don’t reproduce and blow the lid off the container. Probiotics grow fast in the presence of sugar including the sugar in milk.Norman123: Yo might consider checking out “water kefir” and maybe rejuvalac. Both can be made a home and are supposed to provide a great deal of helpful probiotics. And neither come with all the harmful effects one gets from consuming dairy.(For more on the harm caused by dairy: http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/ )Something to think about.It seems like earlier Dr. Greger was saying to just eat fruits and vegetables because they have some lactic acid, but doesn’t the amount of lactic acids and probiotics multiply when you make sauerkraut? Some people are saying probiotics are expensive. Making sauerkraut is very easy and incredibly cheap! Want to get your veggies in? Make sauerkraut. Does having different species in the sauerkraut give you a broader portfolio of probiotics? I often put in daikon radish, onion, carrot, cabbage, red cabbage (antioxidants), napa cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, kale, etc. It makes a wonderful dressing for my nightly salad. John S PDX ORI disagree with Dr. Greger and the conventional wisdom (the majority of probiotic supplement makers) that it’s better to make an effort to increase the survival of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria through the highly acidic human stomach.People who agree with this strategy should either (1)swallow enteric-coated probiotic capsules, which will not melt open until after they have moved beyond the human stomach or (2)swallow their nonenteric-coated probiotic capsules during large meals, when the contents of the human stomach will be less acidic (have a higher pH).My belief is that it’s better to chew all probiotic capsules in our mouth. The reasons are: (1)Lactobacillus rhamnosus has been shown to easily survive inside the human stomach and to colonize it. People who have Lactobacillus rhamnosus thriving on the inner lining of their stomach will have a very dramatically lower risk of developing gastric cancer and other stomach diseases, according to scientific studies. (2)When probiotic bacteria colonize our mouth, we will very dramatically lower our risk of developing gum disease, bleeding gums, tartar (calculus), and dental cavities in addition to having a constant breeding ground of probiotic bacteria to supply our lower digestive tract: http://www.prohealth.com/library/showArticle.cfm?libid=13030&site=research http://www.cpmedical.net/articles/lactobacillus-gg-supports-gastric-healthMost people in the USA do not have an adequate supply of probiotics in their intestines, mostly due to the chlorine in the water, stress, and antibiotics in the meat they eat. It would be wise to take probiotics supplements (100 billion/day), or consume sauerkraut if you can stand the taste (yuck), or drink Kefir Water, not the store bought, but home made contains 40-50 strains of probiotics at around 500 billion in a 1/4 cup.Eating at Cafe Gratitude in Venice. They have a 1 trillion CFU packet. The Super Bowl of good bugs. Bottoms upI was wondering if the PREbiotic condition of the vegan “gut” or digestive track isn’t more productive than the PRObiotic effects of eating yogurt or taking pills? It would seem that it might be easier for nutrients (esp. vitamins in food) to be assimilated by the body, thereby having a greater effect on inflammation and chronic diseases. What does everyone think?If taking Ceylon cinnamon AND taking probiotic almond-milk yoghurt in the diet, how far apart should they be taken given that cinnamon has antibiotic properties?","['apple juice', 'dosage', 'fat', 'health food stores', 'milk', 'natural food stores', 'oatmeal', 'pharmacists', 'prebiotics', 'probiotics', 'supplements', 'vitamin D', 'water']",-,-,-,-,"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/paleolithic-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/GMO/","http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-and-treating-diarrhea-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-the-common-cold-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-probiotics-be-taken-before-during-or-after-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-feelings-probiotics-and-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/take-vitamin-d-supplements-with-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22146689,"

It seems to implicate not only mouthwash, but also alcohol-based herbal tinctures–even those that purport to combat cancer or improve immunity. Do you have any observations about the “cost-benefit analysis” of such tinctures that may offer beneficial, alcohol-soluable compounds, but do so in a medium that is potentially cancer-inducing? Does this study suggest that we should avoid putting any alcohol in our mouths? Many thanks.wait a minute! I thought we all understood that the only reason alcohol showed anything positive for heart disease was due to the resveratrol?? And of course, what came next was the fact that there are many other plant foods which offer us even higher levels of resveratrol (above that found in red wine), therefore, there is no reason to listen to the wine industry’s selective studies on benefits of wine?? I sure get tired of this endless discussion which never mentions the tired myths, especially when: 1.) right now, in America, we have the highest uptick in alcohol abuse that has occurred in a century; 2.) the drinking habit which progresses into end-stage alcoholism during late life (alcoholism is a progressive illness – the definition of disease is that it progresses!) is manifesting at a phenomenal rate among the oldest Boomers – those who are about 60-70, who of course have other precipitating factors destroying their livers already inc past drug abuse history, Agent Orange exposure, and multiple prescribed maintenance and interventional pharmaceuticals which we are now finding destroy our heart, brain, immune systems, livers, kidneys, etc. Being a 67 year old former substance abuse counselor currently surrounded by relatives and friends who are dying of their daily medicine drink + pills, I cannot wait for the Rest of The Story to catch up with us all.Actually, moderate alcohol appears to have positive effects in heart disease quite independent from resveratrol (which is absorbed in near negligible quantities). Here’s a curent review of epidemiological evidence and proposed mechanisms:Krenz, Maike, and Ronald J. Korthuis. “Moderate ethanol ingestion and cardiovascular protection: From epidemiologic associations to cellular mechanisms.” Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology 52.1 (2012): 93-104.Some effect of moderate alcohol include: • increased HDL cholesterol • decreased fibrinogen (a blood clotting factor) • reduced oxidative stress • improved insulin sensitivity • lowered blood pressure • vasodilation via increased eNOS expression • increased tolerance to ischemia/reperfusionThe most interesting cellular mechanism for me is induction of ALDH2, which both clears acetaldehyde, the initial metabolite of alcohol, and also other reactive carbonyls resulting from oxidative stress, including lipid peroxidation and early glycation products. This mechanistic work is important, as it offers potential for obtaining the vascular and (overall) cancer preventative effects associated with moderate alcohol use without the associated acetaldehyde damage (especially at higher intakes) and sociobehavioral consequences. So far, there are only a couple of novel compounds that appear to activate ALDH2 directly, but a least one dietary compound does indirectly. If it does so via Nrf2, then that both clarifies how Nrf2 activation prevents ischemia/reperfusion injury and offers a mechanism of mimicking the effect of alcohol throug the many known dietary Nrf2 activators.In these studies, teatotallers (alcohol abstainers) are invariably the referent group. But they are a pretty odd group, going against social norms, and represent, what?, 10-15% of the general population? They represent a collection of different groups – some for religious reasons (e.g. Muslims), some for health reasons (e.g. people on extremely healthy diets), some for other personal reasons (e.g. a remote history of alcoholism, successfully treated by abstention). Thus these people are probably quite different than those who consume up to 1 glass of alcohol per day.What is weird about this hypothesis of mine is that confounding does not adequately explain why there is a J curve for cardiovascular disease but no J curve, actually a linear relationship, with breast cancer. You would expect the confounding to go in the same general direction, even though CVD and breast cancer are two different entities. They tend to share common antecedents like obesity, smoking, sedentarism and dysglycemia.Hence while we will never get a randomized trial to sort this issue out, we can look to observational studies and the dichotomy they present between CVD outcomes on the one hand, and cancer outcomes on the other. This actually suggests specificity for cancer, thereby fulfilling one of Bradford-Hill’s strongest criteria for causality. Very interesting, indeed! Thanks Dr G!There is a J-curve for alcohol and all-cancer mortality. Low-dose alcohol appears to induce antioxidant response element and heat shock response proteins (so like cruciferous vegetables, alcohol may be a hormetin). But breast cancer is different – aside from breast being one of few tissues that in health cyclically proliferates, and is hence epigenetically primed for cancer initiation, I’m not sure why the dose response to alcohol differs from other tissues.Good kibbitzing with you; your knowledge base is phenomenal.I wasn’t aware that low amounts of alcohol was actually chemopreventive in terms of cancer health for most non-breast cancer tissues. It is unusual for a substance, perhaps even one as complex as an alcoholic beverage, to have a bimodal effect on malignancy such that it retards cancer in one organ system/tissue type but promotes it in another. More likely either the breast cancer studies are wrong or the meta-analysis is wrong and the findings in nature are probably more aligned. Then again, cigarette smoking only affects certain body tissues and does not uniformly cause cancer in every tissue bed exposed to its carcinogenic constituents – unlike, say, ionizing radiation or many types of chemotherapy.Genetic variations in alcohol metabolism probably confound attempts to establish risk curves. There was an interesting study that compared alcohol dehydrogenase genotypes with alcohol induced breast cancer risk. Those who metabolized alcohol to acetaldehyde quickly were at much higher risk. I haven’t found similar studies on aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (which clears acetaldehyde) and breast cancer, but heavy drinkers with less active ALDH2 are at much higher risk of stomach cancer. If the acetaldehyde, which forms DNA adducts, is the main carcinogenic agent, then those expressing fast ADH/slow ALDH2 would be a much higher risk from a given alcohol intake than those with slow ADH/fast ALDH2 genotypes.Incidentally, more active forms of ALDH2 (which reduce the severity of hangovers and flushing) are strongly associated with alcoholism. Still, the morning-after may be a useful gauge of how much genetic damage one is doing.Fascinating! But your previous link is not directing to a known website and I would love to read it — viz. “This meta-analysis found a J-curve for alcohol and all-cancer mortality.”Fixed. Figure 4 was the interesting bit: http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/10/25/annonc.mds508/F4.medium.gifDarryl, I had a few more questions about aspirin dosing for chemoprevention. 1) Would it work with ultra-low dosing – i.e. half of an 81 mg enteric coated tablet per day (I believe there is one trial – Dutch TIA – which compared 30 mg with 300 mg and found a non-significant but large (if it had been better powered) risk reduction with the higher dose; this is in Rothwell’s meta-analysis); 2) would a diet rich in fruits and vegetables be sufficient for chemoprevention – i.e. it is likely that ASA’s benefit in all those trials was on top of a very poor diet, since most of the patients had already demonstrated a tendency to fall into vascular disease.If I had to do it, I would consider taking half an enteric coated ASA 81 mg tablet.I don’t consider myself an egotistical person. But in this case I’m allowing myself an increase in my smugness coefficient since I’ve always been deeply suspicious of the effects of alcohol consumption. Maybe watching my grandfather die of liver cirrhosis – essentially starving to death – had something to do with it. Beyond that, considering alcohol not a food but either a chemical or drug also helps. Then realizing it is one of two consumables of zero nutrient density: alcohol and sugar really helps. Confusion factors like resveratrol and heart disease protection never dissuaded me. To me, the record is clear: there is no benefit to consuming alcohol and considerable risk.The article states, “The bacteria in our mouths appear to oxidize alcohol into this acetaldehyde carcinogen, which we then swallow”.So if you use (non-alcoholic) antiseptic mouthwash before consuming an alcoholic beverage, will the amount of carcinogen produced and therefore swallowed be significantly reduced?Question: Have there been studies on moderate to heavy alcohol consumption among very healthy people? Just curious if healthy eating (plant based) and moderate exercise would lesson or counteract the negative effects.

Anyway, you only see it in certain lighting and it came about when I was an omnivore. But even after 10 years of being a vegan with the diet described on this website which is healthiest, its still the same.Hi Ann are you on a low fat vegan diet? 10% or less of your diet?I used to be but that diet made me sicker and sicker, it also fucked up my blood. My total protein became too high and my glucose too low. I normally never had any problems like that. So I lowered fruit intake, upped healthy fat intake to about 15-20%, more vegetables and cooked food, and I cured all my complaints, even my eczema.If you are referring to the 80/10/10 diet I am very curious how your total protein became too high and your glucose too low, when the diet is a low protein and high carb diet. If anything it should have lowered your protein levels and increased your glucose levels. Strange? Any how I am glad you are OK and I wonder if your higher fat intake is what stops you from being able to get rid of the cellulite.Yes 80/10/10 specifically the fruitarian one. I am also curious how that could happen :S. Never in my life had I experienced that, and after I stopped the fruit diet my blood returned to normal. It happened both the times I went to take a bloodtest while on fruitarian diet.I know someone who eats quite some fat and has 0 cellulite so I don’t think it has anything to do with the fat, maybe more of a hormonal thing. It however doesnt botter me since its not really visible anyway, just in certain shades. But I dont mind.I wonder if your case has anything to do with the hormone adiponectin referred to in this post?Speaking of hormones, I have had elevated androgen levels since being about 15 and also my testosterone is quite high. It remains high no matter what I do with my diet, even on the fruitarian diet. I was tested for PCOS and I don’t have it.The fruitarian diet is not the healthiest approach. Dr. McDougall’s starch based diet is highly satiating and is base on sound science. It is also very low fat.I eat a higher carb diet, with lots of starch but I do eat abit higher fat which I seem to do better with. I think everyone has to experiment and find out for themselves.Very good advice! I tried it already and it works!I have been a vegetarian for 35 years and I have plenty of cellulite. While I love promoting plant-based diets for many important reasons, I don’t think reducing cellulite will be one of them.Hi Denise are you on a low fat vegan diet? 10% or less of your diet?Denise I have to say that I agree with you their. I’ve been plant-based now for 6 years and my cellulite is no different than when I started! Boy I wish it was that easy to get rid of it! lolLosing fat… common goal for many of my patients and most of the physicians I know. If you have been following NutritionFacts.org you know there are many factors and of course the media and diet industry adds new found layers of confusion on a regular basis. I have found two resources to be valuable for long term success. First, Jeff Novick’s DVD, Calorie Density: Eat More, Weigh Less and Live longer. Can be ordered off his website. The second is Doug Lisle’s presentation, How to Lose Weight without losing your mind.. which can be ordered off John McDougall’s website or one version is available for free on YouTube. It is a journey and by keeping calorie density low enough given relative activity and exercise you can achieve your goals.Yes I agree. I have started to be much more careful. If I eat out and have a large meal, next day I eat much less. I also take the stairs wherever I go and park in the furthest possible parking space to walk to a store. Every single calorie counts. If I exercise, I do not use it as an excuse to load more calories – that would be overcompensation and defeat one of the purposes of exercise. We tend to store fat in certain areas of the body, which differs greatly between individuals, but the calorie in calorie out model works very well. Also, avoiding very caloric foods helps too.I’m sure this article was fascinating but I couldn’t get past the third paragraph without vomiting. Shame.It would be great to do a video or article on spider/varicose vein treatment/prevention through diet and lifestyle, since most women and some men have them later in life and they can also be considered a lifestyle disease. I would say it is an even more ”important” (and visible) esthetic problem than cellulite, because it is more visible and can be associated with other vascular disease.It would be great to do a video or article on spider/varicose vein treatment/prevention through diet and lifestyle, since most women and some men have them later in life and they can also be considered a lifestyle disease.

Thanks for letting it go.Please consider doing a post or video on the harmful aspects of senna. It seems a lot of people use this stuff (according to the herbalists and health food store supplement employees.) I’ve been told by herbalists that people should not take sennna (then why is it on your retail shelf?) and GI doctors have said to avoid this herb. Apparently there is some bad data on it out there.Ripe kiwis.Having seen many patients over the years who have become reliant on stimulant cathartics like Senna it is nice to see that some research that shows a more natural approach to avoiding this common problem. Our understanding of the science of the GI tract is also getting better so you need to stay tuned as the science just keeps coming. With the exception of certain rare conditions patients should be able to avoid needing to take medications or over the counter supplements.Dates help too. The problem is that the sorbitol in prunes and apricots can be really painful for sensitive individuals…. The cramps and bloat are beyond painful. What would a person do whom is fodmaps sensitive, yet very constipated, as well as dealing with severe dysbiosis of yeast/fungus/mold/bacteria?Lastly, thoughts on coffee enemas?The trouble with these complex systems is that there is usually not a single correct answer and identifying the “upstream” cause is often difficult. I favor a starch centered approach as advocated by Dr. McDougall. This eliminates alot of the issues with FODMAPS such as sorbitol, galatose and fructose. Starches are just long chain glucose molecules. For complex issues not responsive to fairly straightforward changing of diet to whole plant based starch centered I recommend the “Diet for the Desperate” see McDougall newsletter in Dec 2002. In my experience what works varies from individual to individual and you need to adopt a plan that works for you. In my experience alot of the issues associated with “dysbiosis” resolve as well. Additionally, more recently I have been persuaded by Jeff Smith and his references to recommend non GMO foods… see website, Institute for Responsible Technology. I have no experience with coffee enema’s I would tend to avoid. It is important to work with your physician or other health care professional.I think prunes are great for constipation, but the gas can be annoying. What about acrylamide in prunes? Because I wasn’t sure about the safety of that, I’ve been using dried apricots. They are more expensive but seem to work ok and with less gas.Constipation is also business. First the industry removes the fiber so you get a piece of white bread. The lack of fiber makes you constipated, and then the industry will sell you the fiber, that was in the grains to begin with. I would suggest to skip the constipation, and eat the whole grain from the beginning.Has anyone ever looked into the position we take while evacuating our bowels? Most of the world squats while people using toilets sit; how natural is that? Obviously diet and water intake are the big factors, but I suspect this might also play a role.I find that 3-5 cups of warm water is better than any Laxatives out there.I have found as a vegan who had the ol’ gas problem that Dr. Weil’s suggestion of Triphala to work quite well – both for the gas and regularity! I get the 2,000 mg tabs from vitacost.com at a very reasonable price. If you go there and order ‘em, I would appreciate a reference, as I get some sort of recognition. Thanks Ted “Teddy” Rodosovich teddyrodo@hotmail.comTriphala is advised against http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-and-triphala-tested-for-metals/I am surprised no one is recommending good old fashion greens. Drop a handful of kale, one whole lime, and ice water in the Vitamix first thing in the morning. Hey it works for me.Best remedy for constipation is a plant based diet of healthy dark leafy greens and beans, or other plants from the garden rather than processed foods from a box.Also drinking a good supply of cleaner, purified water using a carbon filter and if necessary reverse osmosis. My minerals come from plants rather than from the water supply.","['bowel movements', 'bowel regularity', 'Bristol Stool Scale', 'California Prune Board', 'constipation', 'dried plums', 'finer supplements', 'home remedies', 'International Prune Association', 'laxatives', 'Metamucil', 'natural remedies', 'over-the-counter drugs', 'plant-based diet', 'plums', 'prunes', 'U.S. Food and Drug Administration', 'vegan', 'vegetarian']",-,-,-,-,"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/paleolithic-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/GMO/","http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bristol-stool-scale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-vs-metamucil-vs-vegan-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/",-

George Mateljan of WH Foods, gives fish (salmon, sardines etc) with high Omega 3 content the thumbs up. I drank coffee creamer for years. And plenty of pasteurized milk all my life.Due to high cholesterol and very high triglycerides (from pork fat no doubt) I have been on a meatless diet for four months, with plenty of fruits, vegies, seeds (ground fresh flax, pumpkin and sunflower) nuts, fish, eggs, yogurt and first cold pressed extra virgin olive oil, with occasional broiled chicken; and I have not felt so well in years.After six weeks my global cholesterol dropped from 9 to 5.5 (South African) and soon I am going for a thorough pathological investigation, for a full report.My parents ate home-laid eggs, meat and plenty of home-grown vegies all their lives, and lived into their nineties – my Dad to 93, and my Mom to 99; and they ate home free range chickens raised by my Dad. Meat they bought from butcheries.So what about fish and free-range eggs? Must I give them up too? I seldom ate processed meats anyway. I am now 76 and have always eaten fatty butchery meat in the past.Your parents had longevity genes. And if they were healthy in their 90’s …maybe that is long enough to live…for some. But for me, IF I was lucky enough to have your great genetic substratum, I would do everything possible to target a healthy 130! You are practically a spring chicken. You might wish to go for less than 4 mmolar cholesterol by following Dr G and the advice of this crowd. You might try eating a plant-based, whole foods diet. You should be studied! What are the chances you would volunteer to be my lab rat? :)Hi Coacervate, Thank you for your reply.My point is that I love fatty meat, but look what it did to my blood fats. The fatty biltong (jerky?) I ate all my life, salt-cured, was not a good choice. I changed to exactly what you recommend “eating a plant-based whole food diet”.My Dad was a great gardener, and we ate organic vegetables from his garden and fruit of all sorts picked from the orchard in the yard – no pesticides. Not many city dwellers have this opportunity, sadly.But you are right: longevity thrived on both sides of my family. And they all died with their minds in brilliant condition.Sure I’ll be your lab rat. I live in hole # 34 in the Western Cape, South Africa.By the way, I have no idea what “4 mmolar cholesterol”means.Dr. Greggory is definitely a national treasure, if ever the words, this world is a better place because of an individual, they can be applied to this man.Okay, so all the diseased people had titanium in their bowels while the healthy people didn’t. So what? That doesn’t prove the titanium causes any negative effects. Maybe both healthy and unhealthy people were eating the same amount of titanium, but the unhealthy people weren’t able to excrete it. Or maybe the unhealthy people did eat more titanium, as they were eating more fast food… Doesn’t mean it was the titanium causing the problems, it could have been the animal proteins or anything else in the fast food. There are many possibilities, just being scientific here.Low partical group: 7/9 with a positive result. Maybe enough of a sample size.Rule of Thumb for small samples: 95% Sample Error Estimate.sqrt(5/(n-3))/2 estimates the 95% confidence interval for worst case random noise caused by binomial or “dice” effects.9 people in the low partical group.sqrt(5/(9-3))/2 = 45.6% Confidence Interval due to dice.Expected variation due to dice. n * sqrt(5/(n-3))/2 = 4So 7 of 9 got better but 4 of 9 is the 95% confidence edge for random dice effects. Thus, I am preparted to be better than 95% sure that random chance did not cause either result.But, after statistical significance is met, that is when one must turn on the thinking cap.Here is an article talking about “Exomes”… Good nanoparticles.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842810/","['animal products', 'animal protein', 'antibiotics', 'arachidonic acid', 'bacteria', 'beef', 'carbon monoxide', 'chewing gums', 'chicken', 'Crohn’s disease', 'endotoxin', 'estrogen', 'fish', 'heterocyclic amines', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'intenstinal flora', 'intestinal inflammation', 'marshmallows', 'meat', 'microparticles', 'nanoparticles', 'plant-based diet', 'powdered sugar', 'processed meat', 'titanium dioxide', 'toxins', 'ulcerative colitis', 'vegan', 'vegetarian']",-,-,-,-,"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/paleolithic-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/GMO/","http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lowering-dietary-antibiotic-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-additives-to-diminish-toxicity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/yersinia-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-eggs-and-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/titanium-dioxide-inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dead-meat-bacteria-endotoxemia/",-

So many people online and in the health community rave about the therapeutic and nutritional value of eating sprout-greens, as well as sprouted raw beans, and seeds, but is this actually accurate and documented by science or just assumptions, maybe even wrong? I see a sunflower sprout as something that should probably be left in the ground, for it wants and is designed to grow up to be a big sunflower, no? Wouldn’t the baby sprout contain some anti-nutrients to deter (humans!) from stopping its’ lifecycle to grow up to be a 5 foot flowering, beautiful plant?We have so many videos on sprouting! For more information on raw foods I’d suggest Brenda Davis’s book, “Becoming Raw” – perhaps the most referenced book on rw foods. She did a guest post about paleo diets, too.Does this imply that if a woman who hasn’t been on statins develops breast cancer, putting her on statins will increase her chances of survival? In other words, are statins the next breast-cancer drug?Hi. Here is a great video that mentions statins and breast cancer risk that may really help. Thanks for your post.http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/846189?src=emailthis A study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncologists meeting this year said that statins lower the risk of cancer death in some types of cancer. The study says statins don’t affect cancer incidence.Hi Sandra. I can’t seem to open your link. Do you mind resending? Perhaps we need to update some information, but it seems there is concern of taking statins, as it’s associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.It doesn’t help that breast cancer and heart disease (and most dis-eases) are such sensitive and personal topics for many and I have found it difficult to suggest a healthier diet (even with referring to blogs like this and medical sites) when a pill can ‘do it all’. Thank you for all the knowledge you share, as it encourages me to stay open-minded and true to my stance.Read this today:http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/treating-more-adults-with-statins-would-be-cost-effective-way-to-boost-heart-health/?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Harvard%20Chan%20School%20Update%20July%202015%20–%20Friends%20(1)&utm_content=Yikes! Is there not a better cost-effective way to help the public reduce heart disease risk? Semi rhetorical question. Thanks for the link very interesting.A friend of mine was diagnosed with ALS last year. One of possible causes of the disease inhis case: 10 year use of statins. The neurologist took him off the medication immediately.I’m confused about dietary cholesterol. You appear to imply here and in other places that dietary cholestrol should be avoided as it causes an increase in serum cholesterol, yet even T.Collin Campbell acknowloges that this is not the case. My understanding is that animal protein causes the body to over-produce cholesterol. Maybe it doesn’t matter as animal proteins come with lots of cholesterol and sat fat anyway, so the health recommendations would be the same? I would appreciate some clarification on this. Thanks for the great work!Hi Marty. Let me try to help. Saturated fat boosts cholesterol much more than dietary cholesterol, but dietary cholesterol still raises blood cholesterol slightly. This British Medical Journal blog explains more. Dr. Greger commented at the end stating “Indeed the Institute of Medicine did not set a tolerable upper intake limit for cholesterol “because any intake level above 0% of energy increased LDL cholesterol concentration.”[1] So the optimal intake may indeed by zero, as heart disease remains the leading killer in both the UK and US. [1] Trumbo PR, Shimakawa T. Tolerable upper intake levels for trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. Nutr Rev. 2011;69(5):270-8.” His video on Optimal Cholesterol Levels may also help. Animal protein can be detrimental to health in excess, but I am uncertain its effects on cholesterol. I would agree with your statement that “Maybe it doesn’t matter as animal proteins come with lots of cholesterol and sat fat anyway.”Is it cholesterol itself that promotes cancer, or is it “excess” cholesterol? I’m curious because our bodies create cholesterol as needed. So is it just the excess that we may get from our diet that is a problem or any cholesterol that’s a problem?But that woman in the commercial seems so happy. She acts like she won the lottery when she finds out that she is “down with Crestor” then she dances down the street, high fiving everybody on her way. Her friends congratulate her on the great news.I have normal cholesterol, and I’m never *that* happy.These are what I call the “dancing fat*sses”…their drugs make them happy…usual corporate swill. I have Ch of 145 and I’m concerned about it being too low. From what I read the elderly live longer with higher Ch…the real issue being OXIDIZED Ch…not blood levels.I wonder how many are taking statins when their cholesterol is high due to an iodine deficiency. Iodineresearch.comAnother translation accomplished in Portuguese – http://nf.focoempatico.net/estatinas-causam-cancro-da-mama/Wow, I’d sure like to see that 30% drop in cholesterol….I’ve been vegan x 3 years, and my levels are still higher than the usual recommended levels.Dr. Greger says that statins are remarkably safe, considering that they are drugs, and mentions the proviso that occasionally they cause muscle pain. What about diabetes? I’ve read a couple studies indicating that those taking statins have anywhere from 50% to more than double the rate of contracting diabetes as those not taking statins (those taking low dose statins had less diabetes).","['breast cancer', 'cancer', 'cancer survival', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cardiovascular health', 'cholesterol', 'estrogen', 'heart disease', 'heart health', 'LDL cholesterol', 'nuts', 'phytosterols', 'plant-based diets', 'plasma membrane', 'pumpkin seeds', 'seeds', 'side effects', 'statins', 'vegans', 'vegetarians', ""women's health""]",-,-,-,-,"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/paleolithic-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/GMO/","http://nutritionfacts.org/video/statin-cholesterol-drugs-and-invasive-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-cholesterol-patently-false-and-misleading-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-feeds-breast-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-in-meat-and-dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/statin-muscle-toxicity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-attacks-and-cholesterol-purely-a-question-of-diet/","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16565487,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329299,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22806241,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18338406,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16381630,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23833125,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25304447,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14527636,"

Animal protein isn’t healthy for your body. It’s responsible for the large spike in the “diseases of affluence” never seen before on such a massive scale until people started consuming animal products. Watch the video I mentioned (that he links in his PS paragraph) and you’ll see that your precautions don’t protect you completely from the health dangers of meat. Veganism is much healthier. Not to mention, if you can survive off a vegan diet and be healthy, why would you want to support needless cruelty to animals?If animal protein was so unhealthy for humans, why would it be the only way to get vitamin B12?Joxer the Mighty: That’s a common question and understandable given all the misinformation out there. But the truth is, meat is not the only way to get B12. Mammals do not make B12. Bacteria does. You can get B12 from natural (ie, dirty) water and even from unwashed veggies when grown in natural soil. You can get a whole lot of B12 from eating feces. (I have to wonder how much of the B12 modern meat eaters are getting really comes from feces soaked meat.) Of course, these are not safe sources of B12, any more than meat in general and animal protein in particular is.Here is a helpful article from Dr. Greger on B12 that explains a bit more. And there is some great videos on this site that also explain more about B12: http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/25/vegan-b12-deficiency-putting-it-into-perspective/Do we know whether the same is true of cooking and eating insects?THE PERFECT DIETN.B: FAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MACRONUTRIENTIf you are overweight, pre-diabetic or diabetic, or not running on eight cylinders, you may be a victim of carbohydrate poisoning! The most killing diseases facing us today – including obesity – are a result of the overemphasis on carbohydrates. This can be corrected by grading and restricting carbohydrates – and emphasizing natural dietary fat and complete animal protein.Food is our fuel. Much depends on what we choose to eat. How long and how well we live depends on how we “fuel” our brain, heart, hormones, kidneys, liver, lungs, skin and bones. Human cells, tissues, and organs function optimally if they are provided what they need when they need it.It’s easy to argue that fat is the most important macronutrient. Our 70 trillion cells are protected by two layers of fat: lipid bilayers. Along with protein and water, fat – much of it saturated – is what our bodies are made of. Though included in our diets, carbohydrates should be chosen carefully and restricted in order to keep blood sugar in a narrow healthy range.For most people, carbohydrates should be restricted to about 60 grams daily, depending on any illness that may be present, or a consideration for a person’s environmental conditions. (A lumberjack will eat more than a tailor.) The body will more easily maintain itself and regenerate health if carbohydrates do not overwhelm hormone systems that keep blood sugar under tight optimum control.Carbohydrates (carbs) are sugars by another name. Carbohydrates are abundant in fruits, vegetables and grains – in boxed cereals – and in all floury or sweet packaged products. Remember, in the gut, even healthy-sounding broccoli, cauliflower, and zucchini turn into glucose (blood sugar). Our biological requirement for carbohydrates is: Zero.Some foods are a combination of the three macronutrients. As an example, milk contains fat, protein, and carbohydrate. There is protein in many foods (beans, corn, grains, mushrooms, peas, seeds and nuts) but only animal foods (chicken, cheese, eggs, fish, organ meat, pork, and red meat) provide complete high value protein. (Egg white is pure protein.)The Perfect Diet emphasizes complete animal protein for the maintenance and regeneration of the body and high octane fats to provide energy for – among other things – the digestion and assimilation of protein. The Perfect Diet is not a high protein diet; it’s a high fat diet that offers strength and energy and it’s simple to follow.The first meal of the day should include fat and protein – about 30 grams of protein before noon. Good quality eggs – 7 grams of protein each – provide high value protein and many other key nutrients (choline). If you eat a 3 or 4 egg omelet before noon, you may not be hungry until dinner. If you eat high value foods, you may not need to eat as much.As our main fuel, we must choose between fats and carbohydrates. Emphasizing two fuels is a mistake. Our bodies react adversely to “mixing fuels.” Since fats are energy and nutrient dense – and don’t raise blood sugar – they will more fully provide satiety and satisfy the energy needs of the body.(In the Perfect Diet, there is no need for routine snacking or eating more than two meals a day. Eating many small meals a day will result in the digestive organs getting no rest which can lead to a variety of digestive tract ailments.)On the Perfect Diet, we will cut carbs – not calories. Depending on your circumstances, you can eat up to 3,000 or more calories a day but you will still burn fat. You can pretty much live on steak, chicken, and green salads. For breakfast you can eat as many eggs as you like – and bacon too. You can put full fat dressing on your salads and butter on your steak.Our bodies evolved to run optimally on a diet emphasizing protein and natural fat, eggs, fish, and meat. We are suffering today because we are eating a diet dominated by carbohydrates; and a high percentage have been milled and refined. The basis of the Perfect Diet is restricting the macronutrient (carbohydrate) associated with a metabolic disturbance that causes weight gain, hunger, diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome, and heart disease.This diet can work for you. It’s easy to follow and you can eat as much as you want; you’ll never go hungry. Dietary abundance goes hand-in-hand with feeling on top of the world. If you need to, you’ll lose inches as well as pounds. When you burn fat as a fuel you are moving in the direction of health, stabilized blood sugar, lower triglycerides, increased HDL, and energy throughout the day.Here are the Paleo Principles:1. Eat foods that sustained human beings before we wrecked our health by becoming settled, citified farmers. Eat meat, fish, eggs, avocados, leafy vegetables, preferably fermented (sauerkraut) or steamed and berries, nuts, wild seeds.2. Eat foods raised in accordance with their own natural environment. The animals you eat should eat grass if they have four stomachs. The birds you eat should eat worms, bugs and weeds. The plants you eat should be grown in soil that does not require pesticides and herbicides.3. Eat foods that are like a stick of nutritional dynamite, instead of like a wimpy little firecracker. Everything you eat should provide your body with a concentrated source of nutrients for maintaining, building, repairing and fueling your body. A bowl of rice is a wimpy firecracker. A piece of grass-raised beef is dynamite.4. Eat your carbohydrate in accordance with your energy expenditure. Carbohydrate only has one function in the human body: to provide energy. If you are primarily sedentary at work or at your computer, then don’t eat carbohydrates. All they do is give you a SUGAR spike.5. Prepare your foods the way that humans have traditionally prepared foods. Certain foods require specific handling methods in order to make their limited nutrients bioavailable to the human body.6. Don’t eat things that aren’t food. Food should be easily identifiable. Soy milk, protein bars and sports drinks are a far cry from any food that exists in the natural world. Better nutrition through chemistry is A BAD IDEA.7. Eat a wide range of traditional, life-giving FATS that have not been damaged by processing. Your body can use FATS to make nearly all that it needs to survive, along with water.8. Eat foods that are rich in lacto-bacteria to replenish the micro-organisms of our gut.9. Eat some of your foods raw including animal foods or slightly cooked i.e., liver. Nutrient content and bioavailability of food is affected by preservation and cooking method.10. Do not partition your food wastefully. If you are eating an egg, eat the whole egg. If you are eating an animal, eat the organs, muscles and bones.11. Get to know your food supply. Know your hunters, your butchers, your gatherers, your storekeepers and your farmers. Know what foods are produced in your own geographic environment.12. Know yourself. How do you feel, perform and look? If the way you feel, perform or look isn’t top level, change something about the way you eat, move and care for yourself!!!The Low DownThe human body is a metabolic marvel comprised of dozens of little systems connecting to create one complex system. Food is the fuel, the input, for the systems. Our metabolic machinery evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to function optimally on select fuels. These fuels were the original, Primal foods of the human organism. Over these hundreds of thousands of years our Big Game Hunting, small prey capturing, scavenging, foraging, gathering, opportunistic ancestors accumulated experience and wisdom about nourishing themselves. They learned to preserve and predigest foods to maximize the quality of their metabolic fuel. Eventually they learned to cook foods without destroying the important nourishing properties of the food, and then they learned to heal the human body with food.Only recently in the human evolutionary experience, have we abandoned all these hundreds of thousands of years of accumulated epicurean genius.Today we fuel our marvelous, complex metabolic machinery with crap invented to create profits for agribusiness.We have become dumb eaters.As we regain our eating intelligence it doesn’t make sense to move back to the savannah and put out our fires or climb into our cave and pretend there is a glacier next door. It makes sense to fuel our bodies with all the primal human foodstuffs, prepared and preserved with accumulated ancestral wisdom and served up for the undeniable desires of the human taste buds. Primal, paleolithic food choices, handled according to ancient food ways resulting in outrageously good food.Human beings do not have a biological requirement for carbohydrate.We can survive just fine without carbohydrate. Many people have done it, entire cultures have done it, and you could too if you wanted. You probably don’t, so it makes sense to learn how to eat carbohydrates in a way that they will help you instead of harming you.Carbohydrate is a one-trick pony in terms of your metabolic requirements. It is solely used to produce energy for you. When you eat carbohydrate in excess of what you need for energy production you will store it as body fat because there is NOTHING else for your body to do with it!! Your body can’t use it to grow your bones or repair your muscles or produce hormones. The best thing you can get from your carbohydrates, since our modern life really doesn’t require all that much physical energy, are their associated micronutrients.Give your carbohydrates a long hard look and be ruthless in your assessment of what good they do you. Are they packed with minerals? Are they loaded with phytonutrients? Are they brimming with antioxidants? Are they dripping with water-soluble vitamins? Use the carbohydrates in your diet to flood your body with real, whole food sources of critical nutrients.It is easy to line up your carbohydrates and pick the very best ones. If you pour a cup of water onto your carbohydrate will it be cleaner? Or will it turn into mush? If you pour water on fruits or vegetables they are more ready to eat!!! If you pour water onto flour, cereal, crackers, bread, desserts and candy it will be disgusting!You can use the color test. Are your carbohydrates white, beige, tan, or brown? Then they are lifeless. They have very little to offer you.Are they all shades of green, orange, red, yellow, blue, purple, pink? Then they have abundant nutrients for you.You can also use the raw/cooked test. Would you be able to eat a handful of your carbohydrate raw? Would you eat a handful of raw rice, raw corn or raw black beans? Only if you wanted a few less teeth and a vicious stomachache!! You might not enjoy raw vegetables, but they are certainly fine (and some are more nutritious) to consume uncooked.As carbohydrates go, grains and beans possess the fewest nutrients and the most energy (calories). You need less calories and more nutrition so choose vegetables as your carbohydrates. Many people panic at the idea of not stuffing themselves each day with bread, crackers, bagels, pasta, rice, beans, cereal, and tortillas. “But what will I eat?!?!?!?!” they wail. Below is a very long list of excellent carbohydrate choices.When choosing fruits and vegetables, choose those grown in the most sustainable manner in the healthiest soil. They will have the most nutrition. Choose fruits in season, rotating your choices throughout the year just as our ancestors did before refrigerated warehouses and cross-global food transport. Choose varieties labeled “heirloom” if possible in order to ensure a diverse, safe food supply. Often older varieties of fruits, especially apples, contain less simple sugars and more nutrientsYes, heck yes! I feel like crap when I have low fat, low protein and high carb. Total crap. My face is puffy and I get terrible acne and pains all over. Reading this article just makes me think I should stop eating altogether and just drink water. Oh, that causes cancer, too! Maybe we should just not eat or drink anything at all. Coconut oil is awesome.What about roasted veggies when the outer edges get burned? Does the burned part contain cacinogens?Its the animal protein that leads to carcinogen production, so no.Yes all burned food meat or veggies contain carcinogens! :) Don’t eat black friend food. It cause higher risk of cancer. I never eat the burned part of food. I always cut it out and throw it. Google it! I’m not lying! ;)Is microwaving meats any safer than the other methods?Heating in oven or cooking in water is the most healthy I guess. I found some links about microwaving. Please take a look! :)http://www.naturalnews.com/030651_microwave_cooking_cancer.html http://chetday.com/microwave.html http://www.relfe.com/microwave.html http://www.mindfully.org/Food/Irradiate-Microwave-Effects-FoodMay96.htmDavid: I didn’t analyze all the points in the links you provided, but I did glance at a couple. Those pages are filled with myths/urban legends/inaccurate understanding of science as far as I can tell. If you are interested in the “other side of the story”, check out this page:http://www.drmyattswellnessclub.com/Microwave.htmJust something to think about.I like the smokey flavor from my previous meat-eating days. My spice purveyor makes a very tasty Mesquite Smoke Powder that I like to add to savory dishes. Is there any health information on this kind of thing, or even Liquid Smoke?Good question. I asked Dr. Greger the same question because my wife and I use a small amount of liquid hickory smoke in a split pea recipe we make regularly. Dr. Greger said that he knew of no studies and since then I haven’t seen any. However, he would guess and I would agree that continuous exposure of cells to it might reveal damage. However occasional use should not be a problem.I didn’t know which was the best place to ask, so what’s better: a low chicken based diet or a low bovine meat based diet?Since each approach is not healthy for you it would depend on what you are trying to accomplish. They both have cholesterol, saturated fats, trans-fats, hormones, antibiotics, dioxins, etc. I would say for weight loss I would go with the lean chicken less calorie dense… of course then you have the arsenic to contend with. If you are trying to build muscle strength you can “dope” by eating steaks which have added male hormones. I would review all the video’s and references on this website and choose your path. While you are at it I would also research the value of a low fat whole plant food diet with Vitamin B12 and consider a third option.Isn’t it the incomplete digestion of protein that contributes to disease and cancer, as well, rather than just consuming animal protein? I thought complete sources of protein were essential for growth and survival. Beans are not going to cut it for a growing child or pregnant woman–look at the Brewer Diet and its incredible results in maternal and infant health. There is something missing from all of this information–maybe that it’s bad to eat cooked animal protein and we should eat it raw or very lightly cooked or maybe that our digestion is so poor and lacking enzymes that we cannot properly digest proteins, hence causing cancer. How about raw pastured milk and raw pastured eggs, or raw fish? What kind of studies have been done on these?As I have posted on NF before from Jeff Novick…“Plant protein can meet protein requirements when a variety of plant foods is consumed and energy needs are met. Research indicates that an assortment of plant foods eaten over the course of a day can provide all essential amino acids and ensure adequate nitrogen retention and use in healthy adults; thus, complementary proteins do not need to be consumed at the same meal ”http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/2009_ADA_position_paper.pdfAs Jeff Novick puts it..Many say that plants foods are incompleteIf “incomplete” means not containing all the essential amino acids then…. (the incomplete protein theory)1) All plant foods are complete as they contain all the essential amino acids.2) the only food that is not a complete protein is an animal food, gelatin.If “incomplete” means lacking in sufficient quantity of one or more amino acids…(the limiting amino acid theory)1) Getting all the amino acids in at once at the same meal, or even in the same day, as some may suggest, is not necessary due to the amino acid pool, which is a circulating level of amino acids in the blood, that the body can draw from if needed. As long as one follows a whole foods plant based diet, the amino acid pool will maintain a sufficient stock of any potentially needed (or limiting) amino acids.2) However, as long as one consumes enough calories, eats a variety of food, and limits junk foods and refined foods, and is not an all fruit diet, then they will get in enough protein and enough amino acids in sufficient quantity. There will be no limiting amino acids3) there is some evidence that the amino acids that are slightly lower (but adequate) in plant foods, may actually be a benefit to health and longevity and not a concern. This evidence stems from the fact that eating foods that resemble the protein structure of humans causes the liver to release excess amounts of the growth hormone, IGF-1, which accelerates aging and promotes tumor growth.Most every major health organization including the NAS, the WHO and the ADA all recognize these statements to be true.Certainly, the products lean, complete or dietetic have a calorie intake lower than the other, but that does not mean that we can eat at will. These products alone cannot provide a full contribution in indispensable nutrients for the body. Check their composition will allow you to compose menus really balanced.

I have definitely noticed the maple syrup odor! Pretty funny… Not sure if I’ve noticed an increase in my strength yet but it’s only been a couple weeks yet. Also read online that it helps lower your blood sugar (and thus is helpful as a supplement with those with low appetite) and I have noticed this too, anecdotally, so I take mine with food.We buy whole fenugreek seeds and grind them to powder in our vitamix. Then we add a tablespoon to our smoothies everyday. Our armpits do smell like maple syrup! It’s so weird but we are used to it now:)Michael what are your thoughts on Fenugreek pills versus Fenugreek powder? Will that have the same effect on athletic performance?In the study in question they were using ground fenugreek in pill formWe sprinkle on top of our sprouted muffin and crunchy almond butter. Yummy!Here’s a wonderful recipe using fenugreek: http://www.ivu.org/recipes/african/ethiopian-style.html Enjoy!For adding more fenugreek into the diet:1. Mix equal parts of fenugreek, cumin and paprika into the coffee grinder and process. Use this as herb mix por adding to veggies. Some of my favorite options: -Roasted cauliflower florets: cut a medium cauliflower into florets, rub some olive oil and lemon juice, sprinkle spices and bake until crispy. -Zucchini sticks: same procedure as with cauliflower. 2. Make some pesto/hummus: add herbs mixture to 1/2 cup of soaked nuts, lemon juice or apple cider vinegar and blend in the Vitamix. 3. Also may add powder fenugreek+flax meal to oatmeal.Any idea how to grind whole fenugreek seed to produce powder? I have a spice and herb grinder and the grinder can t handle fenugreek seeds -they are too hard.I wonder if the nutritional value of the sprouts is comparable to eating the ground seeds.Sprout them!! It only takes two to three days in a glass jar depending on ambient temperatures. Sprouting seeds–ANY seeds–“wakes them up” and increases Vitamin C content. It’s also renders them even easier to digest than it would be for the body to extract nutrients in dried powder form. Besides all of that, it’s fun!!Clifford Santa MonicaGood point. And Fenugreek seeds are very easy to sprout.Amla is yucky? I recently had the opportunity to travel to India, where I bought some organic dried amla. It tasted like dried strawberries!That sure wasn’t my experience. I think of amla as one of the most bitter substances I’ve ever tried. Perhaps if you get it fresh from the source, it taste better as you say.I went out and purchased the ground fenugreek yesterday and this morning i had toast with Black Strap Molasses and a generous sprinkling of the fenugreek. What I would like to know is how much of this spice do we need to match the requirements used in the experiment? Thanks!I soak a teaspoon of seeds in water overnight then chew them or add to smoothie. Not yummy, but It works for me.Dr. Gregor, Please let us know if any data is published about *women* and fenugreek. If I recall correctly, it was only in men that it showed the benefits you mentioned.In the meantime, my husband and I just toss a spoonful of whole fenugreek seeds into our smoothie batch and don’t notice a different taste at all. Our smoothie recipe is fluid, but always contains flax seeds, kale, spinach, broccoli, pineapple (canned) for taste, mixed frozen berries, and maybe an apple or citrus fruit or two, and molasses. Sometimes we toss in a hibiscus flower, since we have a bush in our yard. It can’t taste too bad, since my 6 and 8 year olds will drink it! We tried adding amla powder….no way, made the whole thing too bitter!What is the recommended amount per day for strength training?Hi Dr. Greger, Love watching your videos and reading blogs. Fenugreek is very popular in India. I sprout the fenugreek seeds, ready in 3 to 5 days ,easy to sprout.it an get sticky if u add too much water. Sprouted fenugreek seeds used in soups, salads specially sprouted moong bean salad. I use it in detox broths. I remember my mom and my grandmother eating a tsf or two of fenugreek seeds raw,just swallowing,not chewing. It is easier to swallow if soaked for few hours. They said it was good for” joint pains”. The most popular Ayurvedic food,Khichari which has rice and lentils also has fenugreek seeds for health. When sown in the ground, fenugreek seeds produce slightly bitter greens called methi leaves,used in making Indian Roti or corn breads.Dried methi leaves are available inhttp://www.tarladalal.com/recipes-using-fenugreek-seeds-991Fenugreek seeds are easily sprouted. I bought seeds claiming to be for that purpose. They are organic and have a very high germination rate. I don’t know if the seeds at your local ethnic market would work just as well but probably worth a try. Once sprouted they are very mild and agreeable. I eat them raw in salads or my homemade sauerkraut. (Also very easy to make!) Presumably they have the same benefits as unsprouted fenugreek and may be more bioavailable. Or maybe not but they sure are easy to eat this way.The title of this article is totally misleading.The study was done on Torabolic, paid by its manufacturer (Indus Biotech), Torabolic is extracted from Fenugreek. and it consists of 70 percent of galactomannan and who knows what else. You could consume pounds and pounds of Fenugreek and yet not see any of the benefits of Torabolic. Worse yet, it seems Torabolic causes muscle mass to grow the, but researchers have no idea how, so the long term effects are unknown. To imply that just taking fenugreek is going to induce strength and muscle growth is misleading and irresponsible. It is sad that this website is resorting to the same misinformation tactics used by the meat and dairy industry.ahaVery valid points. Your comment has shaken my confidence in Dr. Greger’s reports, which are supposed to save us time and be expertly reviewed.I see a lot of articles about increasing muscle strength, or building more muscle, but are there any dietary adjustments that can increase muscle flexibility?Do you really mean tendons?Will my breast reduce to its original size if I stop taking fenugreekRecently started taking fenugreek seeds, really cheap here where I’m at.. I usually take it at night before bed, boil some water and put in teaspoon of this stuff.This study seems to indicate there was no difference between those who consumed fenugreek vs a placebo – http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1550-2783-7-34.pdfWas this study independently done? I read that the lab who conducted the study is a supplier of metrx.Sprout them! I learned to do this at the Optimum Health Institute in San Diego. Take a handful, put them in a sprouting bag or jar (follow sprouting instructions) and in 3-4 days you have a powerhouse of fenugreek sprouts. Way more effective and nutritious than the grounded seeds alone. The taste? Not my personal favorite but combined with other foods like chicken, beef, avocado or cheese the sprout flavor transforms into pure deliciousness and enhances the flavor of the entire dish!Soaking & sprouting it is a wonderful way of consuming it. No bitterness & more nutritionThe best way to consume large quantities of the sprouts is not in salads although they do enhance any salad. To eat one pound of sprouts puree the sprouts by blending with 1 cup of water or, better, 1 cup of rejuvalec. Add the puree to the batter of any flax cracker mix.For rejuvelac, see http://www.helynskitchen.com/2013/11/cultured-cashew-pimento-cheddar-cheese.html?m=1For cracker recipies, see ( http://www.livway.org/dehydratedfoods.htm)Thomas: Nice tip! Thanks for sharing both the idea and the links!Hello All, am from India. We use fenugreek seeds in almost all dishes, very moderately since the seeds are little bitter. The best method is you can buy fenugreek leaves called ” Methi leaves” in any Indian grocery store. Clean them and saute as you do with spinach. I usually heat 1 tsp olive oil in a pan, add cumin, mustard seeds, minced ginger, garlic and add these methi leaves. add salt and turmeric, cover pan for 5 mins and its ready. Or, you can buy split lentils, pressure cook lentils till t hey become mushy. add the before mentioned sauteed to this cooked lentil, add salt, chilli powder. its taste yummy and healthy.

Both of which I used to like when I was not vegan. Now I have no migraines or swelling gums after meals. Great info !” observed an excessive proliferation of human breast cancer cells in certain types of plastic containers”What type of plastic containers were the human breast cancer cells found in? I’m trying to get my mind around this strange sentence.Oh boy, this video freaks me out. Salmon as even a future possibility in my diet is now off the table. Is this as real and concerning as the science is suggesting? Farmed raised and wild salmon carry the same toxic level, in this regard? I’ll avoid both.Please do more videos on fish, especially canned fish. Lots of people subscribe to the benefits of eating canned sardines and salmon for the calcium content (fish bones).

Is there a better powder to mix it with that confectioners sugar? Something that I don’t have to mail-order?As it is 1/32 of a tsp is 80mg.Why don’t you just take a pill?http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/Because I have 50 grams of powder that’s why.Hi Wade. Nice picture change ;-) I am not too familiar with the powders or dilutions. I would say take it in high doses but not every day. I am sure you’ve seen Dr. Greger’s Optimal Nutrition Recommendations (as llilly mentioned, too) and his video on where to find the cheapest source of B12.Exactly. I’m shooting for 2500-5000mcg once per week, but need to bulk it up in order to get enough to measure. Yeah, I forget that changing my FB profile pic changes my avatar over here. No telling what will be next. That one is a mobile selfie on a bumpy back road, blurred at full res. Because.Hmmm, I wonder how Okinawans stayed so healthy being on a near plant-based, nutrient rich diet if the number of animal products they eat are so low?Even the minimal amounts of fish and shellfish they ate contained B12 in a rich pure form. A lifetime of eating creatures from the ocean, even in small amounts, probably added up. My guess. And they also ate pig, yet in small amounts, and this probably added up over time to contributing to B12. These people had bodies that were constantly exposed to cholesterol, their organs had to process animal products. It seems to be there might be a synergy with nature. Any early vegans ate bugs, worms, insects, all that stuff, (full of blood, cholesterol, digestive organs (poo, pee!) complete proteins, B12) even if it wasn’t intentional. It was slathered allover the plants growing in nature and they ate away without removing all these creatures.With the B12 issue in mind, I try not to be too fastidious about cleaning the food I pick from the garden. (So maybe some bugs, dirt, but no chemicals!) Am I “torturing” myself unnecessarily or is it a good idea? lol… Anyone?Good idea if it’s from your garden, but I guess you should have reliable source of B12 anyway, just to be sure.Frankly, as Dr. Greger suggest is far safer to just take Vit B12.You are gambling getting parasites there. (Nor you know if you are getting enough B12)In other times people had no options, but now we have the best of both world, no need to risk getting malaria from bacteria in water, nor parasites from soil, just to get Vit B12… you can cheat and get a safe, reliable source these days. :)They probably do quite often what Grandpa and I did in 1952. Out in the garden, pull a carrot, wipe it off on Grandpa’s pantleg, and eat. People don’t do that anymore.Yes, I agree JoAnn. B12 doesn’t come from animals. It comes from bacteria in the soil. Cows, pig, and sheep don’t care that much if theres’ a bit of dirt in their food. They can’t clean it. If you grow your own food organically, you don’t have to worry about the soil, and you can just be a little lean hyper-clean. It helps with asthma and gut bacteria too. John S PDX ORMaybe it’s the sweet potatoes? At least that is what Dr. Barnard always mentions when we talks about their longevity. I am sure it is a mix of healthy lifestyle factors and diet. Dr. Greger talks about this more in his longevity blogs and videos. “This may also help explain the longevity of populations like the Okinawa Japanese, who have about half our mortality rate. The traditional Okinawan diet is only about 10% protein, and practically no cholesterol, because they ate almost exclusively plants. Less than one percent of their diet was fish, meat, eggs, and dairy – the equivalent of one serving of meat a month and one egg every two months. Their longevity is surpassed only by vegetarian Adventists in California, who have perhaps the highest life expectancy of any formally studied population in history.”Sweet potatoes and possibly the beans. All the Blue Zones with their extraordinary longevity and health have one food in common – beans of one kind or another.Can a Homocysteine test thus serve as a great test for B12 levels in plant diet eaters? But what if you and a blood test for B12 already and the level appeared very good? Is there any reason to be concerned regardless?Yeah, your blood level of B12 might be high but it might not mean the body is using it and absorbing it into the cells.Homeocysteine and MMA levels determine this, in my experience. And “fake” B12’s (spirulina, etc.) will show a high B12 when you test the blood, but this doesn’t mean the body is receiving true bioavailable B12. I suppose the same goes for some B12 supplements.I recently had a “hemagram and differential” and “comprehensive metabolic panel” so do either of those usually contain a homocysteine test or maybe another test that serves as a good indicator for homocysteine? I additionally had folate and b12 tests in that group of tests. The looked good too. (Is higher always better for those?)get the exact test done. MMA-METHYLMALONIC ACID. HOMOCYSTEINE. BOT ARE BLOOD TESTS.Thanks for exact references. I probably don’t need those tests however as my B12 nearly hits the high end of the range and folate apparently off the chart at >24.0 with good levels starting at 5.4 ng/mL.Hey Tobias, Yes higher is better for B12 regardless and better for folate (when coming from whole food plant sources). You sound VERY knowledgable about plant-based nutrition, but I love an opportunity to share this Dr. G. video about folate from plants vs folic acid from supplements Plants rule! ;P In health, JenI watched this video again. Thanks. I don’t use any of those supplements so looks like I’m good there. I might seem very knowledgeable but really I’m just good at spotting the fakers. :)Not necessarily, One can also depress homocysteine by consuming a lot of betaine (mostly from beets and spinach), which may make homocysteine unreliable. Dr. Greger comments on the methylmalonic acid and holotranscobalamin B-12 tests in this video.But the person should not assume this with work and therefore not get the blood level tested. I tried this and it did not work. I had to add in some fish and crustaceans, as for me it was a B12 issue and the pills did not lower Homocysteine, nor high consumption of beets or greens. But I think all vegans should get tested, and sooner rather than later, for homecysteine and MMA in order to truly judge the merits of their B12 status as well as any possible detrimental effects occurring in body due to unknown high homecysteine levels (unless one gets checked). I think some folks are high in homocysteine due to lack of the folate, and for others it is the B12 issue, but just assuming all is fine without these blood tests seems like long-term russian roulette for vegans.Wouldn’t homocystine levels be higher on a diet high in methionine (which would be egg whites, also eggs, beef, chicken, salmon? I’m vegan and my level is 6.4 which I believe is good?Let’s me say that I was discouraged about inquiring into more tests by reading Andrew Weil’s webpage on the topic. He says the test often isn’t covered by insurance, doctors rarely agree to it, and it costs $100. Now, let’s see if Dr Greger’s vid enlightens…The tests still doesn’t seem necessary. If low levels are found by those tests (mma, the newer test, etc) the solution is to take supplements. I already take supplements.I would still make sure MMA is tested if your doctor feels you may be low in B12. Better safe than sorry in my opinion, as it is such an important vitamin!My doctor isn’t really concerned about this at all. She only ordered the B12 at my suggestion. Anyway. That test put me on high edge of the range, so she has more reason to not be concerned. Folate was off the chart high. But if I could confirm that it’s easy to get private tests and it’s not costly, I’d do it in a second.Tobias: I once had a similar question. Here is the response that I got back from “suepy”:“Dr Mark Hyman, author of The Blood Sugar Solution, recommends going to this website for self testing: http://www.saveonlabs.com/ which uses Quest Diagnostics, or you could go to http://www.walkinlab.com/ which uses Labcorp.”I haven’t actually tried it yet myself. But being able to get whatever info I want about my own body when I want it is really appealing. I don’t think I should have to get permission to find out a key measurement of my body composition. Especially if I’m willing to pay for it. I’m sure I’ll be using something like the above companies at some point in the future.This Hyman dude is the one who took over as Bill Clinton’s dietary adviser after he’d been in the care of Dean Ornish. Converted him from a plant diet. E V I L. :)I’m no fan of Hyman. But no one’s wrong about everything. He suggestions for self-serve labs may be good. At the moment, it is the only suggestions I have to go on.Are you saying that Bill Clinton isn’t doing the vegan diet any more? If so, that’s news to me. How sad.Yes, Bill is OFF vegan. And Hyman too over. He plays it in the exact middle, I believe. (Like the moderation argument, not quite paleo.) Hillary never started and it shows. I’m pretty sure that Chelsea is mostly whole plant, but maybe less of late.How disappointing. But thank you for letting me know. That way I won’t get caught off guard if the subject comes up in future conversations.Cynical Speculation: I wonder if the change had anything to do with Hilary running for president? Is it possible that being on a vegan diet is so controversial (and animal product lobbies so powerful) that they felt they had to eliminate that issue as a potential problem? Because the only other theory I have is that Bill is so wishy-washy and unable to do his own critical thinking that he is swayed by whichever expert he happens to be talking to. Because why else would Bill go from a diet that cured him of his medical problems back to one that got him in trouble in the first place? It makes absolutely no sense to me. I doubt Bill is really like that. It seems more likely to me that the political angle had more to do with it.Just my thoughts on the matter. Obviously, I have no clue on what is really going on.Thanks again for the info.I face a related situation in my home state of Vermont where Sen. Bernie Sanders is running for US President. I strongly support him. But… He serves free ice cream at events. He’s very friendly with Ben & Jerry, the ice cream guys who’ve supported Bernie for a long time. One of Bernie’s biggest issue is climate change. However, he’s likely politically blinded by this, not able or not willing to make the connection between the ice cream he serves and the climate issues he cares so much about, when actually the two issues are so very closely related, as far as I can tell. (Methane gas from animal food production industries apparently rivals CO2 gas as a warming agent.) Vermont prides itself in its dairy industry. The Cabot Co-op (famous cheese makers) represents much needed employment opportunities.I don’t know how we deal with the vast complexities of our present world.What I just wrote to Bernie:Talk of crises in America. What about the health crisis? I’m from Vermont. I was born there. smile emoticon I live there. I support Bernie. I have a question or maybe an observation. Bernie serves free cow’s milk ice cream at events. He’s very friendly with Ben & Jerry, the ice cream guys who’ve supported Bernie for a long time. One of Bernie’s biggest issues is climate change. However, does he see the direct connection between the milk-based ice cream that he serves and the climate issues he cares so much about? The two issues are very closely related, as far as I can tell. Methane gas from animal food production industries apparently rivals CO2 gas as a warming agent. Vermont prides itself on its dairy industry. I know. My own father ran a dairy in Jericho in the 40s. The Cabot Co-op (famous cheese makers) represents much needed employment opportunities. I know. I use to eat that cheese. But, yes, I went strict vegetarian 3 years ago. So, what gives? Anyway. Beyond this, there is a lot of evidence that shows that shifting to diets based almost entirely on plant foods could dramatically improve the health of people in the US (and everywhere in the world) and cut national health care costs dramatically by reducing rates of degenerative diseases (heart disease, cancer, etc). A total conversion could represent, by estimates of credible researchers, of 70 to 80% of medical costs. Anyway. Dairy is a Vermont industry of the past. Jericho had 40-50 farms in the 40s. There are two now. So, maybe focus on shifting Vermont’s economy to a plant diet friendly state, a leader, an outdoorsy, health promoting state. Find new ways to produce our own crops on those old farms. Find ways to get the costs of quality produce down. Find ways to make it work. The money we spend on health care… imagine if it went into developing food independence instead. Millions and millions invested in our people to find better ways to feed us.Right on, Tobias! Berries not Dairies! I, too, like Sen. Sanders and his messages. At the very least, he will shame Hillary into at least sounding more left-leaning than she actually is. I would really like to see a Sanders/Warren ticket. Elizabeth Warren is a real scrapper and would amplify Sen. Sanders’ populist message. The idea of yet another Bush/Clinton election is too horrifying for words.One thing you could add to your message is to appeal to Bernie’s sense of racial justice by reminding him that most Americans of African descent are lactose intolerant, and the idea of foisting cow’s milk on them is unjust. As for Ben & Jerry, I would give Sanders a pass until he can progress in his campaign. That said, why doesn’t Ben & Jerry make a vegan-friendly frozen treat? Maybe they do, but I rarely go down the frozen food aisles anymore so I really would not know.This is an excellent point about ice cream being even more unhealthy for black Americans. Secondly, I seem to recall that Ben & Jerry’s, which was sold to Unilever though maybe Ben & Jerry has some influence on new flavors still.. .yes, they are coming out with their first non-milk product. They are deciding between almond and coconut milk I believe as the milk base. Yes. Confirmed. They’re working on it quite diligently. Though new flavors will appear, I will assume they will remain mostly quite unhealthy for humans except on a limited basis, more standard American diet vegan food. Still unhealthy in general. Poor Ben & Jerry. They both look reasonably healthy but I bet their arteries are filled to the gills with mud.2001 Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry’s had emergency heart bypass surgery, http://www.just-food.com/news/ben-jerrys-cohen-undergoes-heart-surgery_id91592.aspxThis should be more of a topic. Personalities who represent healthy lifestyles, hip products, great images, helping to destroy the health of Americans and others, and profiting immensely from it. Please.Nice letter Tobias. Have you seen Cowspiracy? I live in California and as I am sure you know we have some water issues. After watching that documentary my husband went vegan. He hates to be messed with.No. I’ve allowed the Internet to destroy my taste for watching longer video productions. Seems like I’ve gotten the basic idea w/o watching any of those, I imagine, excellent films. Beyond this, I don’t like to expose myself to horrifying images. I get it really well in a few paragraphs of text. Congrats on your husband going for it.Veganrunner: I found Cowspiracy to be very powerful. But I was thinking that the message might be too much for many people to take in. Good for your husband for being able to take it that information and then act on it. I bet you are happy because you will be getting a healthy husband out of it!Yes I am. that stuff can be so deadly!Tobias: I appreciated both of your posts on this topic. I think the key is this part: “…deal with the vast complexities…” On one hand, it would be way better if Sen. Bernie Sanders was consistent between what his campaign does and what he claims to support. However, I find that there is no such thing as a perfect candidate. So, I just try to find the best fit. (I’m not saying Sen. Sanders is or is not a best fit for me personally or anyone else. I’m just making a point.)When it comes to situations like the one you describe, I try to take solace in what happened with Al Gore: For several years, he just couldn’t bring himself to make the connection between food and climate change. But now (at least last I heard), he has finally gone vegan. And when asked about why The Inconvenient Truth didn’t talk about the animal industry, I have heard that he said/says something like, ‘It was just too inconvenient…” The point being: perhaps Sen. Sanders will wake up some day too just like Al Gore did. And in the mean time, maybe Sanders will start serving the non-dairy Ben and Jerry’s at his functions when those options become available. I think that would be awesome and maybe your letter will help make that happen.I’ve been developing my understanding of all these related matters a whole over the past few weeks. The longer I remain on the good path of plant diet health the more clearly I see the extreme depth of the problem yet also the hope that some people will get the message.re: “The longer I remain on the good path of plant diet health the more clearly I see the extreme depth of the problem yet also the hope that some people will get the message.”Perfect. Beautifully said.A serum B12 test IS a reliable and inexpensive test. If it’s low, you’re pretty sure you’re deficient in B12. Now if you are vegan since a few years and the test is high without you supplementing with B12, it may be because of B12 analogue (B12-like molecule) probably coming from sea weed (include spirulina and so on) which are not biologically active form of the vitamin. The answer to both of this issue are still the same: pharmaceutical grade B12 supplement. Make sure you follow Dr. Greger recommendations 5000 mcg weekly or 500 mcg daily and everything will be ok, don’t bother with 5 mcg or 10 mcg supplement, because it might not be well absorbed with age (over 50 years, according to the Institute of Medicine). MMA and Homocysteine are good test for the proper diagnosis of pernicious anemia, both can be elevated even when a serum B12 is moderate to high, mostly in elderly though. B12 shot are only necessary in case of overt deficiency or pernicious anemia (absorption problem also known as Biermer’s anemia). Hope this is helpfull. In Health, Adrien.I’ve had triglycerides done with no order from a doc. at LabCorp.You are dropping the ball. Get your M.M.A and Homoccyst. tested regardless of what your good doctor thinks. Your high B12 level might not be reflecting if your body is utilizing B12.Yes. I really need some prompting on this one. I didn’t see a doctor for 15 years in my recent past. I have a doctor now… Anyway. My b12 signs are good. I’m supplementing with b12. Remind me of why I need to get more testing. :)Tobias: you can get most blood tests done now without the involvement of a doctor and it’s not very expensive either. Last year I got B12, folate, and lipid levels tested and I think i paid less than $50.My doctor had all of those tests done for me. It’s part of my insurance plan. They all look fine so I’m loath to be concerned, yet maybe I should be.And where do you go to get these test done?I eat plenty of greens and beans, so I suppose I get enough folate. Whien I started supplementing with B-12 lowered my homocystine a little, but it wasn’t until I took betaine supplements (also called trimethyl glycine) that my homocystine dramatically reduced.Chris, I eat plenty of greens and beans, too, and have total cholesterol of 135 (down from an adult lifetime average of 180, after giving up fish two years ago…my last vestige of animal protein). But my homocysteine level has risen from 8 to 9.7 over past 5 years. I’m 52, don’t drink coffee, walk, weight-train, do yoga…healthiest lifestyle possible. Tested negative for MTHFR mutation. My “wellness doc” would like my level to be in the 6 range and has me on 500mcg methylcobalamin daily as well as something called Homocystrol + TMG (a Douglas Labs product), of which 3 capsules provide 1000mg trimethyl glycine. How long did it take to see your homocysteine levels decrease, and what did they go from/to, if you don’t mind sharing that info? Thanks!It’s hard to believe that Americans are deficient in folate given that in the US refined grains are fortified with folate.Lots of people have trouble utilizing the synthetic folic acid used to fortify foods. Real foods, like leafy greens and beans, contain the usable form of folate.“Fortification” doesn’t always equate to “useful nutrition”. I try to avoid “fortified” foods because it’s generally sign of heavy processing and trying to replace some of the good stuff that was removed. Whole Food Rulz.My doc doesn’t recommend folic acid supplements. Recent studies confirm this. I eat a ton of asparagus and greens.Another power-packed video with lots of new information! I wasn’t aware that homocysteine was associated with dementia or methionine intake, nor that fiber increases folate levels in the blood. Question: IIs a daily multivitamin with 12 mcg B12 enough or should vegans take larger doses?According to Dr. Greger you should be taking 250 mcg/day or 2500 mcg/week.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheapest-source-of-vitamin-b12/http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/In an Interview with Emily of Bite Sized Vegan Dr. Greger answered a number of B12 questions as well.https://youtu.be/AvpePfC9hh8In this video and on NutritionFacts.org , Dr. Greger recommends cyanocobalamin. His justification for the choice is economy and stability. My concern with cyanocobalamin is that it is not a naturally occurring compound.For most, cyanocobalamin results in B12 activity. However, there is a rare genetic disorder called combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria, where a natural B12 vitamer, hydroxocobalamin, may work better. Hydroxocobalamin (aka methyl B-12) is the usually prescribed form in Japan, so its widely available at mail order supplement firms, at what appears a 50% surcharge to the cost of cyanocobalamin.Hmm…in my nutrition class, I learned that high homocysteine levels is also associated with CVD. After watching this video, I really have to be strict with B12 supplementationThe view on homocysteine and CVD has changed recently. Homocysteine lowering vitamin trials have no effect on CVD events/mortality (1), and genetic predispositions to higher homocysteine aren’t predictive of cardiovascular risk (2, 3), casting doubt on the assumption that homocysteine plays a causal role. Some researchers have looked to high methionine intake (4, 5) and low folate intake (6, 7, 8, 9), which increase both atherosclerosis and homocysteine, as the real reasons for the association.With respect to dementia, the jury is still a big maybe for a causal role for homocysteine. For Alzheimer’s, a common genetic predisposition to higher homocysteine wasn’t associated with risk in Caucasians, but was in East Asians (10). For vascular dementia and this same gene, there was again no association in Caucasians and Indians, but a robust one in East Asians (11).BTW, these genetic disposition or Mendelian randomization studies are utterly fascinating, if you’re curious about how modern medical science is distinguishing causal risk factors from coincident ones (12.Darryl, my curiosity has gotten the best of me, I have to ask…how’d you get so brilliant?Endless curiosity, and I don’t care for much of what’s on TV.You should take more. I’ve heard ~1500 mcg once a week is enough, I take 2 a week (one Saturday and one Wednesday) just to be sure.Is anybody familiar with the blood homocysteine level and choline (also a B vitamin) intake?If vegans have to take supplements to get b12, does it mean eating animal products is the natural diet for humans? Is it possible humans got enough b12 from other sources in the past? Is their any science on this?Before they started chlorinating the water supply, water had B12. When people grew their own vegetables and ate them without “triple washing” them, they got B12 from vegetables due to soil residues. Vegans’ being unable to get B12 from food is a result of modern living.So for all of us rural folks (lots and lots of us) who yet get our water from wells and springs and grow our own vegetable and harvest from the wild, we are likely getting all the B12 we need. BUT THAT no one has any information on that subject because it might cut into the sales of B12 supps. And really it shall be moot for me soon enough as I’ll be using rainwater only when I move off this stinkin’ grid. If I had money to burn, I’d get my blood tested and my water tested and all of that.Hi Jongreen. I think it’s hard to say. There is some discussion about the matter here. Please follow this link to read the many comments within the thread.it is so important to get tested B-12 and Vitamin DAre your D3 levels normal with only modest supplementation? I found my body had good use for extra D3. The minimums recommended may be low for many healthy individuals.I had it tested last year and my vitamin D was 35, (normal range is 30-80) so I went from 1000 IU every day to 2000 IU. I am going in again this year and will have it tested again.Hi David, welcome back. Re memory loss, not to worry. Nothing much has changed since you’ve been ‘gone.’ ;-) Since you are talking about vitamin D deficiency, it reminds me of this talk given by Dr. Michael F. Holick: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq1t9WqOD-0Good one Lawence.hi, I have been following dr. greger’s recommendation for b12 supplements of about 250 mcg/day. however, my neurologist told me last week that as a vegan with multiple sclerosis I needed 2,500 mcg/day. that’s 10 times more! I don’t know what to think about this. will I just manufacture some expensive pee with this high dose? Olga in DCHi olga. I am not a health-care professional. That said, I am guessing you have already seen this video in which Dr. Greger goes through the math of taking 2500 mcg/week of vitamin B12 http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheapest-source-of-vitamin-b12/ You can scale that up to 2500 mcg/day and see what’s what.Also, I did a quick google search on vitamin B12 and MS and this paper popped up: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1430153 If you rummage around Pubmed I’m sure there are others.Bottom line, if I were in your shoes I would follow your neurologist’s advice. There doesn’t seem to be a downside and the upside for you may be considerable. All the best and good luck!Hi Lawrence. Thanks a lot for your answer and links. That NIH paper is interesting. I actually see a specialized MS researcher there once a year and she hasn’t mentioned B12. At least she isn’t against vegan lifestyle and doesn’t push medication on me. I’m grateful for that and also for the excellent service at NIH. So I guess I will go with my non-NIH neurologist for the B12 dose. Thanks again and good luck to you too! OlgaHi Olga. We have not seen any research that says more B12 is better for MS. I agree with you, since there is no upper limit, taking more should be just fine. As Lawrence said I would listen to your doctor, as there may be an underlying reason we’re not aware why she or he is prescribing more B12. Here is a suggestion for the cheapest source of B12.Best to you, JosephDo I still need methylated B’s ESP folates (due to genetic polymorphism) if I also eat whole food veg? Also have ms. Ie will I get enough folates from diet without methylated supplements? (I know the science is not yet established in this area) Thanks !Folate deficiency is not a problem in vegetarian diet. The problem is vit B12 deficiency due to lack of plant sources. Although B12 and folate deficiency can both manifest the same in the beginning (megaloblastic anemia), and folate can correct this problem, the long term effect of B12 deficiency (neural degeneration) can not be corrected with only folates. Therefore vit B12 supplementation is necessary in vegetarian diet. This video is also another proof for it. I am not sure if you need more than usual folate if you are affected by MS. I hope previous comments would help you.Hi Veggy. It is best to listen to your doctor about any supplements needed for genetic polymorphisms. There is much conversation about MTHFR genetic defects in this video on folic acid.My information regarding impaired cognition is limited to medical school. I know there is no cure but progression can be slowed down with lifestyle changes. Very interesting that B12 can help with that. I was also surprised by the fact that vegetarians & vegans have high homocysteine levels. That in fact is not a bad side of vegetarian diet, but can emphasize the role of B12 supplements in revealing true benefits of vegetarian diet.Arent all B vitamines in seeds ,nuts end other nut-likes fruits and what we need is just to eat them, we need not any tbls and pulvis and any animal products. Is that correct ?B12 is a soil bacteria. Everyone on a plant-based diet needs to take B12, as well as anyone over 50, according to the Institute of Medicine.Something I saw this morning… Researchers “found no evidence of benefit for nervous system or cognitive function from 12 months of supplementation among older people with moderate vitamin B12 deficiency.” in recently published research. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/102/1/215.abstractThe conclusion said that there was a difference as long as there was sufficient omega 3 and B vitamins. You need both apparently. “The beneficial effect of B vitamin treatment on brain atrophy was observed only in subjects with high plasma ω-3 fatty acids.” “, B vitamin treatment slowed the mean atrophy rate by 40.0% compared with placebo”Would a high fruit/low vegetable diet not produce much homocysteine due to lower consumption of greens and folate?Hello, I recently got a concussion from a car rear ending us. This is my fourth head injury, what nutrition is good for healing the brain and surrounding tissue? I am taking one handful of walnuts a day, normally don’t take that many cause I need to keep the cholesterol down, any suggestions? Thank You.I am so sorry to hear about your injury. I am sure that this site would recommend less animal protein to reduce inflammation.Here’s a link you may find of benefit:http://www.brainline.org/content/2010/12/feed-your-body-feed-your-brain-nutritional-tips-to-speed-recovery.htmlThis website has a video on fighting inflammation with nuts as you have been doing:http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/Here’s an abstract from pubmed about how this is an area of research challenge:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19033220Hi Maria. Here is everything we have on brain health. Please let me know if any of these resources help? I am unfamiliar of any research on diet for concussions, but at any rate keeping our brains healthy and active are important regardless.It has been suggested elsewhere to avoid caffeine in all forms, anything stimulatory. Even tea and chocolate. It has also been suggested elsewhere to avoid any cooked fats, heated in any form. No white sugar, corn syrup, artificial anything.Thanks again Dr Greger for yet another informative, clear video on an important topic. Greatly appreciate your thoughtful, insightful clips – shared with a dose of humour. Does wonders for one’s health!Dr Greger’s sense of humor definitely helps ! I have been taking the B12 tablet (Cyanocobalamin) up until now, but will be trying the B12 drops (methylcobalamin) just to see if there is any noticeable difference. I was just wondering what constitutes “a drop” in medical terms? I sound fastidious but would like to get the dosage right.To share with your Portuguese speaking friends and family – http://nf.focoempatico.net/homocisteina-vitamina-b12-prevencao-perda-cerebral/Dr. Greger, What research is there on bioavailable Vitamin B12 levels in fermented foods such as natto?Haven’t seen any. From what I understand these are B12 analogs, look-a-likes, that mimic the cobalamin structure yet cannot be utilized. Jack Norris RD has loads of information about B12 that may be helpful. He mentions some of the studies that look at odd sources of B12.thx for the video post, I am wondering what kind of pills or [url=http://www.best-dietary-supplements.com/]supplement[/url] can increase my B12?the body naturally produces b12 from our beneficial bacteria in the gut. no need to supplement.","['aging', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'animal protein', 'b12', 'bacon', 'beans', 'bile acids', 'brain disease', 'brain health', 'breakfast', 'cognition', 'colon health', 'dementia', 'eggs', 'fiber', 'folate', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'greens', 'gut flora', 'Harvard', 'homocysteine', 'legumes', 'meat', 'memory', 'methionine', 'mortality', 'plant-based diets', 'steak', 'supplements', 'vegans', 'vegetables', 'vegetarians', 'vitamin B12', 'vitamin B6']","One week on a plant-based diet can significantly drop blood levels of homocysteine, a toxin associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.

I enjoy your daily 3 minute videos, and this hour long wrap up puts the big picture into place. I hope you can do more of them.I’m afraid once a year is about all I’m able to crank out of the hour-long summaries, btu I’m so glad you found it useful!I echo the appreciation for your work Dr. Greger.hi my grandmother is in da hospital for cancer and its all over when god pull her through dis wat cant she take toget betterHelloOutstanding! I am sharing this video, as I usually to, with my clients. Thank you once again for your work and your never ending humor. Best Audrey PellicanoThank you so much for sharing. That’s the reason my work is able to touch so many lives and so I can’t thank you enough.Has it already been a year! Time flies when you are having fun saving lives. I didn’t think you could top “Uprooting the leading causes of death” but you did, and I am grateful for it!Wow, that is high praise coming from you. I’m still not sure which one I like better. Uprooting was funnier, but I was hoping this one packed more of a punch.You are too kind! Anyway I like them both and yes Uprooting was funnier but I liked this time how you talked about “The Medical System” and that it is only for profit and their care is based on reimbursement! I think it is such an important point to put out there that I explain it at nearly every patient visit to show how the “sickness care system” works. It has been my experience that it helps get patients on board when they realize that the current system is about quantity of Patient visits, not quality of their care.Great job! If it wasn’t for you my job would be tremendously more difficult–and boring too. :-)I really love the emphasis on the harm done by the medical system and the emphasis on the real solutions. We watch the nightly news and every time they cover some “new technological breakthrough” for some “age related disease”, I end up going on quite a rant during the commercials.One of the last reports was about inserting tiny telescopes into people’s eyeballs for “age related” macular degeneration! Can you believe it?!Or when they talk about lack of access to “health”care being the reason for higher disease and death rates among certain demographics. Not the problem people!Your message is so important.To paraphrase Dwight Eisenhower – Beware the medical industrial complex.You bet I can believe the need for solutions to preserve at least some vision for people with age related macular degeneration. Do you want to give up your sight? Cover your eyes for a week and see how your work and home lives change!Hi Jennae, I don’t disagree with the development of treatments for disease; I am a cancer researcher and while I much prefer broccoli and berries for cancer prevention, if a loved one were diagnosed, I wouldn’t suggest only broccoli and berries. I would want them to get the traditional treatments as well.So my issue isn’t with r&d itself. My comment was a critique of both the media and the healthcare industry regarding specifically 1) the exclusion of the mountain of information we have regarding disease prevention and treatment through nutrition, and 2) continuing to label largely preventable diseases as “age-related” so that people can be sold first the idea that they are inevitable and incurable, and subsequently the treatments for them.I agree but I wouldn’t let the R & D industry off the hook either. We have talented researchers but they have to have funding to make a living. For those who have followed Dr. Greger’s work over the years you will notice that most of the good studies on primary and secondary prevention are coming out of Europe. I worked as a Chemical Engineer for two years at NIH before doing my clinical rotations in medical school. The number of institutes have grown over the years but there is not one devoted to the primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease. The US R & D industry needs a shift in focus which will only occur is the funding changes. The Hematology/Oncology specialty has done an excellent job at doing multi institutional studies to help determine the best treatments for cancer. We do need conventional therapy for cancers. I recommend that folks with cancers read Keith Block’s book, Life Beyond Cancer, for information about integrative cancer therapy. Some of the information is outdated but it gives good information for patients to work with their physicians.I understand the ranking of medicine as the third leading cause of death which was first pointed out in 2002. The numbers were based on extrapolations from studies in the state of Colorado and NY if my memory serves me correct. Unfortunately if we hold medicine accountable for not exposing our patients to the best science and developing systems that support the best choices you can make a credible case that we are the leading cause of death. Not to say we haven’t developed good drugs and procedures that are responsible for remarkable success stories. Health care professionals in my experience are hardworking and are trying to do the right things but they are trapped in a system which is dysfunctional by design.Uprooting was fantastically funny and informativeThank you so much! I really enjoyed the “Fun with FOIA” section from 17:45-25:30! As a government employee (currently enjoying my furlough day – the 20% pay cut not so much!), I am a big fan of the Freedom of Information Act. It keeps government clean and accountable – just like you do for food and pharmaceuticals. Thank you so much for your terrific work! Off to contribute to support your research and videos (furlough or no furlough!)Isn’t that just incredible? I’m with you–three cheers for transparency!Wahooo!! It’s like Christmas in July! Can’t wait to get home tonight to watch the whole thing!I’m so glad! Let me know what you think…Fantastic! Because of my research background I have this mental disease where I am unable to listen to, absorb, or share any information without primary sources (reviews are ok too). Because of that you just might be my favorite plant based doc! Neal Barnard is probably running a close second, especially after I learned he once adopted a rescue rat. Points for adorableness, it might not be fair, but it is what it is.Now commencing the spamming of family and friends! :DYou are the doctor of doctors !Dr. Greger- It’s a health and wellness FACT- you are saving lives, one 3 minute daily video at a time! THANK YOU for this hour of life giving information!Epic, Dr. Greger. Just epic. Any chance at having this video required viewing by everyone who takes office in D.C. and every medical student upon admission…and once again at graduation?This video is amazing. I needed this for a final push to get healthy. Do you recommend any books to read to help someone lead a vegan life? Thank you!The 21 day kickstart is a great place to start: http://www.21daykickstart.orgHeidi, also check out Dr. Esselystyn’s Prevent-Reverse Heart Disease book. You do NOT have to have heart disease to benefit.http://www.amazon.com/Prevent-Reverse-Heart-Disease-Nutrition-Based/dp/1583333002Also, the Fork and Knives video is very good.Neal Barnard, John McDougall, and Joel Furhman all have great books as well. If you read them all you’ll get slightly different perspectives on adopting a plant based diet, even though about 95% of what they say is the same. But for some people the emphasis on certain foods, or a lack of emphasis on any type of food, by one particular physician/researcher is easier or more enjoyable.Also Jeff Novick doesn’t have any books I believe, but his website is a great resource. He’s really good at breaking things down in terms of the math behind nutrition.Caldwell Esselstyn’s book (Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease) has easy, QUICK, delicious recipes. If you are into hearty, foods, you might go for Rip Esselstyn’s books (The Engine 2 Diet, and My Beef With Beef). I like Dr. Fuhrman’s books as well. If you are into cooking, try Isa Chandra Moskowitz’ Appetite for ReductionI love your videos. Between you and Dr Soram you have changed my life and my family! No more dairy, meat junk or processed foods. Lost 45 Lbs and feel great! All of your videos are fantastic! The best of all is your humor! This last video was great!Can someone please make a transcription of this great video? ThanksI second that request!!Wow. Dr. Greger, thank you so much. You always teach me so much, you always make me laugh, this time you made me cry (at the end of the video). You are still me hero : )LizzieGlad you’re touching on the methionine and cancer story (@ 38:20 in the video) here and and presumably in a future video. The methionine/cysteine ratio of proteins rather neatly explains why in TC Campbell’s work the milk protein casein (Met/Cys 7.7) was a potent cancer promoter, while soy protein (Met/Cys 1.2) was much less effective, as pointed out in this ambitiously titled short paper.And the animal protein with the lowest methionine/cysteine ratio? Human breast milk, at Met/Cys 0.8.I came across the whole methionine restriction story when following up some reading on calorie restriction. Who knew replacing high methionine meat with beans could account for about half the benefit of 40% calorie restriction diets.Wow, Darryl. It’s rare that someone points out a paper I’ve never seen before, but you did it! I’ve added it to my reading list. Thank you so much for the tip!Excellent message, Darryl. Thank you for taking the time to post this info on the methionine : cysteine ratio. I too had read about methionine while doing research about CR, but was unaware of this potential relationship with cysteine. And thanks to Dr Greger for bringing up the subject of methionine. I will likely owe the good doctor several years of my life, thanks to his efforts to promote a vegan, whole-foods diet.Dr. William Harris converted the USDA nutrient database into an easily sorted Excel spreadsheet, available here. I calculated some averages from all foods with greater than 1% protein by weight:Animal foods: methionine/total protein 2.58% methionine/cysteine 2.35Plant foods: methionine/total protein 1.39% methionine/cysteine 1.26Thanks for sharing the William Harris database…looks like an amazing resource for vegans!Now I don’t feel so bad about missing Summerfest this year. You are the highlight of the event in my opinion anyway. Well, you and…the food. Hahahaha!Fantastic – please can you get your video’s translated into other languages? ie Spanish xThank you Dr. Greger!!! You are one of reasons while I adopted a plant-based diet and continue to educate people about plants! Thank you for being standing up for us all!Absolutely fantastic video! I’ve been waiting for this and once again Dr. Greger exceeds all expectations! Nutritional yeast, mushrooms and flaxseeds have suddenly been added to or increased in my menu. And if at all possible, I’m going to be even more obnoxious about whole food plant based eating, since clearly friends don’t let friends eat meat!“friends don’t let friends eat meat!”I like that… :-)You cracked me up! Thanks for all your posts on this site.Don’t be too obscene, maybe we should start spelling it m3@t or me*t. LOL.As an additional comment:I think that you may be letting non-vegan accidents (attributable to the parasites in meat) off the hook: According to Flegr men testing positive to T. gondi antibodies (from eating undercooked lamb) have subtle behavioral differences, e.g., reflex impairment (supposedly manifested in double the car crash rates in statistical surveys of military personnel) and strangely an affinity for women with cats. http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/03/how-your-cat-is-making-you-crazy/308873/ In the life cycle of the parasite it infects rats who then lose their fear of wide open spaces, lose reflex time and develop a sexual arousal for cat urine (where normal rats have extreme trepidation), increasing the chances of being eaten by a cat to complete its life cycle. People blame cats for T Gondi, but the infection is more commonly acquired by undercooked meat consumption as Dr. Greger notes in another video where I have cross-posted. Although Flegr thinks the infection rate is quite high, if as few as just 10% are infected you could essentially hold meat consumption responsible for 10-20% (10% per normal plus 10% more) of car crashes; and if the statistic holds to other accidents, at least a portion of non-transportation related accidents. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3287140/Simply awesome, Dr. Greger! I too loved the humor as well as the content. This is very powerful information. Thanks for giving us another nice, big video.I think that video after video, Dear Doctor Greger you will change the life of thousands of men and women… Thanks for the great work you did!!Loved your energetic, humorous, and informative lecture at the Vegetarian Summerfest this year!!I love the video! I have just one question….what about just egg whites (omitting the yolk)? Are there still harmful components in the white…or is it mainly concentrated in the yolk?PS: On the topic of egg whites, Dr. Barnard wrote in his book on preventing and reversing diabetes, p. 49:“There are just two problems with eggs: the yolk and the white. The yolk is where cholesterol lurks, with 213 milligrams in a single yolk. That’s more than in an 8-ounce steak.The yolk also holds the fat, about 5 grams per egg.Egg white has problems of its own, since it is essentially pure animal protein. As you know by now, animal protein can present problems for your kidneys, and you are better off with plant protein.… Like all animal products, eggs have no fiber at all and no complex carbohydrate.”We know from here on Dr. Greger’s site and from Dr. Campbell’s book on The China Study, that animal protein has other problems than just affecting kidneys. There’s that IGF-1 boost which might be linked to cancer, etc.Also, to be complete, I’ll copy what Toxins has wrote in the past about egg whites. (Toxins is a frequent, and very knowledgable poster on NutritionFacts. I waited to see if he/she would answer you questions. Since that didn’t happen, I assume it is OK to repeat the text below as long as I give credit.)——————————– From Toxins: Here is some evidence of a major component of egg whites, Methionine, possibly causing human harm.1. Egg whites are high in the amino Acid Methionine. Rice has 14 times less of this amino acid and beans 7 time less. When one consumes Methionine in a large quantity (like that found in egg whites), it is broken down into sulfuric compounds. these sulfuric compounds are buffered by the calcium of the bones. the result, over time, is osteoporosis and kidney stones. http://www.vivalis.si/literatu…2. Cancer cell metabolism is dependent upon methionine being present in the diet; whereas normal cells can grow on a methionine-free diet feeding off other sulfur-containing amino acids. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu… http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu…3. Insulin like growth factor is raised significantly by Methionine. raised levels of IGF-1 = accelerated aging/tumor promotion. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu… http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org…4. Sulfur from Methionine is known to be toxic to the tissues of the intestine, and to have harmful effects on the human colon, even at low levels, possibly causing ulcerative colitis. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu… http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org…It seems the weight of evidence for even moderate use of eggs and egg whites is harmful despite what nutrients may be present. ———————- Hope that helps!Dr. Greger keeps piling on to the list of meat baddies and MIA’s. Woe to the simple enquirer asking why we don’t eat it; with harmane and methionine from the most excellent video here I have: parasites, live pathogens (including antibiotic-resistant strains), endotoxins (dead pathogens), saturated fat, trans fats (2-5% of fats in meat and dairy [and also in refined oils]), cholesterol, TMAO (inflammatory metabolite of choline/carnitine via the gut microbiota of regular meat eaters), harmane (essential tremorigenic), methionine, Neu5Gc (inflammatory red meat sugar), heme iron, nitrites, PAH’s and other cooked meat carcinogens (e.g., PhIP), putrescein (fish), added hormones, natural hormones (milk!), antiobiotics, IGF-1, concentrated environmental toxins (PCB’s, dioxin, mercury, cadmium, etc.). The MIA’s include fiber, prebiotics, phytonutrients!!!, potassium, nitrates . . . Really, how much more of this can decent society possibly take before the paradigm shifts?Great synopsis! This should be put on business cards to hand out when people ask.Poultry is a mainstay in my diet, yet hearing about the viral, antibiotic, fattening, bacterial, and other issues begs the question, “is poultry safe at any speed?” Specifically, which killers and sickeners will remain, if any, preparing chicken stock in an autoclave at 250 C, and discarding the fats and solids? (I’ve listened to your last two annual talks plus dozens of others today, so this question may seem a bit off topic.)Can I flip the question on you? Could you tell what exactly it is about the chicken stock that makes you want it enough that you would risk so much in terms of your health, not to mention go through the effort and cost of preparing it? (taste? some health benefit you believe it provides?) I ask because I get a powdered “chicken” flavor stock, which is composed entirely of dehydrated vegetables and herbs from my co-op, it tastes great, and all I have to do is add a tablespoon of it to each cup of water. If you prefer making your own stock from scratch, I’m sure you could find the proportions of herbs and veggies to get the same flavor to make it at home.I’ve been cooking most of my meals from scratch since about 1971 so effort and cost will be different to me. My question attempts to get at what ‘risk so much’ means under these cooking conditions. The result of a near complete flavor extraction of leeks, carrots, celery, and chicken for several hours with no vapor loss cannot be duplicated any other way, literally (plus the browning reaction occurs). 250 C for 2 hours eliminates bacteria & viruses, fats are completely rendered, and I don’t have a clue what happens to drugs under those conditions (plus who knows what else I’m missing). My kitchen is populated with a cooled centrifuge, precision water baths, high powered ultrasound, freezer that can reach minus 85 C and lots of other exotica I use to discover flavors, colors, and textures. Discovering ‘minimizing the baddies’ will be fun too.Regarding live bacteria, cooking and consumption is not the issue, it’s the preparation, so I would stock up on bleach. The study from this video didn’t discuss oncogenic viruses but I imagine those will be lurking around the kitchen as well. Regarding endotoxins, of course those are simply toxins, so they can not be killed. You will still have those as well. Regarding every other toxic substance present in a chicken… if you want to know what exactly happens to each one at particular temperatures (of course heat leads to the formation of additional toxins) I think you will have to do those experiments yourself. You don’t happen to have an nmr or a mass spec in the basement do you? I think for most the answer and alternative is just too simple: eat chickpeas instead :)My secret to making vegetable stock as richly flavored as chicken stock? Marmite (though residents of the nether regions of the world can substitute Vegemite). These autolyzed yeast extracts (which you’ve undoubtedly seen in ingredient listings) contribute free glutamate, which is the savory flavor the Japanese call umani, the same chemical present in chicken stock.Pressure cooking vegeble stocks also helps developing rich flavors with shorter cooking times and less energy use. I fill my pressure cooker about a third full with a mix of coarsely chopped onions, carrots, celery, garlic and a potato, sauté in just enough oil for about 15 minutes. Then I add some parsley, and some black peppercorns and thyme from the window-pot, and anything from the vegetable compartment about to turn but unlikely to impart a bitter flavor and the pièce de résistance, about a Tbsp of yeast extract spread per every 3 quarts. I fill nearly to the top and cook at pressure for 45 minutes and natural pressure release. Adjust seasoning and strain through mesh, freeze in icecube trays, and I’m set for stock for a month.My secret to making vegetable stock as richly flavored as chicken stock?

It’s on my shopping list. Umami flavor derives from glutamate(s) like salty does from salt(s) and sweet from sugar(s), etc.I am an omnivore considering becoming a semi-vegetarian so my newly discovered umami superfood, Red Boat fish sauce, will probably continue in my pantry.My question attempts to discover what will remain after super heating (at least by kitchen standards) chicken. Liquid temperature of 250 C isn’t trivial in the kitchen inducing the Maillard reaction (browning) and possible protein denaturing, etc. that won’t happen in a pressure cooker. Hygiene and cross contamination aside, biological agents other than prions deactivate.What happens to organic undesirables like added hormones and antibiotics; do new and bad chemical species appear; do fat-soluble compounds follow the bones and fat into the trash; can I ameliorate the undesirables in poultry knowing poultry has problems and will stay in my diet nonetheless?By way of background, I was conceived of lucky sperm and have a waist/height ratio of 31/70; BMI hovering between 20 and 21 for 43 years; total lipids less than 165 mg/dl; blood pressure 128/70; eyes OK; hearing better; etc – all while never, ever giving a second thought to limiting my diet by anything other than what pleases me. Freakish to be sure, and greatly tempered by no attraction to fast or processed foods over time.Dr. Greger convincingly makes the case for veganism considering health alone, so cutting back thoughtfully (by say 90%) on meat products is worthwhile. Culinary pleasure is also a consideration for many, including me. Dying with a rib bone in my mouth is a possibility I accept without regret. I hope to discover my personal balance and maybe share solutions with others not yet fully enamored of the plant/fungus-only diet, and hoping to find yet more answers through Dr. Greger’s universe.Whilst trying to work today in the doctor’s office, I couldn’t help overhearing my colleagues (surgeons in fact) scoffing at vegetarians “What do I care if my chicken was grown in a cage? It exists to feed me!”, ” When I’m out with a pious vegetarian I like to order the meatiest thing on the menu just to wind them up!” – I think the UK is even further behind than the US when it comes to the medical profession’s awareness of advances in preventative medicine – and we have a national health service! I quote you Dr Greger to them on a daily basis and it raises a lot of eyebrows I can tell you!That’s great that you’re raising those eyebrows! Especially given the environment you’ve described. It’s amazing how much effort some people will put into trying to offend a vegan isn’t it? Really speaks volumes about them (and their subconscious discomfort with their own diet I think).Oh yes. People want to hear good things about their bad habits :)You are so entertaining and informative. You are truly a gem. We are so lucky to have found you!Thank you Dr. Greger! The Philippines would be so much healthier if doctors and health educators here would just watch and listen to your videos (and apply the things they learn of course…). I am definitely sharing this info to my patients and my colleagues! Can’t wait to meet you in person this October for the Lifestyle Medicine conference in Washington D.C. God bless!Thank you so much. You are a great human being.Wow, wonderful vid! I’m sharing with lots of people, God bless.I loved this video and your last one too. Thank you for explaining so well what our diet does to us.Excellent. Your best annual summary yet IMO. Love the humor – has it been “banned in Boston”? I’ll be sharing this far and wide. Thank you another informative and fun video.You may never see an advertisement for broccoli itself. But there are many ads for vegetables on TV. And contrary to Dr Greger’s statement here, broccoli is grown for a profit. Its farmers, distributors, and grocery vendors are all for-profit businesses, and there are profits in broccoli.Most reasonable people are not going to interpret Dr. Greger’s statement as saying “absolutely $0.00 in profits are made from broccoli and absolutely $0.00 is spent on advertising it”.We’re talking about the numbers spent on advertising vegetables, compared to the numbers spent on meat, dairy, and eggs. If you compare these you will see that in the context of overall spending, the amount spent on broccoli and other vegetables is essentially negligible.Certainly the profits from broccoli could be increased if more people bought it, but more people won’t buy it, because currently the advertising dollars are overwhelmingly dominated by meat, dairy and eggs, with those advertisers desperately trying to insinuate that their products are “healthy and nutritious”.And if people ate more broccoli instead of animal foods, not only would the meat, dairy, and egg industries suffer a loss, but the medical establishment as it now stands (based on pills and procedures), medical supplies distributors, and pharmaceutical companies would suffer as well. So the profits made from broccoli are also negligible compared to profits associated with the unhealthy foods Dr. Greger is discussing.Wow, this was amazing! I think this was funnier than last year’s lecture (or at least definitely had more puns). I love the great work you do to educate people about this. Understanding the science behind how nutrition works is important, but its also important to understand who profits from having a system that goes against all knowledge and logic. . And a video showing how disfunctional the medical industry is demonstrates this perfectly, as do the egg industry’s exchanges wohh the USDA.. thank you so much for bringing this priceless information to us in such an understandable way!Very good presentation! Thanks again for this excellent learning resource.This was a fantastic and informative presentation. can I buy a DVD and screen it publicly? Uprooting The Cause of Death was popular at a recent movie nightHeidi: Here’s the link for buying this latest DVD (plus others!):http://www.drgreger.org/DVDs/Incredible message. I lost my wife of 42 years to esophageal cancer this May. I wish I had known what to do for her 2 1/2 years ago when she was first diagnosed. She may have survived. I am just finishing paying the over 10K EUR in hospital bills, for hospital care that was meant to be helpful, healing, but only caused her more pain and agony during the operations, radiation, chemo, and medications that she took daily. I miss her terribly. Please keep doing what you are doing, Dr. Greger. Thank you,Rick SidleyAs always, your video is interesting, informative, and cleverly funny. I plan to share it on my blog, like I do with many of your shorts.ThanksI absolutely loved this video! (and all of your programs!) Thanks to you and Dr. Joel Fuhrman, and Victoria Moran, I am having a blast in my first year as a full fledged vegan…Ann: Thanks for mentioning Victoria Moran. I was aware of the other people you mentioned, but I hadn’t heard of Victoria before. I checked her out a bit and like what I saw.If you find yourself wanting more inspiration at some point, you may want to check out Dr. Barnard’s work and the stuff over at PCRM (Physician’s Committee For Responsible Medicine).———————–I hope the rest of your first year and many years to come continue to be a blast! What a great attitude. Thanks for sharing it.Those last 2-3 minutes are POWERFUL!That is what I’m trying to get my family to understand – it pains me to think of my ‘getting older’ parents suffering from heart disease, cancer, etc. – but they’re dancing with the devil, and I’m going to be the one to have to sit by and watch when all I can think about is how EASY and SIMPLE and CHEAP it is to prevent in the first place! I’m healthy, 31 years old, eat a whole food, plant-based diet, get regular exercise, and have a positive outlook on life. I am ECSTATIC about the long, healthy, happy life I have ahead of me! It is so empowering to be in control of my destiny.Fantastic lecture, Dr. Greger. I really enjoyed watching it – thanks for putting it together and sharing with everyone!I really enjoyed this talk!!! Thank you for every effort you are making in order to bring this knowledge to surface so it can be available to all! As a newly graduated nurse practitioner, I could not believe we had no training on nutrition. So I took a 12 weeks nutrition program and became vegan 4 months ago. I did it for my own health, for my patients’ health, for animal ethics and environmental sustainability. Keep up the great work and humor! :)Thank you for this video. I wish the world had more doctors like you, ones who illuminate and empower people to better themselves, rather than relying on faceless meat/dairy and drug companies to tell them how to be “healthy.”this is fantastic!!!!Dr. Greger you are the king.Your presentation is so good… I think you are so blessed because when you speak on those subjects many negative feelings of many people just disappears.When i speak on those subjects i get a full range of negative ideas. (and my profession is to speak so … wow… you are so great)I would like to ask you about been a semi-vegan. like eating a meat once a month. i am a 100% vegan for almost a month and i read in your website that this require eating supplements.Please please tell me what you think about that? this is a real subject that need to be address i think :)So fantastic that you’re cleaning up your diet! I do recommmend that you start taking vitamin B12 supplements. This video: Safest Source of B12 and this blog Vegan B12 Deficiency: Putting It Into Perspective describe in more detail. So glad I can help!In health, Michaelshahar klamka: Just in case Dr. Greger doesn’t have time to reply, I have some thoughts I hope will be helpful to you. I’ll share in 2 parts.Part 1: I believe your first question is one that many other people share. I believe your question is: what exact (while understandably small) percentage of your diet can be meat and yet still be healthy? While we can take some educated guesses, I don’t think we have a definitive answer for that. And that’s why, in my opinion, if you look at Dr. Greger’s Optimal Nutrition Recommendations, you saw that he does not include any animal products in his recommendations.Put another way: We do know that eating a whole plant food diet, with B12 supplementation, will be healthy, all else being equal. If you choose to eat some processed foods or meat or dairy once a month, who knows? My gut feeling says if you are truly only having a small amount of meat once a month and the rest is whole plant foods with B12 supplement, you are probably fine health-wise. If nothing else, your diet is so far ahead of so many other people’s diet, you should be proud of where you are on your path to healthy eating. But at the same time, you should treat that meat eating the same way you would treat eating ice cream or candy. Not good for you. You may do it from time to time (I still eat chocolate!), but don’t fool yourself into thinking it is part of a healthy diet. Instead think: This is a treat that I haven’t weaned yourself from *yet* on my path to healthy eating.Part 2: But I don’t think that is all of your question. I believe the full question centers around this idea: If eating a whole plant food diet “requires supplementation”, how is that healthy? Would eating meat once a month mean that you don’t need to supplement? At least, that’s what I think you are asking.I highly recommend that you check out Dr. Greger’s videos and articles on B12. You will see that the B12 recommendation has more to do with fixing the “problems” of our modern word, like clean water and food, than it is about fixing a problem with the vegan diet. It is true that you could get some B12 from eating meat, but everyone over 50 years old, ***regardless of their diet*** is supposed to supplement B12. Plus: don’t forget that food is a package deal. So, if you decided to get your B12 from meat or dairy, you would be getting it in a very risky manner. Supplementing is much safer. Plus, if you were only eating meat once a month, I don’t know if that would be enough to get all the B12 you needed.Dr. Greger’s recommendations on vitamin D follow a similar logic. It’s more about fixing the problems with our modern world (going around clothed all day, and away from the equator too) than about fixing the vegan diet. In other words, vitamin D deficiency is generally a sun-deficiency. It has little to do with diet one way or the other. (Though be sure to check out Dr. Greger’s videos on mushrooms and vitamin D for some fascinating info. if you want your vitamin D from food.)Taking a look at the bigger population: Dr. Greger has another video where he shows that the typical omnivore (in America?) has far more nutritional deficiencies than the typical vegan. That’s because animal products have so little nutrition compared to whole plant foods.My personal bottom line is: If your concern is eating a diet that is most likely to provide all the nutrition you need, then the whole plant food diet is undeniably the way to go.I hope these thoughts are helpful to someone!Thank you! Will share frequently, just like I do with “Uprooting the leading causes of death”. <3beautiful, thank you so muchLove it Dr. Greger! Keep up the great job!I have thinned out a lot of crowds with The Lose Weight Songhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMhkUM8Yu7EA fabulous presentation which I sent to my friends. But I feel that I must include a warning to ignore your outmoded ideas on certain points. I am amazed that you still cling to the mistaken idea that saturated fat is the cause , and not just a symptom of cardiovascular disease. Please read again:http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2010/01/13/ajcn.2009.27725.full.pdf+htmlIt seems clear that a mistake was made when saturated fat was blamed for the gumming up of arteries. The cholesterol found there is not the cause but the effect as the body tries to deal with the damage. Dr Greger, PLEASE open your mind to the possibility that Dr. Keys made a mistake which has led us down a wrong path.Please expand on this a bit further. Is it that saturated fat doesn’t cause cholesterol, or that cholesterol doesn’t cause clogged arteries?As the link shows, cardiovascular disease is not correlated with high cholesterol. This mistaken idea has been kept alive by the $29 billion Statin industry. A 2009 UCLA study of 137000 people hospitalized for heart attacks found that they didn’t have high cholesterol. Here is the link:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19081406This study should have put an end to the cholesterol nonsense but its author was a contractor for Phizer and Glaxo spun the results to mean that we must try for even lower levels of cholesterol. The official target was lowered by a committee of big pharma contractors and the result was a eight billion dollar increase in statin sales.Here is a link:http://dietheartnews.com/2012/02/low-cholesterol-associated-with-75-percent-of-all-heart-attacks/ http://dietheartpublishing.com/Cholesterol/10/09Cholesterol is deposited in damaged arteries but is not the cause of the damage.Uffe Ravnskov wrote an excellent book called “Ignore the Awkward” that tells the story of the massive mistake of Dr Ansel Keys that started this mess and the denial and coverup that has kept it alive.Great presentation Dr. Greger! I thought the part on heart disease was really interesting. I was wondering if I can still eat wallnuts and reverse heart disease? or do wallnuts contain too much saturated fat…Dr. Greger, just out of curiosity, at 13:07 you show the cholesterol level of africans and asians in Uganda, why do the asians have such high cholesterol?! And why do the african cholesterol rates go down as they get older? Thanks for the presentation.Dr. G, You have done it again! I LOVED watching and learning from this longer video. I watched/listened to it while preparing an array of PB foods. And, with each slice and dice of my knife, I keep thinking how powerful and nutritious the food I was preparing will be for my family.Your detailed and easy to understand explanations (I did not study the hard sciences) help me to visualize how these healthy foods make my body stronger, cleaner, and more resilient with each bite I take.I have learned SO much from you over the years (and to think, that I stumbled upon you on some random website on vegan cooking). You have enlightened me and there is no turning back.THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart for what you have done and continue to do for public health. For all you have done, you deserve a Noble Food Prize!wow, this is so great!Dr. Greger great presentation! Is it possible to reverse heart disease while eating walnuts or do they contain to much fat?Panagis Stathatos: Dr. Greger has some videos and I believe one blog post on this topic. I don’t have the links handy, but hopefully you can find them using the search box. Good luck.So enlightening. Thank you for sharing this…I just wanted to personally thank you for providing such a positive light for nutrition advocate in medical academia. I am currently a first year medical student at a school down here in Florida and I suffer the chronic struggle of trying to “prove” to my colleagues the benefits of a plant based diet. What you offer me is an epidemiological basis for all my arguments that cannot be overlooked! You are a saint as far as Im concerned and are saving lives every single day. Thank you so much for spending your time to make it easier for people like me to get my point across!Thank you very much for power full information I suffer from skin disorder I want to try what I learnt from knowledge, all we eat has to be organic or what ever we can afford ? Thank againzadkan: Dr. Greger has a great blog on here (somewhere) where he answers this question with some great stats. The bottom line was that you are better off eating a bunch of fruit and veggies even if they are not organic. However, eating organic when you can is definitely better.I recommend that you search on line for a list of what they call the “Dirty Dozen”. This is a list of the 12 worst fruits and veggies concerning pesticides – even after the foods are washed. So, some people’s rule of thumb is: at least eat these foods organic. The same group produces a list of “clean” foods which shows you the foods with the least pesticides. So, if you can’t find organic with those foods, you might feel better about that. Finally, I’ll point out that the group that produces the “Dirty Dozen” list updates the list every year because farmers’ practices change. So, be sure to check back from time to time.I’m sorry to hear about your skin condition. While a healthy diet is not a guarantee of anything, it can’t hurt and has great potential to help a large number of problems. I recommend that you find Dr. Greger’s blog with his “Optimal Nutrition Recommendation” and do a search on skin conditions/your particular condition. I know that Dr. Greger has addressed at least one skin issue in one of his every-day, smaller specific-topic videos.Best of luck to you. I hope this helps.Hi zadkan,I started getting little patches of psoriasis in my early twenties, as well as what I believe now was arthritis; I do believe my healthy (whole foods plant based) diet has reversed it and perhaps prevented it from getting worse (I guess I’ll never know… and I’m fine with that!). While I always eat vegan, at times when I have fell off the whole foods healthy eating wagon, eating lots of sugary and fatty foods, I immediately see the consequences of the little patches on my arms, and it will take a few weeks of healthy clean eating to for it to fade away. So I’m not sure what exactly your condition is, or if it is autoimmune related (I have a family history of autoimmune conditions), but at least for some skin conditions a whole foods plant based diet (*not* just vegan) is definitely worth a try.As far as cost, you can eat extremely healthy on a very limited budget, especially if you keep a few tricks in mind:1) You can save a lot of money by increasing the ratio of grains and beans to vegetables in your diet, since grains and beans, even organic, when bought in bulk are usually dirt cheap. Things like organic lentils or rice might cost $0.15/serving or even less.2) Do you have a local co-op? At ours, all of the prepackaged “health” foods are super expensive, but almost all of the produce and bulk grains/beans are organic, and either the same cost or cheaper than the regular grocery store.3) Frozen vegetables – already frozen veggies are incredibly cheap. Organic ones cost a little more but probably still less than fresh. Or you can keep an eye on weekly sales and buy whatever fresh organic produce is on sale at the moment and freeze it yourself.4) Don’t get too bogged down on eating tons of “superfoods”, if they seem out of your budget. All plants are superfoods, and as Dr. Greger says, the best vegetable/fruit/plant is the one you eat.Dr. Greger, Instead of asking doctors to recommend a plant based diet to patients with disease, would it not be better to approach the insurance companies. I am sure they would like to cut their costs and we could have lower insurance premiums as well as healthier people!. It’s a win win.My friend, you are a national treasure. There is no better ongoing source of nutritional advice.Based on your advice, I am studying Plant Based Nutrition through Cornell.Rick KartesHi Dr. Greger, Another great presentation! Thank you so much for all this important information. Do you give lectures around the world? Is it possible to invite you to speak in Israel?Thanks a lot! Eyal.Dr. Greger,Thanks for all of your great videos.Three questions:1) Where did you do your residency?2) Are you board-certified?3) Which charities do you donate the proceeds of your books, videos, etc. to?Thanks for you interest in my work! To answer your questions:1. All my post-graduate medical work was done at Lemuel Shattuck, a Tufts hospital in Boston (sadly the only public health hospital left after a few republican gubernatorial terms). They had a maximum security prison unit, one of the last locked TB wards, and a homeless shelter on the grounds. Sadly it was like practicing 3rd world medicine right here in the U.S.2. No board certification yet in lifestyle medicine, but the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (of which I’m a proud member) is working on it! (http://www.lifestylemedicine.org/ACLM)3. I used to donate to a different charity every month, but now that I started a 501(c)3 nonprofit charity to keep NutritionFacts.org afloat, all my proceeds from all my books, DVDs, and presentations goes straight to keep the website up and running (I receive no salary or any renumeration from the site). If you’d like to chip in as well, you can support my work at https://nutritionfacts.org/donate/4. My favorite color: green5. Turn-ons: kale:)Thank you!Dr. G…..Your presentations are fantastic. I share them daily on FB. Thank you for the research based informationIt’s so obvious. Why has is taken you a lifetime to discover this? Our food has ALWAYS been our medicine! The trouble is, the medical profession has always been obsessed with finding CURES, and every time someone like you discovers that a particular nutrient helps with something particular, it is always put out as some kind of scientific “breakthrough”. Codswallop! Billions have been spent on scientific research into food for NO JUSTIFIABLE REASON. Cellular Nutrition is the way forward, combined with a natural method of cleansing the colon so that the Villi can return to their optimal working level and absorb our food efficiently. The trouble these days is that people think they can eat just anything because someone will give them a pill to make them better!Dr. Gregor, is yeast safe for people who have yeast issues?In your videos you talk a lot about the dangers of saturated fats, but recently the net is buzzing with information about how there isn’t a link between CHD and saturated fats. I have several “fat-Taliban” in my vicinity and would find it very interesting if you could expand on this subject a little.Also, a bit about the “low carb” craze that’s going on would be very interesting, as it seems to attract quite a lot of followers.I found your video “Uprooting the leading causes of death” last year and it changed my life. Thanks for that. I visit your site almost daily now, both for your videos and for the high quality comments that accompany them, both by yourself and other members of this community.A powerful presentation that should be shown everywhere. Thank you, as always, Dr. Greger.A great way to put all the seasons’ fresh vegetables to good use. Alter the ingredients with whatever veggies you picked up from the farmer’s market or were included in your CSA.Field to Bowl Chili– 4 cups cooked green lentils – 1 cup water/homemade vegetable broth – 3 medium beets, cubed – 3-5 small turnips, cubed – 3 small carrots, diced – 1 zucchini, diced – 1 summer squash, diced – 1 onion, chopped – 3 large tomatoes, chopped – 1 green pepper, diced – 1 hot pepper, minced – 4-7 cloves garlic, minced – handful fresh cilantro, chopped – black pepper – sea salt – nutritional yeastCrush and mince garlic then set aside. Add water, beets, turnips, carrots, onion, zucchini, and squash to a large soup pot and cook over medium heat for 5-10 minutes. Turn heat to low and cook another 10-15 minutes. Add remainder of ingredients except nutritional yeast and cook until all vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with sea salt and black and pepper. Top each individual serving with a tablespoon nutritional yeast.~Complements of lovestobeveganwhat about the link between MS and sunlight/vitamin D? does this have a statistically significant relationship?Dr. Greger, Six months ago I was facing yet another stenting ‘procedure’, after a heart attack, Quad-bypass, two stenting procedures (5 stents total). I was suffering, intensely, from every side effect that comes with statin drugs including dementia and muscle wasting and cramping, popping Nitro like candy just to get through the day, 30 pounds overweight, and, in candor, mentally getting my final business in order. Six months ago I chose to stop statin drugs and become an Uber-Vegan. This decision was after extensive research and information gathering about statin drugs and ways to live without them. Operative word here is LIVE – not exist. The information that you have offered, along with several others, was instrumental for an educated decision to take my sojourn into a new life. Today, at 64, I am off all medications, my cholesterol is 155, results of my latest Nuclear stress test shows no indications of blockages, 34 pounds lighter – from 192lbs to 158lbs (from a snug 38″ waist to a comfortable 30″), briskly walking 3+ miles a day, mentally sharp, and looking forward to a longer and healthier life. Wishing to share this option to others in my predicament, I am working on a project in which your information would be important to reference. If you would, Doctor, please PM me at ronzet@hotmail.com to let me know if it is possible and if you would be willing to discuss this project with me. At your service, Ron ZWow! What a fantastically inspirational story! Congratulations to you @badcellist! Amazing!WholeFoodsChomper, Thank you. I wake up every morning feeling GREAT and bounding out of bed. I truly feel 20 years younger – just wish I looked 20 years younger :-) ZFantastic! Ugh, our ageist youth-oriented culture really does a number on us, doesn’t it? I bet you look great just the way you are. Each age has its value and its beauty. Celebrate and flaunt it!A concerned Vegan…Dr. Greger,I am absolutely Vegan – even to a point of no sugar, no white flour, a trace of oils – and have been for 6 months…However, I just had a lipid panel completed and my Cholesterol is a whopping total of 222 – LDL 125 – HDL 85 – and triglycerids 61. I do have an elevated Thyroid level at 3.2 (desired range 0.3-3.0).I walk 6+ miles a day and spend an hour in the gym.   Is there any reason to be concerned over these numbers? Does an elevated Thyroid have an affect on Cholesterol levels? Is there anything else I should be doing to reduce my cholesterol?I love your site and watch your videos constantly –Thank you for the work that you do and the information that you provide to we who do not trust in the medical industry’s current philosophy – “Don’t Cure Disease, Treat It. No money in curing disease”.MaryHi, Mary. You ask some good questions that I’d be curious about getting answers to as well. I am also hypothyroid (I have Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis), and my doc has told me that individuals with thyroid issues do need to pay close attention to heart issues. I looked into it and the Mayo Clinic says the following re hypothroidism and heart problems:“Hypothyroidism may also be associated with an increased risk of heart disease, primarily because high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the “bad” cholesterol — can occur in people with an underactive thyroid. Even subclinical hypothyroidism, a more benign condition than true hypothyroidism, can cause an increase in total cholesterol levels and impair the pumping ability of your heart. Hypothyroidism can also lead to an enlarged heart and heart failure.”Please do post more, if you learn more or get any updates on the matter.I’m curious, do you eat nuts?WholeFoodChomper,Thank you for the reply.I take thyroid medications but have self reduced the dose. Perhaps this has had some affect on my Cholesterol levels.With this lipid panel results, I will move my dosage back up. I just wish that being Vegan would cure the Hypo and Hyper thyroid problems.I do eat nuts, quite a bit actually. Walnuts, Almonds, etc. since they provide a healthy fat to my diet.Thanks again. Mary“I just wish that being Vegan would cure the Hypo and Hyper thyroid problems.” Boy, do I second that! Alas, I think, at this point anyway, thyroid related conditions are something to be managed, but not cured. Much to my dismay.You may want to check out what Dr. McDougall has to say about thyroids: http://www.drmcdougall.com/video/mcdougalls_moments_thyroid.html It’s pretty basic info, but I still found it helpful to hear.I’m not sure if your thyroid issue is connected to an autoimmune issue, like mine is, but I wonder if the findings related to diet and MS might be applicable to the thyroid as well. Dr. McDougall has a good write up on the MS issue featuring Dr. Swank (mentioned in the above NF video): http://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2009nl/jan/ms.htmI eat nuts, too. But, I’m wondering if I need/should cut down on that. The Swank Diet focuses on drastically reducing saturated fats and some nuts have relatively high levels of saturated fat, which might possibly have an effect on cholesterol levels. Reducing or eliminating some of your nut intake might be something worth experimenting with in your particular situation.The Mayo clinic has some neat info about nuts: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nuts/HB00085/NSECTIONGROUP=2 , as, of course, does this site.Trying cutting down your nut intake to 1 oz of walnuts only. Cut down on sodium intake as well. To really understand this issue we have to understand all aspects of your diet, as in what the base of your meals are and what you commonly eat.thank you so much!!! what an amazing presentation. i was laughing, crying, in shock of this world, u got it all in there and it sure gives inspiration to eat healthier and share this with all our surroundings! hopefully all health ministers around the world will see this!!!Have shared this and will continue to do so, as there is so much misinformation ‘for profit’ out there!THE PERFECT DIETN.B: FAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MACRONUTRIENTIf you are overweight, pre-diabetic or diabetic, or not running on eight cylinders, you may be a victim of carbohydrate poisoning! The most killing diseases facing us today – including obesity – are a result of the overemphasis on carbohydrates. This can be corrected by grading and restricting carbohydrates – and emphasizing natural dietary fat and complete animal protein.Food is our fuel. Much depends on what we choose to eat. How long and how well we live depends on how we “fuel” our brain, heart, hormones, kidneys, liver, lungs, skin and bones. Human cells, tissues, and organs function optimally if they are provided what they need when they need it.It’s easy to argue that fat is the most important macronutrient. Our 70 trillion cells are protected by two layers of fat: lipid bilayers. Along with protein and water, fat – much of it saturated – is what our bodies are made of. Though included in our diets, carbohydrates should be chosen carefully and restricted in order to keep blood sugar in a narrow healthy range.For most people, carbohydrates should be restricted to about 60 grams daily, depending on any illness that may be present, or a consideration for a person’s environmental conditions. (A lumberjack will eat more than a tailor.) The body will more easily maintain itself and regenerate health if carbohydrates do not overwhelm hormone systems that keep blood sugar under tight optimum control.Carbohydrates (carbs) are sugars by another name. Carbohydrates are abundant in fruits, vegetables and grains – in boxed cereals – and in all floury or sweet packaged products. Remember, in the gut, even healthy-sounding broccoli, cauliflower,and zucchini turn into glucose (blood sugar). Our biological requirement for carbohydrates is: Zero.Some foods are a combination of the three macronutrients. As an example, milk contains fat, protein, and carbohydrate. There is protein in many foods (beans, corn, grains, mushrooms, peas, seeds and nuts) but only animal foods (chicken, cheese, eggs, fish, organ meat, pork, and red meat) provide complete high value protein. (Egg white is pure protein.)The Perfect Diet emphasizes complete animal protein for the maintenance and regeneration of the body and high octane fats to provide energy for – among other things – the digestion and assimilation of protein. The Perfect Diet is not a high protein diet; it’s a high fat diet that offers strength and energy and it’s simple to follow.The first meal of the day should include fat and protein – about 30 grams of protein before noon. Good quality eggs – 7 grams of protein each – provide high value protein and many other key nutrients (choline). If you eat a 3 or 4 egg omelet before noon, you may not be hungry until dinner. If you eat high value foods, you may not need to eat as much.As our main fuel, we must choose between fats and carbohydrates. Emphasizing two fuels is a mistake. Our bodies react adversely to “mixing fuels.” Since fats are energy and nutrient dense – and don’t raise blood sugar – they will more fully provide satiety and satisfy the energy needs of the body.(In the Perfect Diet, there is no need for routine snacking or eating more than two meals a day. Eating many small meals a day will result in the digestive organs getting no rest which can lead to a variety of digestive tract ailments.)On the Perfect Diet, we will cut carbs – not calories. Depending on your circumstances, you can eat up to 3,000 or more calories a day but you will still burn fat. You can pretty much live on steak, chicken, and green salads. For breakfast you can eat as many eggs as you like – and bacon too. You can put full fat dressing on your salads and butter on your steak.Our bodies evolved to run optimally on a diet emphasizing protein and natural fat, eggs, fish, and meat. We are suffering today because we are eating a diet dominated by carbohydrates; and a high percentage have been milled and refined. The basis of the Perfect Diet is restricting the macronutrient (carbohydrate) associated with a metabolic disturbance that causes weight gain, hunger, diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome, and heart disease.This diet can work for you. It’s easy to follow and you can eat as much as you want; you’ll never go hungry. Dietary abundance goes hand-in-hand with feeling on top of the world. If you need to, you’ll lose inches as well as pounds. When you burn fat as a fuel you are moving in the direction of health, stabilized blood sugar, lower triglycerides, increased HDL, and energy throughout the day.Here are the Paleo Principles:1. Eat foods that sustained human beings before we wrecked our health by becoming settled, citified farmers. Eat meat, fish, eggs, avocados, leafy vegetables, preferably fermented (sauerkraut) or steamed and berries, nuts, wild seeds.2. Eat foods raised in accordance with their own natural environment. The animals you eat should eat grass if they have four stomachs. The birds you eat should eat worms, bugs and weeds. The plants you eat should be grown in soil that does not require pesticides and herbicides.3. Eat foods that are like a stick of nutritional dynamite, instead of like a wimpy little firecracker. Everything you eat should provide your body with a concentrated source of nutrients for maintaining, building, repairing and fueling your body. A bowl of rice is a wimpy firecracker. A piece of grass-raised beef is dynamite.4. Eat your carbohydrate in accordance with your energy expenditure. Carbohydrate only has one function in the human body: to provide energy. If you are primarily sedentary at work or at your computer, then don’t eat carbohydrates. All they do is give you a SUGAR spike.5. Prepare your foods the way that humans have traditionally prepared foods. Certain foods require specific handling methods in order to make their limited nutrients bioavailable to the human body.6. Don’t eat things that aren’t food. Food should be easily identifiable. Soy milk, protein bars and sports drinks are a far cry from any food that exists in the natural world. Better nutrition through chemistry is A BAD IDEA.7. Eat a wide range of traditional, life-giving FATS that have not been damaged by processing. Your body can use FATS to make nearly all that it needs to survive, along with water.8. Eat foods that are rich in lacto-bacteria to replenish the micro-organisms of our gut.9. Eat some of your foods raw including animal foods or slightly cooked i.e., liver. Nutrient content and bioavailability of food is affected by preservation and cooking method.10. Do not partition your food wastefully. If you are eating an egg, eat the whole egg. If you are eating an animal, eat the organs, muscles and bones.11. Get to know your food supply. Know your hunters, your butchers, your gatherers, your storekeepers and your farmers. Know what foods are produced in your own geographic environment.12. Know yourself. How do you feel, perform and look? If the way you feel, perform or look isn’t top level, change something about the way you eat, move and care for yourself!!!The Low DownThe human body is a metabolic marvel comprised of dozens of little systems connecting to create one complex system. Food is the fuel, the input, for the systems. Our metabolic machinery evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to function optimally on select fuels. These fuels were the original, Primal foods of the human organism. Over these hundreds of thousands of years our Big Game Hunting, small prey capturing, scavenging, foraging, gathering, opportunistic ancestors accumulated experience and wisdom about nourishing themselves. They learned to preserve and predigest foods to maximize the quality of their metabolic fuel. Eventually they learned to cook foods without destroying the important nourishing properties of the food, and then they learned to heal the human body with food.Only recently in the human evolutionary experience, have we abandoned all these hundreds of thousands of years of accumulated epicurean genius.Today we fuel our marvelous, complex metabolic machinery with crap invented to create profits for agribusiness.We have become dumb eaters.As we regain our eating intelligence it doesn’t make sense to move back to the savannah and put out our fires or climb into our cave and pretend there is a glacier next door. It makes sense to fuel our bodies with all the primal human foodstuffs, prepared and preserved with accumulated ancestral wisdom and served up for the undeniable desires of the human taste buds. Primal, paleolithic food choices, handled according to ancient food ways resulting in outrageously good food.Human beings do not have a biological requirement for carbohydrate.We can survive just fine without carbohydrate. Many people have done it, entire cultures have done it, and you could too if you wanted. You probably don’t, so it makes sense to learn how to eat carbohydrates in a way that they will help you instead of harming you.Carbohydrate is a one-trick pony in terms of your metabolic requirements. It is solely used to produce energy for you. When you eat carbohydrate in excess of what you need for energy production you will store it as body fat because there is NOTHING else for your body to do with it!! Your body can’t use it to grow your bones or repair your muscles or produce hormones. The best thing you can get from your carbohydrates, since our modern life really doesn’t require all that much physical energy, are their associated micronutrients.Give your carbohydrates a long hard look and be ruthless in your assessment of what good they do you. Are they packed with minerals? Are they loaded with phytonutrients? Are they brimming with antioxidants? Are they dripping with water-soluble vitamins? Use the carbohydrates in your diet to flood your body with real, whole food sources of critical nutrients.It is easy to line up your carbohydrates and pick the very best ones. If you pour a cup of water onto your carbohydrate will it be cleaner? Or will it turn into mush? If you pour water on fruits or vegetables they are more ready to eat!!! If you pour water onto flour, cereal, crackers, bread, desserts and candy it will be disgusting!You can use the color test. Are your carbohydrates white, beige, tan, or brown? Then they are lifeless. They have very little to offer you.Are they all shades of green, orange, red, yellow, blue, purple, pink? Then they have abundant nutrients for you.You can also use the raw/cooked test. Would you be able to eat a handful of your carbohydrate raw? Would you eat a handful of raw rice, raw corn or raw black beans? Only if you wanted a few less teeth and a vicious stomachache!! You might not enjoy raw vegetables, but they are certainly fine (and some are more nutritious) to consume uncooked.As carbohydrates go, grains and beans possess the fewest nutrients and the most energy (calories). You need less calories and more nutrition so choose vegetables as your carbohydrates. Many people panic at the idea of not stuffing themselves each day with bread, crackers, bagels, pasta, rice, beans, cereal, and tortillas. “But what will I eat?!?!?!?!” they wail. Below is a very long list of excellent carbohydrate choices.When choosing fruits and vegetables, choose those grown in the most sustainable manner in the healthiest soil. They will have the most nutrition. Choose fruits in season, rotating your choices throughout the year just as our ancestors did before refrigerated warehouses and cross-global food transport. Choose varieties labeled “heirloom” if possible in order to ensure a diverse, safe food supply. Often older varieties of fruits, especially apples, contain less simple sugars and more nutrientsThis diet has never been proved to cure heart disease. There has never been any clinical trials published in medial journals to show it is safe. It has all the ingredients to contribute to heart disease. The only published clinical trial that has shown to reverse heart disease is the plant based diet of Dr. Esselstyn .You are like a lot of Quacks, always put the cart before the horse!Your comment, “This diet has never been proved to cure disease” is a straw-man.The Perfect Diet will help PREVENT heart disease!Its part of a LIFE STYLE!Don’t SMOKE! Don’t drink ALCOHOL to access! Eat ORGANIC food, if you can! EXERCISE!Get a Rebounder; the Ultimate exerciser in the world! 30 minutes a day, in the comfort & privacy of your own home, 365 days of the year. You can dance & exercise to John Fogerty’s Ultimate Collection. Avoid STRESS! Stay CELIBATE! Ha, ha, ha.And never forget, we ALL have a Sell By Date!Enjoy life!Its later than you think!Dr. Greger: Love your presentations, love your site. Thanks so much for all you do for us. My question: What do old vegans die of?Check this video. He says he has been a vegan for only 50 years, but is a doctor, so he might know. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfYphKNWT9kdocscience: I really enjoyed that link. Thanks for sharing it.Amazing!!! Thank you for the deeply researched knowledge and the passion you put into this cause!!!Have you heard of Soylent? http://robrhinehart.com/?p=424 I know how fond you are of whole plant foods, but this is vegan (I think) and supposed to have everything you need. Everything. Thoughts?This was an excellent and entertaining presentation Dr Greger :) Thank youSince Dr Colin Campbell is emphasizing the benefit of looking at the whole diet and the whole effect of the diet on health and quality of life of seniors, we need more studies to prove that vegans do live longer than non-vegans or that vegan seniors have a better quality of life compared to non-vegans. Some studies seem to indicate that infrequent animal product eaters or almost vegans who include some seafood like monthly seem to outlive vegans. Most traditional diets including longevity communities (except for vegans in adventist communities) do include a small amount of animal products (maybe around < 5 % of calories). The adventist health study 2 is waiting for more study participants to die before we can be surer about the pattern that almost vegetarians who eat monthly seafood outlive the vegans. Caloric restriction on apes and humans are also still ongoing.Fantastic presentation which tragically will go unnoticed by the Standard American Diet (SAD) eating American. If only someone would listen! I hope Dr. Greger continues his cause to help our society learn the underlying problems with our “desease care” system.One thing that would be useful is recognizing that what people eat has deep psycho-social and physiologic influences. It’s human nature to want to stay with what is familiar and easy.I am pretty isolated in my life with eating vegetarian/vegan/raw, etc., so I have fallen off the raw food diet, but I’m now working to build up a support system. There are so many celebrations and social opportunities involving crappy food.For me to make healthy choices is sometimes difficult, and then I have a 12-year-old son. There is nothing but processed food as far as the eye can see, and my husband isn’t on board (yet?) with eliminating processed foods.I wasn’t able to give up diet sodas until I was dx. with osteopenia last summer. I had tried to quit many times, and would make it a month, but returned to it. Illness is a big motivator. I think it takes a LOT of social support to make meaningful, long term changes in eating behavior.I am hopeful that people will continue to shift towards plant based diets, thanks to the Internet, and then I (and others like me) will not be the odd man out.zennifer: It is so hard to be isolated. I understand the importance of having a support group – especially so when your own family doesn’t get it.I don’t know where you live, so this may not be a practical suggestion, but I will share what has worked in my smallish city: creating a Meetup.com group. We have a vegetarian/vegan Meetup group where people of “like mind” hang out socially twice a month. We have potlucks, summer picnics, watch movies, go to restaurants, do ‘afternoon tea’, hike, etc. There are people of all walks of life and ages. The one thing we have in common is that everyone is interested in a plant based diet – even if not everyone actually eats that way all the time.The reason I bring this to your attention is that we have found that Meetup does a good job of getting the word out. So, if you don’t find a Meetup group in your area that already fits the bill, you could create one and you may find it quickly filling with so many people in your area who you didn’t even know share a similar desire to be healthy or stop animal suffering or save the planet. The majority of our membership came not from word of mouth, but from people doing internet searches or hearing about us from Meetup events advertized by Meetup to people in our area.Just an idea for you to try to get less isolated. Best of luck to you.Dr. Greger you do great work. Thank youDear Dr. Gregor, Does your Apple A Day DVD have closed captions? I loved it and really want my mother to watch it, but she is hard of hearing and needs the captioning.I loved your presentation a lot. It was true, right to the point and funny. I am not a vegan yet, but I am definitely going to that direction. I just found a new European superfood on the net, named Flavon. It is made from real fruits and vegetables, without preservatives. I feel great and sleep better since I started taking it last month. It is available on flavonmaxx.com. The company claims that one teaspoon Flavon has the effective ingredients of 2.5-3 lbs fruits and veggies. Isn’t that great? Have you heard about this product yet? Please google flavonmaxx and let me know what do you think.I want to add this to my playlist, but although I am logged in, when I click to add to playlist, it says I can only do that if I am registered. When I click to register, it says I’m already registered. Absolutely terrific video, by the way! I will be sharing far and wide.Marijuana has also been proven to stop MS progression.THC Hemp Oil has “unofficially” been proven by “private testamonies only” to cure life threatening stage 4 cancer growth. Anyone found trying to produce THC Hemp Oil without government licence will be arrested and or jailed!!Need the transcript here too.I have friends who advocate clean meats–home raised, grass fed, small farmers, etc. They quote “science” as to why these products are different from commercially raised animal products.. And what about the larger companies that supply organic or grass fed animal products? Do these products effect the health of the human person at the same level as the typical grocery store/restaurant/fast food product? Is there as much concern about pathogens and the negative effects of saturated fats and animal protein, etc. with the alternative sources as listed above? If you could clarify this in your “nutritionfacts.org” style, I would be most thankful!There is NO fundamental difference, the meat will still have all the toxic, bacterial, and chemical properties regardless of how it’s raised. The facts are there now, meats and dairy and sugar is toxic to the human system. It’s up to you to decide whether to consume these poisons in smaller doses, or not at all.I loved your presentation very much. It it true, right to the point and funny. We need to eat more fruits and veggies, that’s why I like Flavon so much. Google flavonmaxx for more info.I have purchased 5 copies for my family members. I noticed there is no copyright notice and I was hoping that meant I could arrange a public screening without fear of prosecution. Is this correct?Be Careful, the authorities do not like the truth!GREAT PRESENTATION! I WILL BE SENDING THIS OUT TO MANY! YOU DISCUSSED DIABETES, CANCERS, AND HEART DISEASE…I HAVE COPD AND TOLD IT IS IRRIVERSIBLE AND PROGRESSIVE…I HATE TAKING THE DRUGS THEY HAVE GIVEN ME AND AM ASKING YOU IF YOU KNOW OF ANY OTHER WAY TO REVERSE THIS DREADFUL DISEASE….ANYTHING WILL BE GREATLY APPRECATED AND THANK YOU FOR THE VIDEO TRULY INFORMATIVE AND VALUED… I HAVE BEEN SMOKE FREE FOR 15 YEARS, AND WAS DIAGNOSED IN 2006… 8 YEARS LATER.. BEST REGARDS , GISELLEThank you for your passion and generosity !Michael Greger, Nikola Tesla, Ayrton Senna – definition of inspirational, unselfish, worldly. Dr. Greger is anyone working on translating this and the Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death video?Please, The video is not avaiable. Could you upload new one? Thans a lot.YouTube has been very busy lately removing videos for what they call “violated YouTube’s Terms of Service”. How (in the h***) is a video presentation that educates people on how to live longer and healthier by eating a vegan diet “violating” ANY terms of service??? I am OUTRAGED!! Luckily I watched this video a couple days ago, but I had shared the link with my Facebook and Twitter friends, only to be told the video has been removed! What’s the chance that the meat and/or dairy industry is somehow partnered (or highly invested into) YouTube/Google?? HmmmThis is blatantly the work of government agencies putting pressure on G00gle…if this page hits the top search for “An apple a day, I am in no doubt G00gle will impose a penalty on it!!!”….we shall see!Why was this video removed from youTube, too disturbing to the powers to be???Great video. I came here to get the link to share it with some friends, but it says “unavialbe” here on your site and on youtube. I’m on the east coast of the USvideo unavailable today 27-08-2013…The video is unavailable today. Also couldn’t find it on Youtube. Can you fix that? Your videos are helping me a lot with convincing people to become vegan as they demonstrate the value of it very well.I was there for this presentation! Up in the balcony :) haha…just watched it again. Thanks so much Doc, YOU ROCK !!! :)What the heck?! This Video has been deleted by You Tube?! Are they scared about the truth of what the USDA is doing? I am rooting for this page to hit the top spot on G00gle for the search term “An Apple a day” keep the content flowing on this page people!!!Video removed http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyyHsb6WGgY G00gle workingon behalf of the NSA?!!!THIS WAS THE GREATEST, MOST EPIC VIDEO I HAVE EVER SEEN! Awesome job!Thank you for this wonderful sight and educational videos. I have been a vegan for 11 years, but I always feel there is more to learn. Everything I have learned from your videos is helping me to feed my family an even healthier vegan diet.Hi Dr Greger,I hope you are well.I am interested to know what your thoughts are on the findings announced today that obese people who lose weight will never succeed in getting their stomach to correctly tell their brain when they are full. See here: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-16/research-finds-key-to-why-dieters-ultimately-fail/4960536 with particular reference to its implications for those who might be overweight or obese and are on a wholefoods plant-based diet as part of a regime to help manage their weight.I would love to know your thoughts. kind regards,BenThanks for this very imteresting presentation, but can you put up a transcript of it, including all the literaturę references covered? The lecture simply goes too fast for a person to be able to assess the information thoroughly. Thanks! (sorry if this is a repeat question or the text is already available)John Doe: I can see why you would want a transcript and all the references in one place. Unfortunately, this site is run all by volunteers – including Dr. Greger. I don’t think we have the resources to do what you request on this big one hour video.On the plus side, this one hour video is a summary of several individual shorter videos that are also available on this site for free. Under each of those shorter videos are sections for both transcripts and sources cites. It takes a bit of work to find the video of interest, but it can be done. Another thing you can try is to find the beginning of say “volume 12″? (not sure which one would be appropriate) and keep hitting, “next video”. That will give you all the detail you need in nice, short chunks.I have watched this particular video three times and learned new things each time. So, I agree that there is a lot of material here that is impossible to absorb all at once.Hope that helps and good luck to you.Fantastic mr Greger! You make a great job…I apreciate too much this. Congratulation.I am wondering if you have any information on what the causes of death are for healthy vegans? If the occurrences of cancer and heart disease are drastically reduced, what kills the healthy vegan?I haven’t seen a study on this issue. I would imagine that we die of similar diseases but later and with less drugs, procedures and disability. Of course we don’t do many autopsies in medicine especially if our patients are older. In the airline industry every time there is a crash they investigate it and come up with recommendations to avoid problems in the future. That is why flying commercial airlines is so much safer then going to a physician or a hospital. Of course we do have one subspecialty that approaches the airline industry in safety and that is Anesthesiology. The rest of us… I’m a primary care physician… are somewhere between mountain climbing and bungee jumping. We have a long way to go.Fair enough. Are you aware of any research that shows how many more years on average a healthy vegan is supposed to live than somebody on a SAD diet?Sheldon: I’ve seen a study showing vegetarians living an average of 7 years longer. I’m not at a place where I have access to that reference, but I could look for it in a few days if you are interested.That is fine. A rough idea is all I was looking for. Thank you very much.Great video! What you can learn form this could save many visits to your doctor !!At (23:11) it says that eggs cannot be advertized as “healthy or nutritious” . I am searching for any confirmation about this in USDA sites, but have not found anything to confirm this. The only thing that I have found is this http://www.ars.usda.gov/News/docs.htm?docid=18963 Can you please give us links, or other verification to where the USDA says this. People have been asking me for this. There must be several other people reading this,, who need to know also. Thankyou.Dr. Greger will share this information in a future video. The only health aspect the egg industry can legally advertise is not their insufficient lutein, not the insufficient omega 3, and not even the protein. The only thing they can share is their high choline content which people tend to get alot of and new evidence shows that getting more then necessary is harmful.To reiterate what a previous poster has put about eggs, neither nutritious or healthy but what about the albumin? If one was to separate the yoke from the white, would this be significantly safer? Would one still be advised to consume no more than 3 eggs per week? The albumin has not been covered in anything on here that I could find.Hi Pr13, Great question. Egg whites contain albumin (or albumen), which is, indeed, a protein. The problem with ingesting protein from animal sources is that it triggers release of IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor :( . Check out Dr. Greger’s video on IGF-1 for a more thorough explanation: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-intake-and-igf-1-production/Dr Greger. My partner has just been diagnosed with cancer. Not sure yet whether ovarian or bowel but certainly secondaries. We are beginning to eat more organic and juice vegetables etc. If sugar feeds cancer cells then how should we use beetroot in the diet (as this is high in sugar) cooked, steamed, raw as a juice mix with carrot and apple? We are thinking it has benefits for the liver prior to chemo.Avoiding carbohydrates is not the best approach. Check out the data on Cancer nutritionfacts.org has to offer. http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/DON’T DO CHEMO!! Chemo wipes out the bodies immune system and kills healthy cells too! My mother died this January after a battle with lung cancer. She had one round of chemo…it destroyed her bodies defenses, along with healthy lung and liver tissues…her body could not recover from the chemo…she’s gone.Most people do not die from cancer, they die from the chemo. Those who say they survived cancer after getting chemo, will not only have the cancer return later, but they will get other diseases due to the destruction of their bodies immune system and organ tissues being destroyed.Get her on an ALL ORGANIC VEGAN diet…NO processed foods…and increase exercise. She can beat the cancer WITHOUT chemo…AND she will have a longer, happier, more energized life as a side-effect.I saw you this past Sunday in San Diego, I am already a vegan, nevertheless I learned so much, I changed my diet starting Monday morning, less peanut butter and more broccoli. Thank you for your life-saving videos! I am forwarding this video to all the friends, family, and people who are willing to listen and learn! Thank you Dr. Greger!An Apple A Day video presentation is the best one yet!Hi Dr Greger. Aren’t we all going to die of one of these diseases (stroke, heart attack, cancer) eventually. Is your talk aimed at prematurely dying of these things?Many chronic diseases are completely preventable. The idea here is to prevent these diseases from occurring in the first place and extending ones quality of life as long as possible.MarmeladetheCat: You are expressing a very common belief, i.e.: that problems like heart disease and cancer are just a natural part of aging. Your question is a good one.However, I would challenge your underlying assumption–that we will all die of these diseases, and it is just a question of when. Dr. Esselstyn says that heart disease is a “paper tiger.” That no one need ever get heart disease. It is a choice. Similarly, if you watch enough videos on this NutritionFacts site, you will see that many cancers are also a choice. For example, Dr. Greger talks about many Japanese men from WWWII dying *with* their prostate cancer, not *because* of it. In other words, they had some cancer cells, but the cancer was so slow growing (because of diet we believe) that the cancer wasn’t what actually killed the men. This isn’t to say that all cancers are the result of poor diet choices, but it is to say that we aren’t necessarily destined to die of cancer.So, the question is, what do vegans die of? (And by vegan, *I* mean a whole plant-based food eater who ate that way her whole life after weaning and was breast fed by a similarly healthy woman.) I recently listened to a video on line by Dr. McDougall who posed and answered that very question. What do vegans die of? Dr. McDougall said that vegans die of old age. “What is old age?” he asked. Old age is when one day you go to sleep. And then your heart stops. It is a peaceful way to go according to Dr. McDougall.I don’t know how many such deaths Dr. McDougall has witnessed, so I don’t know how much of an authority he is on the topic. And I don’t know how long one must be a vegan to be able to expect such a fine death at the end of a long healthy life. But I do think it is an excellent answer. It’s what I’m going for. :-)So, while I’m sure Dr. Greger most definitely does want to prevent us from *prematurely* dying of these diseases, I believe that Dr. Greger’s bigger aim is to help prevent us from dying of these diseases at all. While I don’t speak for Dr. Greger, I believe this is how we can interpret Dr. Greger’s first hour-long presentation, Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death. If you haven’t seen that video, it’s another great one to watch.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/I hope these thoughts prove helpful to you.Can you explain why WHO in 2011 says Coronary Heart Disease in uganda is ranked 69 and 130 per 100,000 while usa is ranked 135 with 88 per 100,000. You would think these would be reversed by quite a large margin if they were consuming a plant based diet, and there death rate was that low…Considering that Uganda is a third world country and the threat of poverty and famine are day to day struggles for the majority of the population, it is difficult to assert that this population is a just comparison considering that they live nothing like we do. The stresses of poverty can have very poor physiological effects on the body.I love this website! Dr G I have derived enormous motivation and inspiration over the past 8 months as I have gone vegan largely due to your great information. We need more fact based information that is readily summarized and understood as so much of the world remains unnecessarily shrouded in mysticism, fad, and greed-based denial or misinformation. Thank you again.Thanks a lot per this information.Many, many thanks Dr Greger for your bite size videos. as a keen student I am so frustrated not being able to do research anymore due to CFS and fibromyalgia. I started a low fat vegan diet 12 months ago, it is defenately helping. Please keep up the good work. thanks againThank you so much for this video. I am 19, and am ready to begin my new healthy life. I never had the strength to let go of meat, and animal products, but you have definitely encouraged and inspired me to do so.Good to hear!Kelly: Congratulations on taking the plunge! You are ahead of the game compared to so many people. I am envious of your decision. I wish I had done the same thing when I was your age.There are lots of other videos on this site to provide further inspiration as you need it. Best of luck to you.Your videos are very informative, and we are viewing them regularly. Question: Since it is high in calcium, can nettle leaf be used to increase bone density? If so, are there any studies? What is your opinion?Hi Dr. Greger – My son and I have an ongoing debate about hypertension and diet. The debate is about hereditary hypertension vs hpertension caused by poor diet and exercise. What percentage of people with hypertension can reduce it to normal levels (meaning no medication required) with diet and exercise alone? Looking forward to your response. Thank you!Based on my clinical experience and the studies that I have read I estimate that at least 90% of folks on blood pressure medication can get off their medications over time. Patients often see alot of improvement in the first week. This is why it is important for them to work with their physicians so their blood pressures don’t go too low. However in my experience there is continued improvement over time. What is “normal” is another issue entirely. If you have “normal” BP and are on no medications and go on a better diet and your blood pressure will generally get lower. The first case is an example of secondary prevention (curing the disease and being off medications) and the latter is primary prevention. There will still be patients that benefit from treatment. Dr. McDougall did a nice newsletter article available for free on his website… see November 2009 issue for “How I treat Patients with Elevated BP”.Dr. Forrester – thank you so much for your time and your response. Great information and it settled our debate,. Have a wonderful holiday!Brilliant Presentation! funny, entertaining, true, brilliant! Great Job! I have sent this to many of my friends and family! It is amazing that even after people get a severe life threatening disease they are still addicted to eating the SAD diet. It breaks my heart. Thank you again for putting it all into a presentation that I can share with my family! My husband and I host healthy lifestyle immersion opportunities on Maui and I have a vegan and raw food culinary institute (www.bodytemplegourmet.com). May I forward some of your information to our students and direct them to your site please? Also do you have a list of your sources of where you obtain your information? I’m sure you filter out the research that is biased by corporation support. Also, if you ever need some R&R you are welcome to stay in our private cottage nestled in Maui nature for free… just a short walk away from a beautiful waterfall. We would be delighted to host you and we so appreciate all you are doing for the planet and people. Thank you!Heaven: re: “Also do you have a list of your sources of where you obtain your information?”This video is one of Dr. Greger’s year-in-review videos and he isn’t able to list all the sources. However, if you find the individual videos on this site which he is referencing in this summary, you will see a “sources cites” section under the video. Dr. Greger even gives you a link to the study when he is able.If you enjoyed this year-in-review video, you may also enjoy the other one:http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/Your place in Maui sounds wonderful. Thanks for telling us about it.This is one of the best video I’ve never seen. Fantastic!! Thank you very much!! Now I think I’ll run out of the room when I’ll see a chicken in someone’s house. Ugh! I feel like I should talk about all these stuff to everyone! It’s so sad that such important information remain almost hidden. Thanks again, Cheers from Italy. SaraI’ve always described myself as an opportunistic, “best choice available” eater; & since vegetation’s always been available, I’ve merely taken that opportunity, thus _appearing_ to be vegan. After watching Greger’s talks , I’m committed; I’ll fast if meat’s the only thing available.Always appreciate the information.It is good that you are moving all of your videos to vimeo. Youtube removed all of durianriders videos and he promotes a raw vegan diet. He took up a petition and got enough signatures to get Youtube to look at his videos and they are all back up now.But Youtube should have taken a look at your videos since the above video got over 1 million page views on Youtube. I have an article called Prevent and Reverse Disease with a Plant-Based Diet. I have just replaced the Youtube link to your video on it with the Vimeo one. It mentions some of the things that you say in this video (so it is in writing) and it has a link to the study you mentioned– coronary heart-disease in Africans and Asians in Uganda. http://hub.me/afLlg I just added to it the video saying that Al Gore is now a vegan. Since the meat industry sued Oprah Winfrey and they lost (with your help), maybe they complained about your videos.Dr. Greger,excellent presentation and information! Thank you for your commitment to health and bringing this knowledge to a broader audience. I am a GI nurse at a large hospital and have worked as an oncology nurse for ten years before that. It’s so refreshing to hear you speak about nutrition and give evidence based studies to back up what many of us nurses already know but aren’t supported in teaching to our patients. Please continue to speak and enlighten our society on this important issue. Your message needs to be heard over and over until more change can (hopefully) take place. With much Gratitude~ Jamie RNDr. Greger, physiotherapists are good candidate for life style trainers However, we can refer patients to diabetes association, but not to vegetarian association -even for obesity patient with knees pain.Can someone quickly point to anywhere Dr. Greger possibly addresses the very often asked question, or point, that some people bring up, that it’s not “meat” per se that’s bad for us, it’s factory-farmed meat, and that grass-fed meat is actually healthy. There’s a so-called “humane” slaughterhouse being built in Sullivan County, NY and in the area’s publication — The River Reporter — there’s a pro and con discussion going on in the opinion section. Some friends of mine need some good ammunition to debunk, among other things, her contention that grass-fed “meat” (ugh hate the word!) is healthy. Thanks in advance.ifyoucareenough: I don’t have much of an original answer for this, but two of the NutrtionFacts team members have answered this question in the past. Here are their answers.Dr. Don Forrester wrote: “[humans] are designed as “hind gut fermenting herbivores” a lot of data to support the anatomy and physiology of this hypothesis. Beyond that meat from grass fed animals also contains saturated fat which is metabolized to cholesterol and dioxins…see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-the-food-supply/which are in the air as a product of burning plastics. It is true that grass fed animal meat is healthier then animals via CAFO’s but that doesn’t make it healthy.” … “[Some people may have] a similar argument about fish which is even easier to address see video… http://nutritionfacts.org/video/farmed-fish-vs-wild-caught-2/ ”And Toxins also wrote an excellent reply: “endotoxins, xenoestrogens, increases in igf-1 and arachidonic acid. All are inherent components of meat whether organic or conventional. http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=endotoxin http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=IGF-1 http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=xenoestrogen http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=arachidonic+acid ”I would add saturated fat and cholesterol to the list of problems. Another point I like to make is that people who push meat like to talk about primitive cultures who ate mainly meat. Before modern times, those animals would have been more naturally raised or wild animals. And yet we have plenty of evidence that people eating those animals suffered bad health consequences by eating those animals. It’s not a 30 second sound-bite, but if someone wants to learn more about those arguments and counter-arguments, Plant Positive has a very scholarly and fully referenced set of videos on YouTube.Or you might check out the website by HealthyLongetivity. Here is a quote from that site: “I have already posted several articles describing the poor health of populations who subsisted predominantly on naturally raised animal foods which you can find below: http://healthylongevity.blogspot.com/2012/11/traditional-diets-in-asia-pacific-and.html http://healthylongevity.blogspot.com/2012/08/forks-over-knives-and-healthy-longevity_17.html ”Here is another quote from Healthy Longetivity: “It is well established that saturated fat (in specific lauric, myristic and palmitic acids) raises total and LDL cholesterol, and that LDL cholesterol is an established cause of cardiovascular disease. The cholesterol raising effects of saturated fat is not the result of how the animal was raised as tropical plant fats high in lauric, myristic and palmitic acids will also raise total and LDL cholesterol.http://healthylongevity.blogspot.com/2013/01/diet-heart-problematic-revisit-part-ii.htmlAs I previously pointed out, it has been demonstrated in thousands of animal experiments that the feeding of cholesterol and saturated fat, including in the form of fresh egg yolk accelerates the development of atherosclerosis in virtually every vertebrate species that has been sufficiently challenged. This includes mammalian, avian and fish species- herbivores, omnivores and carnivores, and over one dozen different species of nonhuman primates. Again this cannot be attributed to the way that the animal was raised as when taking into consideration the amount of antioxidants and carotenoids as well as the lack of cholesterol, tropical plant fats high in lauric, myristic and palmitic acids will also accelerate atherosclerosis in animals to a similar degree as saturated animal fats. http://healthylongevity.blogspot.com/2013/04/cracking-down-on-eggs-and-cholesterol_7.htmlIt has been shown in controlled feeding trials that heme iron from meat causes the production of NOCs (N-nitroso compounds) in the digestive tract which in-turn causes DNA adducts in the human digestive tract. Therefore the heme iron content in meat rather than how the animal was raised can partly explain the positive association between red meat and colorectal cancer. http://healthylongevity.blogspot.com/2012/08/forks-over-knives-and-healthy-longevity.html”*My* bottom line is: There may be *marginal* health advantages to an animal product raised “naturally”, but in the end, the main problems are inherent with the product themselves regardless of how the animal was treated.Hope that helps.Yes it does, thank you very very much Thea!What do you all think of this article?:Kale? Juicing? Trouble Ahead – NYTimes.comWhat do you all think of this NYT opinion article (“Kale? Juicing? Trouble Ahead”)http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/kale-juicing-trouble-ahead/?_r=1&amp;In the topics I see “pap smear”, but cannot find the segment about it. Can someone help me?HI Carlo, you clicked on “pap smear” and found it led to the video “More Than an Apple a Day: Combating Common Diseases”. In this yearly presentation, Dr. Greger talks about pap smears for testing (at the 26 minute mark) as a common reason for a doctor’s visit. Since pap smears are a lab test and not impacted by nutrition there is not a video segment for them.What an incredible presentation Dr. Greger! I have spent the day watching your videos and absorbing the education and wonderful humor. I am a Physician Assistant, but no longer practicing and am now a devotee to the vegan lifestyle out of my love for animals and curing myself of two autoimmune diseases (Grave’s and dermatomyositis) without one ounce of conventional treatment or pharmacology. Look forward to following and sharing your message!!WOW! That was a GREAT presentation! Your my favorite funny Doctor. Everything you said was true and sad at the same time. I’m just glad I’m a vegan. :)You are hilarious Dr. Greger. We as a movement are doing our best to help to move you down o the list of common killers!You are such a fantastic speaker, Dr. Greger. I heard you in Toronto a couple of years ago and have gradually given up milk and eggs, my last hurdles to veganism. I learn so much from your daily videos and this extended dose was just such a treat.I’m wondering if it’s just meat in general that’s the problem or is it farm raised, hormone injected, and improperly butchered meats that’s the problem? Loved this video great points were made!!You mention the dangers of methionine, and I notice it is listed as an ingredient in Ener-G Egg Replacer, which many vegans rely on for baking, etc. Should we eschew it entirely? How much is too much?Spreading the love here Doctor. Thank youDr Greger! You are my hero. I spend far too much time on your site and researching nutrition but I can’t learn enough! I would love to see your live discussions but unfortunately I live in Australia.. any chance you’ll be doing a tour one day???Good afternoon, thank you for such an easily understood explanation for essential tremor. I have had a mild case for over 20 years, I am 44 right now and have found that it is much better without Diet Coke but can’t seem to kick it completely. I haven’t eaten any meat or chicken in over 20 years and have fish maybe 2 or 3 times a week. Is there another way that I could have come across neurotoxins or Harmane? I started to notice the tremor when I gave meat and chicken up for good when I was about 20. Any advice?Amazing presentation! Thank you Dr. Greger for this information.I remember seeing one of your videos wherein you talked about a study that looked at kitchen contamination. I desperately want to share that, but have not been able to find it – would you point me in the right direction please? Thank you so much!I was always a meat eater and I was told that it was healthy and that we needed the protein, but I have watched “Uprooting the leading causes of death” and this video and I am shocked by the truth. Needless to say, and I never thought I would say this, I am officially on a whole foods plant based diet. Thank you so much, and I hope that you can convince others just like you did me!• Low-carbohydrate–high-protein diet and long-term survival in a general population cohort (2006)• Low carbohydrate–high protein diet and mortality in a cohort of Swedish women (2007)• Low-carbohydrate diets and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: Two cohort Studies (2010)• Low protein intake is associated with a major reduction in IGF-1, cancer, and overall mortality in the 65 and younger but not older population (2014)Good luck.Emma: Thanks for sharing your story! There is definitely a lot of mis-information about protein out there.If you want to really solidify your understanding of human protein requirements, here are my favorite sources:http://michaelbluejay.com/veg/protein.htmlhttp://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/newsletter/archives/ (check out December 2003 for McDougall’s site, “A Brief History of Protein: Passion, Social Bigotry, Rats, and Enlightenment”. Also April 2007, “When Friends Ask: Where do you get your protein?”)Not only are our protein requirements much lower than most people think, but there is ample evidence that excess protein leads to all sorts of health issues. I wanted to post a list of referneces that a frequent contributor, Darryl, recently gave us, but I’m having Disqus issues. (sigh)Anyway, thanks again for sharing. And good luck.Hi everyone,I have just read all of the posts and I am in tears! My life for the past 10 yrs has been,I don’t know how to put it, I guess lonely and loveless. I’m 26yrs I ve been with my fiance for 10 yrs and we have 2 sons. Our oldest 7 has AS too and my youngest 3 has autism. I feel so lonely in my family, none of them understand me at all and don’t try. I feel like i ve lost myself. I is much harder to deal with my Fiance then my kids of course, because I shouldn’t have to parent him. I don’t want to parent 3 people, I want love. He doesn’t even feel love I don’t think! I’m very sad thinking that I am putting my self in this position, to never put myself 1st or get anything I need or want it life. My family nor his gets it and they say that because he works and takes care of his family with money I should be happy enough. I wish there were groups where iI live but I haven’t found and yet. I’m very happy to find other people out there dealing with this, because living life like this is very lonely. I would love to start talking with some of you,all things happen because great zalilu was very great to me,after he help me getting back my man every thing have be working fine.Please you can contact he for help so you can be happy in your relationship.Email him at;greatzalilu@gmail.comI never really know where to post a general question, so here goes. I wonder if you have a view on the recent piece in the NY Times reporting diet has little or no impact on cancer? http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/science/an-apple-a-day-and-other-myths.html?_r=0Hi Dr. Greger. I really appreciate these videos you make. I started going vegan about two years ago after watching your videos. I am 20 years old in college. I try to convince my professors and students around me about the benefits of plant-based foods, and harms of animal-based foods, but they don’t really believe me. Where should I go for grad school or employment if I want to get more educated and practice plant-based nutrition to help save lives? Here is my email address julian_sho_morris@yahoo.comDr Greger: Thank you for this website and your depth of research. I’m wondering if you have a comment on the Wall Street Journal piece linked here: http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303678404579533760760481486?KEYWORDS=fat&mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303678404579533760760481486.html%3FKEYWORDS%3DfatI see the link didn’t come through. It is a 5/2/14 piece in the Wall Street Journal entitled: “The Questionable Link Between Saturated Fat and Heart Disease.”Are there anymore yearly review hour long videos? I would like to watch them, thankyou :)Hi Jessica: there are dvds/digital downloads for sale here: http://www.drgreger.org/downloads. All sales go to charity.Thankyou :)Stunning and life altering. My Mom was a hospital dietician, and NEVER KNEW the harm associated with a omnivorous diet. I have refused statins for 3 years, but been unable to reduce my stratospheric cholesterol levels. I have had Dr’s assure me there is NO reversing of arterial plaques once they are deposited. As a non smoker and an exercise fit individual I hoped for a solution that wouldn’t cause my liver to suffer. Fortunately, I have had a life long love affair with berries, fruits, vegetables (as well as EGGS, CHICKEN, TURKEY, LOBSTER, NATURAL CASING FRANKS, ETC) so putting myself on a vegan diet the last few weeks since being exposed to the startling research facts in just a few hours of viewing your videos, has not been a huge hardship. Berries every day? It’s like dessert at every meal..! No more sugar? I now know I can beat that addiction as sincerely as I approach an opiate addiction, BECAUSE I know it is slowly killing me. A Doctor finally told me the whole truth about the effects of what I have been eating. I want to LIVE well (and that means being healthy), far more than I want to ever taste certain foods again. At age 55 I am confident the changes will make a huge difference, and since I have never yet been diagnosed with high BP, cancer, or heart ailments (non-smoker, moderate exerciser, average fitness, sugar & egg & fat addict) making the change to a plant based diet can only improve the odds of keeping it that way. Once I understood I was being poisoned by my food, change was not a choice but an imperative, thank you for this information no one else provided.Hollywood Resident: It’s so sad when I hear about people who would just love to cure themselves through a healthy diet, but had been told by doctors that there was nothing they could do. Happily, there are doctors like Dr. Greger and more and more others (including several participants on this site) who are getting the word out.Congratulations on making what is for some people a very hard change in your diet. I’ll think good thoughts for you. I am sure this is going to make a huge difference in your health. Good luck.Thanks, but as I say it’s not a hard decision at all once you know you’re getting toxins from meat/dairy/sugar. If rat poison tasted like heaven, I still wouldn’t consume it. As to my health, I am actually in perfect health other than having very elevated cholesterol for 20 years… I’m just hoping I don’t end up with a sudden cardiac event before a few years of vegan eating has the chase to reverse some of the plaquing that must exist. It’s criminal for Dr’s to not inform people they’re consuming toxins in foods.Amazing video. Conventional medicine focuses on symptoms instead of looking at root causes, preventing illness and maintaining health. Besides, the allopathic approach dissociates each aspect of the body from the whole and that is just not how the body works…Transfats in dairy? How come when I enter the same dairy products shown in this video into CronOMeter, zero transfat is shown, regardless of quantity?Do non cancerous tumors require extra methionine as well for growth? It it reasonable to conclude that non cancerous tumors can be shrunk with a vegan diet?wow this is eye opening and terrifying at the same time , the whole time the education system was only teaching us to treat patients with drugs ! do you do give any lectures at international conferences ? i have never heard of something like that before though the whole articles have been published ! dear Dr Greger what is your opinion concerning chemotherapy & radiation ?Amazing i watch this all the time to keep my head on straight as to why I became a vegan! Thanks for putting this message out there Dr. Greger! Your an inspiring force in this plant powered revolution!This presentation has changed our families lives from today on. When you mentioned the starting heart disease of a ten year old , I let my ten year old hear it and he cried and said , my life is going to change now. Thank you so much for this Doctor , our family is most appreciate .Karl: Wow. This is one of the more powerful posts I have seen in a while. It is stories like these that keep me wanting to volunteer on this site. Thank you for the feedback. I’m sure Dr. Greger loves to read these stories too.Best of luck to you and your whole family!Had hilarious fun doing the gargling and it does make your lungs feel exercised, that is until we nearly choked with laughter on the water. All good now. Thanks.haha.I enjoyed this video very much! I hope a lot of doctors listen to it. BTW is this available in print format?I am most surprised and disappointed about the eggs. Why do we poison ourselves? -Trudy (Jamaica)You. Are. Awesome. LOVE your work. Thank you thank you thank you.Hi Dr. Greger,I want to thank you for your videos and presentation as they helped me achieve make the step to a healthy vegan diet. I am a 16 year old from the Netherlands and my diet has helped me lose a ton of weight and made me feel much better about myself and in general.Recently my Grandfather, which I was very fond of, died of a stroke after a long time suffering from Alzheimer’s. Seeing such an amazing person lose his connection with everything around him was painful and I can’t stand the thought of that happening to my parents, who to this day consume large amounts of dairy and meat. I want to convince them to stop doing so and at least make steps towards veganism but I have no idea how to go about that. Their English is limited and I have not discovered any good Dutch vegan sources. Do you have any advice for me?Dr. Greger: I’m a loyal follower of your teachings. Just when I think I understand it, a study like this one comes out. Would you please comment on this study summary “People with the highest consumption of high-fat dairy products — eight or more portions per day — have a 23 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those with the lowest consumption — one or less per day, a new study shows.” The reference is: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140915202955.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily%2Fhealth_medicine%2Fdiabetes+%28Diabetes+News+–+ScienceDaily%29Thanks for all of the time you donate to a healthier population! Ron GontermanOutstanding! Thank you for sharing your knowledge and passion.Amazing. A friend turned me onto your site a few months ago. I’m not only a meat eater but a hard core meat eater. I don’t just eat bacon, I buy slab bacon and cut it myself! After watching the vignettes and now the hour length film I’ve given up meat cold turkey and I’m about to try veganism. Thank you doctor Greger.Champflyer: Congratulations on your path to health! That’s really exciting.Note that Dr. Greger has a total of 3 hour long presentations. You might want to check out those videos too, plus catch up on a few videos-of-the-day as you have a chance. I thought I would also recommend the video, Forks Over Knives, which is also powerful and compelling.Going cold-turkey works great for many people. It helps to note that we are not just talking veganism, but whole plant food eating. There are some great resources that can help you figure out what whole plant food eating looks like in order to be as healthy as possible. One book you might want to check out is The Starch Solution by Dr. McDougall, which also includes recipes. I have other ideas too if you would like them.Best of luck to you!really changed my thinking and i thought i was well informed before i saw his video’s,,just need something to replace my cream in my coffee and all dairy will be gone also,,eggs and cheese will now be gone also,well maybe one pizza a month lolMiningTheMarket: I know a couple for whom it was also very important to find a way to replace cream in their morning coffee when they went vegan. After some experimentation, the husband settled on adding 1/2 coconut creamer and 1/2 soy milk. The wife just uses the coconut creamer. Not being a coffee person myself, I can’t personally comment. All I can say, is that it is possible. :-)I agree, the information in this video is great, and not widely known. If you liked this video, you may want to check out Dr. Greger’s two other hour longer summary presenations. Plus, check out the videos-of-the-day for more details and other fascinating info.Good luck!Thanks for the info.I have a cup morning and night of organic coco,,steva honey,a bit of coffee mixed in plus 10% cream.there are some subs out there,but they have Carrageenan in them,,so the organic cream would better then those??MiningTheMarket: re:”there are some subs out there,but they have Carrageenan in them,,so the organic cream would better then those??”It is a fair question. I suggest looking at Dr. Greger’s latest video on carrageenan: http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/22/should-carrageenan-be-avoided/When I compare that information to all the many, many compelling studies fully against dairy, I would personally choose some carrageenan over some dairy every time based solely on health concerns–pretending for a minute that those two options are my only choice (ie, if I really didn’t have choices say c thru g also). http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=dairyAnd then if you consider animal suffering (check out the movie, “Earthlings”) and global planet depletion (check out the movie “Cowspiracy” to learn more), the idea that dairy is an option just does not compute with me at any level.That’s just my 2 cents.Thank you very much for your reply.Yes i will stick with the 10% cream until i find something that will taste as good with out the added junk,,, mainly the Carrageenan.Guess i am hooked my my coco,but no reflux with it as with coffee,as i use very little of it,Awesome, Awesome, Awesome… Did I mention Awesome? Well it most certainly is! Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!14:06This epidemiological disease list resembles that of the modern sitting toilet (namely toilet induced strokes, appendicitis, diverticulosis, colon cancer, hemorrhoids and hiatal hernia). Sitting while defecating would be the main offender, before meat vs. plants (and fiber).These people in Africa and Asia egest food remnant and gut bacteria out of their body by Asian Squatting, not by sitting on a chair like the United-States and the third of humanity who misguidedly adopted the porcelain throne do.The quality of what you take in is important, but so is how you choose to take it out! (Think about the breath-cutting, diaphragmatic Valsalva maneuver implicated every time you go and do it wrong.)test14:06This epidemiological disease list resembles that of the modern sitting toilet (namely toilet induced strokes, appendicitis, diverticulosis, colon cancer, hemorrhoids and hiatal hernia).

Our two percent cancer survival rate in the U.S. is no match for the survival rates that some of the foreign cancer treatment centers (such as in Mexico) provide. It is our own deeply corrupted FDA who has caused the rise in holistic treatment at foreign clinics. Indeed, the first line of treatment at most of these clinics is to begin a vegan regimen and pursue plant based therapies that our FDA will not approve as part of the litany of successful cancer treatments offered in Mexico. I have first hand knowledge that these noninvasive treatments are many times the best hope for cancer patients.Can anyone explain the results in this article? Seems to run against most other results we’ve seen.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3917888/“Our results revealed that a vegetarian diet is related to a lower BMI and less frequent alcohol consumption. Moreover, our results showed that a vegetarian diet is associated with poorer health (higher incidences of cancer, allergies, and mental health disorders), a higher need for health care, and poorer quality of life.”That was amazing from beginning to end. I live in the UK, the youngest of 5 kids. As a child I learn’t about food around the table at dinner, breakfast and supper. At the age of 14 with the support of my parents, I went vegetarian and recently vegan at 48. I never really felt healthy has a vegetarian but I feel fantastic has a vegan. My family have fallen prey to; diabetes type 2 (2 brothers and mother) strokes (brother and sister) and my father died of bowl cancer. I, on the other hand, am fit and healthy. So this I could say is my little case study into the effects of food on my family and me.Thank you for continuing to keep us informed on our health and nutritional matters, the service you provide is one that I hope some day you are rewarded for greatly.Awesome! I learned a lot and many of the things discussed solidified my thoughts on nutrition and its preventative powers.Glad you found it helpful, please see here for other year in reviews. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/Thank you very much for the information http://awakenthenextlevel.com Would love to have some of your articles posted on my blogUre the best!!! I am in my third year vet school, have been whole-foods plant based almost 4 years, and mainly vegan for almost 9. I’ve been having so much fun and plan on going to medical school after I am done with vet! ;D :) Thank you for all your work! I find this as an AWESOME!! resource, THANKSThank you ,for an alternative and easier solution for cronic ailmentsA bit biased (for my taste) but still an excellent presentation and a must to watch for every health-conscious person.Hi Dr. Greger, can you please direct me to a list of sources cited for this video (More Than an Apple a Day)? Thank you.Guest: The best way to find the sources is to find the related “videos of the day” and then look in the “Sources Cited” section for those mini-videos. Dr. Greger does not list the sources for these summary videos–beyond what you can see in the video itself.12 a week! Jeez, there must be some v constipated vegans making up for my contribution!Hello: Please Eat Healthy and in moderation to all that read this, but what does this statistic mean? Looking at video at 36.46 inI am sorry. I had to stop watching this. It seemed too much like a video or presentation one would put forth towards a college class. I may have missed something, as I stopped watching ~34 minutes in and quit caring. You brought up a lot of good points, but how you approached them seamed to be guided by the purpose of what you are trying to sell. Your jokes did not help.A couple of things that jumped out at me and caused me to stop watching:You compare things to environments where they are lacking the conveniences. i.e. First world v.s. Third world.I could get by that, but then I started hearing statistics and the egg one caught my ear, and figured I would throw my thoughts out there as well from what I know. (Careful numbers of 100k+ are scary)aYou compare stats of 100,000 ‘Americans’ are reported as being having salmonella poisoned every year, but you do not state where the eggs game from. Or that 1 in 15,000-20,000 eggs may make it through the screening process may contain it based on my last research. And that 100k of the U.S. 300B may or may not have purchased said eggs from a government o.k.’ed facilityI have now finished the video, but still do not see why one should go vegan you make claims against animal byproducts. But I also noted that your ‘third’ test for chicken was not a safe zone. I.E. your average kitchen.What about human immunity? There are certain things that we grew up with and are around on a daily basis that may trigger your tests?What about the quote “safe zone” unquote for meat?as I noted that you did not mention beef or pork in the example I am concerned about those as well.This video changed my life. Thank you.I’m very thankfull for your work !What a gift these long presentations are for all of us!! Thanks for the GREAT work you’re doing Dr. Greger!I commend you for trying to inform people. Please be careful because the truth creates enemies. I really enjoyed the number of presentations I saw.Thank you so much for this hour long summery. I learned so much. Thank God for people like you.Great video, but the suspense is killing me. What are the leading causes of death for the 1950s Bantu?I have just read an article in The Atlantic Monthly. http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/the-most-common-sources-of-food-poisoning/386570/?utm_source=nl__link2_030315 I was surprised that the article attributed foodborne illness to such a degree to plants ! How does the bacteria end up on plants… ? I always wash produce in water. But am wondering if there is a better way to protect against e.coli, salmonella, and listeria? Perhaps you already made a video about this? If so, could you share the name? Thanks much .. I appreciate the site so much. RamonaHi Ramona,Good question. I am posting a link from Dr. Greger’s video on Norovirus. He explains way to reduce risk and how the contamination occurs. We appreciate you for being here, Ramona! Let me know if this helps? JosephDoctor’s NoteWhen you hear of people getting infected with a stomach bug from something like spinach, it’s important to realize that the pathogen didn’t originate from the spinach. Intestinal bugs come from intestines. Greens don’t have guts; plants don’t poop.So the Salmonella in alfalfa sprout seeds (Don’t Eat Raw Alfalfa Sprouts) likely came from manure run-off or contaminated irrigation water. But this pesticide angle adds a whole new route for fecal pathogens to pollute produce. Broccoli Sprouts are safer, and organic sprouts may therefore be safer still.Organic foods may also be healthier (see Cancer Fighting Berries) and don’t carry the potential chemical hazards associated with pesticides. See my videos:CDC Report on Environmental Chemical ExposurePreventing Parkinson’s Disease With DietCan Pesticides Be Rinsed Off?Pesticides in Chinese Bamboo ShootsPlants vs. PesticidesThat is very helpful information. Thanks so much !We are so grateful for your work and efforts Dr Greger, your work is very valued and appreciated and helps junior doctors like myself become better clinicians in the future. Thank you :)I am jubilant! I just discovered your website, and found it a treasury of practical health counsel, and solid scientific research. Although this presentation was offered two years ago, its advice remains more relevant than ever. The dark forces have done their best to keep science out of public health policy and congressional debate, while the death toll from preventable disease continues to mount. To make sure this message of alarm about the lethal American diet is heard and understood clearly, I have emailed the transcript (see “Transcript” button, above) to all my friends and family. That social network is one very effective way to spread the word rapidly. Of course, they have the option to pass it along to others. By the way, the transcript your provide is also valuable in a completely unexpected way– only a message in text format permits busy people to review the content when they cannot review the whole video. While the video is powerful– a public health “jeremiad” on its own– the text helps people review many important points from sometimes complex material. As you, Dr. Dean Ornish and Sen. Ron Wyden (D, OR) have sensed, Dr. Greger, people sometimes lose track of the forest for all the trees.Dr Greger, that is a fantastic presentation. I’ve been a strong skeptic of alternative medicine for years due to the lack of science – always feeling that if something works, we should be able to test it scientifically.Your research-based approach is such a breath of fresh air. Thank you for hard work and diligence in sourcing these studies. I’d like you to know that you have made a difference in the way my wife (cancer survivor) and I look at diet. We have only been vegan for a couple of months, but your videos and website are tremendous resources.Thank you again, and keep up the good work. You’re helping to change entrenched attitudes.I am simultaneously joyous and mortified. Thank you for sharing this wealth of information in such a intriguing and amusing way. I am two years into a whole, plant food lifestyle, still figuring it out, and attempting to educate (and gently pursuade) bewildered friends and family. These videos – all of them – are so very helpful! Your point about making it personal – imagine the faces – was extremely powerful. Thank you for your passion and determination to get the information out to the mainstream.Dr. Greger, thank you for all the great informations and thank you because you make me laugh a lot :). I’m sharing your videos with my family and friends to spread knowledge as much as possible. As I understand you must be vegan. I’ve been reading and watching documentaries about this but is seams to me like you have to be always on B12 supplement or fortified food. This doesn’t seam to be natural though, I don’t think there are long term researches on this, is it correct? I mean shouldn’t we see if at least 2-3 generations can go ahead without problems and procreate healthy children before saying that vegan is the right diet? Researches like the Cina Study for exemple, seems like the intention is to take in consideration only the pro vegan point of view but not other point of view of researches that prove them wrong. I’m vegetarian and I’m kind of scared to do the next step with dairy product because of possible food deficiencies. Can you help me have some clarity regarding this? Thank you( sorry if my english is not perfect, I’m not from the US :)Laura: Your B12 question comes up a lot and is perfectly understandable. The need for B12 supplements stems from the unnatural world we live in. If you are drinking natural (dirty) water and eating unwashed plants, you may be able to get the B12 that you need. But that’s not how we live any more, and thank goodness!Here is an analogy to provide another way to think of the B12 issue: Humans need water to survive. But that doesn’t mean that it would be healthy to get water by drinking soda/coke. There are healthier ways to get water. Similarly, getting B12 from animal sources comes with tons of unhealthy factors. It’s just not worth it since we live in a modern world in which we can easily get B12 in a safe way.Here is an article from NutritionFacts that specifically address B12 that you might find helpful: http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/25/vegan-b12-deficiency-putting-it-into-perspective/Your other question is about how to make sure you get all of the nutrients you need if you are going to drop the dastardly dairy. In order to answer that question, I need to know what nutrients you think that dairy provides that you might have trouble getting elsewhere. Are you worried about protein? Calcium? Something else? I can address those specific nutrients, but I will also point out as a general rule: There are no adult animals on this planet (humans included) which need the breast milk of another species. The reason so many people think they need dairy for important nutrients is due to very clever and insidious marketing.Let me know if you would like more information.","['abdominal fat', 'ADHD', 'aging', 'alternative medicine', 'American Egg Board', 'American Public Health Association', 'animal fat', 'animal products', 'animal protein', 'aortic aneurysm', 'appendicitis', 'autoimmune diseases', 'beans', 'beef', 'beta-carboline alkaloids', 'bladder health', 'bladder infections', 'blood pressure', 'bone health', 'breast cancer', 'breast cancer survival', 'breast health', 'cake', 'California Prune Board', 'Campylobacter', 'cancer', 'cancer survival', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cardiovascular health', 'cavities', 'CDC', 'cellulite', 'cervical cancer', 'cheese', 'chemotherapy', 'chicken', 'children', 'cholesterol', 'cluster headaches', 'colon cancer', 'colon disease', 'colon health', 'common cold', 'complementary medicine', 'constipation', 'cooking methods', 'cooking temperature', ""Crohn's disease"", 'cruciferous vegetables', 'dental health', 'depression', 'diabetes', 'diverticulitis', 'diverticulosis', 'dried fruit', 'E. coli', 'eggs', 'elderly', 'endocrine disruptors', 'erectile dysfunction', 'esophageal cancer', 'esophagus health', 'essential tremor', 'exercise', 'eye health', 'fat', 'fecal bacteria', 'fecal contamination', 'fertility', 'fibromyalgia', 'fish', 'flax seeds', 'flexitarians', 'food poisoning', 'foodborne illness', 'fruit', 'gallbladder disease', 'grains', 'Harmane', 'headaches', 'heart disease', 'heart health', 'hemorrhoids', 'hernia', 'hot sauce', 'HPV', 'hypertension', 'immune function', 'impotence', 'industry influence', 'lavender', 'LDL cholesterol', 'leukemia', 'lung cancer', 'meat', 'medications', ""men's health"", 'mental health', 'Metamucil', 'methionine', 'migraine headaches', 'milk', 'mood', 'morbidity', 'mortality', 'multiple sclerosis', 'muscle health', 'mushrooms', 'nutritional yeast', 'nuts', 'obesity', 'oils', 'oral health', 'pain', 'pap smear', 'placebo effect', 'plant protein', 'plant-based diets', 'plums', 'pork', 'prostate cancer', 'protein', 'prunes', 'PSA', 'rectal cancer', 'reproductive health', 'respiratory infections', 'safety limits', 'Salmonella', 'saturated fat', 'seafood', 'seeds', 'side effects', 'skin health', 'smoking', 'STD', 'strawberries', 'stroke', 'sugar', 'surgery', 'trans fats', 'tremors', 'turkey', 'USDA', 'vaginal health', 'vaginosis', 'varicose veins', 'vegans', 'vegetables', 'vegetarians', 'Viagra', 'viral infections', 'vision', 'water', 'weight loss', ""women's health"", 'xenoestrogens', 'Yale', 'yogurt']",Dr. Greger has scoured the world's scholarly literature on clinical nutrition and developed this brand-new live presentation on the latest in cutting-edge research on how a healthy diet can affect some of our most common medical conditions.,"In my annual nutrition review last year, Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death, I explored the role diet may play in preventing, arresting, and even reversing our top 15 killers. Actually, if you recall, the top 16. Since side effects from prescription drugs kill an estimated 106,000 Americans a year, the sixth leading cause of death may actually be doctors.And that's just from adverse drug reactions. Add in medical mistakes (which the Institute of Medicine estimates kills at least 44,000 Americans) and that brings ""health""care up to our country's third leading cause of death. Throw in hospital-acquired infections, and we're talking maybe 187,000 Americans dead every year (and millions injured) by medical care.The best way to avoid the adverse effects of medical and surgical treatments and tests is not to avoid doctors, but to avoid getting sick in the first place. This year I thought I'd run through the top dozen reasons people visit their doctors to highlight some of the latest research in hopes of moving me and my colleagues lower down the list of common killers.So you can more easily navigate through the menu of diseases I touch on, this presentation is also available on DVD through my website or Amazon.

Who wants all those chemicals polluting our planet?Monsanto, Bayer, Dow AgroSciences, Syngenta, DuPont, BASF to name a few.Try to say synthetic chemicals. as in man made, everything has chemicals in so it makes you look ignorant.Oh really? Nice post.Stephen Lucker Kelly: I knew exactly what Veganrunner meant. I imagine everyone did.I recommend you take a look at the rules for posting on this site: http://nutritionfacts.org/faq scroll to the section: “What are the rules for posting comments on this site?” The first sentence is particularly relevant for you: “The intention of the comment section … is to allow all members to share their stories, questions, and feedback with others in a welcoming, engaging, and respectful environment.” Also check out the second paragraph.Thea, I know what he meant, I meant in general conversations with people, especially on a science based website it’s better to be clear about something than not, as I read a lot of science pages and often enough if someone says chemicals instead of synthetic chemicals, they assume they are part of the bandwagon fallacy and don’t actually realise that chemicals are all over the place and people are made of chemicals. Synthetic chemicals are man made and have a negative affect due to not breaking down well in the environment. But at the same time if I collect a lot of organic chemicals to use as pesticides which isn’t naturally in high doses this also has a negative affect because it has been concentrated.So simple being organic isn’t enough. It takes people who care to do what is right and make good farming methods which keep food healthy and safe to consume. There needs to be a food safety and environmental standard association that registers farms, not just simple an organic certification, this does mean less dodgy man made stuff but it doesn’t instantly equal safe, as we all know nature just killed a lot of people in Nepal. Sadly.I haven’t broken any rules, and I suggest you read them yourself. Honest isn’t against the rules, although some people might not deal with the truth very well. I was just making a friendly suggestion so people take him more seriously on other websites.In a chemistry book sure, but in general parlance ‘chemicals’ means man-made. Put away your CRC and look in Webster’s. That’s the same logic they used to morph genetically engineered into gmo to make it seem like naturally bred plants, as commonly occuring natural chemicals, are just like gmo’s, or synthetic chemicals.Chemicals means chemicals. Obviously people miss use words in slang and I get that people usually mean man made synthetic chemicals when they say this. I do. My point is that those a bit arrogant or more science minded think that people who use the word chemicals so liberally don’t usually have any understanding of chemistry and don’t take them seriously because no one with any understanding of chemistry knows that everything is made of chemicals. But I get it people are not pc, but I would prefer that people get listened to who understand the dangers of man made chemicals and want change. This isn’t me being pedantic or a prick. I generally want people to listen more.GMOs are in no way natural. They could only exist with human intervention and would not happen naturally in the wild. Anyone who says otherwise doesn’t understand genetics.Stephen you need to chill. I understand chemistry and have had my share of chemistry classes. But I would bet you have not or you would not have commented about my use of the word and so rudely. Obviously you are new to this sight. Sit back, relax and learn a little.Not new at all, been watching these videos for 5 years. I wasn’t rude just honest. If you find honest rude, not sure how you tell people that there is a dead animal on their table. I mean how do you do that. It’s not a dead animal it’s some kind of morphed meat that is unhealthy, I don’t know maybe I just like to be straight forward sometimes over vague.I wasn’t being rude I was being helpful, if you found it rude… well I guess we have a different perspective on what is polite. Sometimes there is no way to be tactful with out the point just being missed all together.Hindsight is nice and being vague is fine, but if you want to be taken seriously it’s better to be precise.I’d have to say your own connotation to the word “chemicals” is strictly that—your own. You are arguing your own semantics against traditional, social-norm semantics. I understand where you are coming from, but you have the intellect not to assume, or critique someone as being ignorant for using the general term understood by almost all as a reference of “chemicals” induced by man. Your connotation of chemical, is like mine of compound. I view chemical compounds and being more natural, but that doesn’t mean other people have the same connotation of the word.When I use a word it means exactly what I want it to mean . . . and what everyone else understands it to mean: chemical [kem-i-kuhl] noun 1. a substance produced by or used in a chemical process. Dictionary.comVegetables good. Organic vegetables better!Fact #1: Organic farming still allows the use of pesticides, but a smaller subset of mostly natural and some synthetic ones. Fact #2: These studies only tested for specific synthetic pesticides, which to my knowledge are only used in conventional farming.So these studies showed that conventional produce has a higher concentration of the pesticides that are only allowed in conventional farming? Umm… duh? If they did a study testing only for the most commonly used pesticides used in organic farming the results would probably be very interesting.In any case, someone should do a study looking at ALL the pesticides on produce and see how they compare. Perhaps organic will be lower? Perhaps not. I don’t know. I’m actually not against organic at all, and I actually like to buy pesticide-free produce from my local farmers market because I trust them to embody the spirit of organic farming instead of the letter of the law, which allows virtually limitless spraying of approved organic pesticides.Interesting about the methodology! Did you look at the papers yourself or is this in the video? Sorry but I can’t watch the vid right now so I’ve just read the transcript at this point.I agree about preferring local/organic-ish to legally labelled organic. At the grocery store I’ll get organic if the price is decent, if not I don’t worry about it. Our co-op has local stuff in the summer but boy is it pricey. Farmer markets are limited and fleeting where I live. If I’m ever pregnant someday I would make an effort increase my organic consumption if only based on faith/precautionary principle. But for the time being I know I would have to buy a lot less variety and quantity if I only purchased organic.Organic does NOT allow for “synthetic” pesticides, but there are plenty of natural pesticides and fungicides. Organic farmers can be just as commercialized, and plenty of mega multinationals are farming organic it. Does that mean organic is safer? I don’t think know.“The sad truth is, factory farming is factory farming, whether its organic or conventional. Many large organic farms use pesticides liberally. They’re organic by certification, but you’d never know it if you saw their farming practices. As Michael Pollan, best-selling book author and organic supporter, said in an interview with Organic Gardening, “They’re organic by the letter, not organic in spirit… if most organic consumers went to those places, they would feel they were getting ripped off.”(source for above) http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/httpblogsscientificamericancomscience-sushi20110718mythbusting-101-organic-farming-conventional-agriculture/Baggman, I think you make an outstanding point. I’ll even repeat you, “factory farming is factory farming.” I will even assert that some, mostly smaller, conventional farmers who are conscientious will sometimes do a better job of environmental protection and produce safer produce than some of the organic factory farms you mention. An integrated pest management system using predator and parasitic beneficial insects while reducing but not eliminating toxic substances can still have very beneficial results. I used to know an old very conventional, and very careful entomologist who would use DDT in a heartbeat for spot applications but loudly denounce crop dusting because of the destruction of beneficial insects. Remember the organic pesticide, nicotine sulfate can kill you in a matter of minutes. DDT takes a lot more and a lot longer.So I am with you. This is not quite black and white but,,,, still organic is likely more nutritious and safer.Well said, and I agree, organic when possible.Its a start:http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/business/usda-to-start-program-to-support-local-and-organic-farming.html?_r=0Also worth a read: Has ‘Organic’ Been Oversized?http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/business/organic-food-purists-worry-about-big-companies-influence.html“Food bearing the ‘USDA Organic’ seal no longer needs to be natural food…” Read why Eden Farms, one of my favorite organic foods, does not carry the USDA organic label:http://www.edenfoods.com/articles/view.php?articles_id=78Maybe the old cliche is true, “ignorance is bliss…”baggman744: That article from Eden is very sobering.I liked Eden before, but I like them even better after reading that. Thanks for the link(s).Eden is good stuff, but expensive. Sometimes up to 100% more than conventional. That’s the challenge, and will be for some time: make healthier food safer, accessible, and affordable.re: expensive Yes! I have noticed that even factoring in a reduction with what seems like a good coupon, Eden canned beans can end up costing more than another “organic” brand at full price. There is definitely a trade-off. I have been buying Eden beans anyway for a couple of reasons, but the cost is definitely an issue. I often wonder how much that cost difference is justified.Good point. Many foods have much lower yields, and are more expensive to produce organically. Beans? Don’t know. Like all things economic, its probably several factors, as in, cost premiums are shared amongst all products. A can of conventional beans maybe 90 cents; organic, $2 dollars. Worth the expense? Sure. But if you like blueberries, conventional frozen maybe $2 to $4 dollars a pound, organic $6 to $8. Math is math. If everything organic so much more expensive, then for far too many, it’s just too cost prohibitive.While Dr. Greger has been equivocal on GMOs in general, organic is the only way to assure non GMO food in the corporate owned USA. Here in France, and in 64 countries worldwide, GMOs are labeled. BTW, I reckon Dr. Greger does NOT eat GMOs at home.I assume he does not knowingly eat GMOs, but without changes to USA’s labeling laws. How is anyone in the US suppose to know what they are getting. Of course, that is the point. Agrochemical companies have used their influence to promote the notion of “substantial equivalence” to argue that GMOs need not be labeled, and have fought tooth and nail in intellectual property courts that their products are novel, non-obvious and useful to secure patent protection.We could certainly learn from the European Union on the banning of persistent organic pollutants and labeling of food. At this point a reasonable approach is to eat organic and avoid GMO foods as much as possible. There is alot to be said for the precautionary principle as Dr. Greger mentioned. There are proven alternatives to raising foods without persistent organic pollutants and use of GMO’s foods. Fortunately we get the opportunity to vote with our purchases and eating habits. For further information see video… http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/.Hi Dr. Forrester… GMOs have been in the food supply for over 30 years… are you aware of any evidence that they are harmful?… i can’t think of another potentially beneficial product that would require more than 30 years of safety before being universally acceptedKris: I have seen the argument you are making before. It has never made sense to me. I am curious if you are making only a partial argument for brevity’s sake or if it is the entire argument?Here’s what I mean: For the last 30 years we have seen increases in all sorts of health problems. How do you know none of those problems are related to consumption of GMO foods? Or consumption of GMO foods combined with other conditions (say more pesticides on GMO foods)? Just because something has been in the food supply for a long time does not make it a safe or healthy substance to consume. After all, people have been eating processed meats for decades. That doesn’t make processed foods safe (in fact, we know the opposite is true). It just means people have been eating processed foods for a long time.For me, the question is: Are you aware of any good long term research that attempts to tease out the relationship between long term human GMO consumption and health outcomes one way or the other? In other words, the fact of people eating the food is not enough. The food has to also be rigorously evaluated for your argument to be meaningful. Are you aware of such studies and just left them out to be brief?To answer your question: I’m aware of plenty of anecdotes against GMOs. Between that and just plain common sense, I am comfortable saying that we have plenty of good reason to apply the cautionary principle to the subject of eating GMOs until we get some good scientific evidence one way or the other. It is the responsibility of proponents to prove the safety of the artificially genetically modified food. Not the other way around.To twist your statement a bit: I can’t think of another potentially more disastrous product that would be allowed to be sold commercially without better (and more holistic/environmental) studies.Hi Thea and thank you for your response.While i appreciate the point you are making I find it somewhat strange that while we are having this discussion on a website that attributes significant blame for the “increases in all sorts of health problems” over the last 30 years to the standard american diet, you insinuate that it might be something else. I don’t have the data, but I think you and I would both be surprised if whole food vegans, GMO or not, were included in the group with increasing health problemsAs for testing, while I’m not sure what you mean by “more holistic” testing I think there has been for than you are aware of. This is from the American Association for the Advancement of Science:“The EU, for example, has invested more than 300 million euros in research on the biosafety of GMOs. Its recent report states: ‘The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky that e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies’ ” (http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS_GM_statement.pdf)As well, while the science of GMO food is relatively recent, we have been selectively altering genes for thousands of years, in order to get from wild cabbage to broccoli, for example. Is it the method of gene alteration you oppose, then, and if so why?Thanks for your timeKrisKris: And I thank you for your response. I appreciate your approach/open tone.re: “I find it somewhat strange … blame … you insinuate that it might be something else.” Goodness, I’m not at all trying to say that all or even a large percentage of the increased health problems can be laid at the door of GMO. I’m just saying that GMOs could be responsible for or contributing to some of them. For example, it’s my understanding that there is a rash of/increase in general food allergies and sensitivities. Perhaps some of that could be related to GMOs. I don’t know. And I don’t think anyone knows one way or the other. But it is extremely plausible given the types of changes that a GMO food involves. And while I agree that the SAD diet is largely to blame for much of the issues we have seen over the last decades, eating GMOs are part of the SAD diet…re: “I’m not sure what you mean by “more holistic”” That’s fair. What I mean is testing the food as it is really eaten. I’ve heard that a great deal of GMO testing is done without real conditions. For example, testing the food itself, but not how it is really grown in commercial practice. Ie: testing without the pesticide. If the purpose of a GMO food is to allow greater application of Roundup, then testing the food grown in a lab without the Roundup doest not tell us what we need to know – how the GMO food affects human health when combined with the large roundup dose.I mean more than just that though. I’m talking about synergy effects. People don’t just eat a single food. People eat a range of foods. We know that there can be interactions between foods that exacerbate problems. (For example, see Dr. Greger’s recent video about how eating meat with white rice can make the effects of the meat even worse. White rice by itself may not be a problem. But eating white rice with meat…) The GMO foods need to be tested/understood in the context of how people actually eat them. I could see how a modified protein in a plant may be fine by itself, but when combined with another plant or meat that is maybe often used with that GMO plant, then maybe we have a problem. I don’t know. Maybe not. But given that we are talking about something so basic to life as *food*, it needs to be tested.re: “… more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research and involving more than 500 independent research groups…” The devil is in the details. It’s my understanding (which could be wrong!) that those studies do not usually involve human studies. And especially not long term human studies. In other words, 25 years of research does not necessarily mean a study that lasts 25 years. It could just mean 25 studies that each took a year. Or whatever. You get my point hopefully. When it came to figuring out the problems with smoking, we had to do long term human studies. There was nothing else that could tell us whether or not smoking was harmful to humans.re: ” Is it the method of gene alteration you oppose…?” Sort of. But I don’t think it is the right question. What we are doing in the lab with the GMOs is beyond what can be done in nature. That change from wild cabbage to broccoli may have been controlled or accelerated by humans, but it is still something that could very well have happened through evolution. With GMO’s, they are throwing in genes from other species, sometimes even non-plant species (put fish DNA in plant X…) and seeing what sticks. We are changing the chemistry of the plants in fundamental ways that would never occur naturally. And these changes are not about making the plant more palatable, but about say making the plant produce poisons or more poisons. The point of the objection is not that a “gene” was involved. But that the effect of the new chemistry of the plant on human, animal and planetary health after the artificial gene changes take place is not understood. It’s not a fear of genes or artificial genes that I have. It is a fear of changing the proteins and carbs and other pieces of the plant in a way that our bodies may not be able to process in a healthy way.Sorry the post is so long. I have a very hard time articulating my thoughts on this subject. If you stopped reading long before this, I would certainly understand. ;-)Hi Thea, and thanks again for the time you took to respond. It sounds to me like we are coming from different sides on this argument and we could go on and on. In general, i just think you are underestimating the amount of regulation that is already in place. Especially when you say “they are throwing genes from other species….. and seeing what sticks”. If it doesn’t “stick” then it won’t be approved. Adverse unintended consequences are noted and the GE process in question is not commercialized.This is a quote from a book a book called Tomorrow’s Table, that kind of simplifies the argument, for me anyway: “Unlike flouirde or some types of synthetic or organic pesticides such as rotenone, which are unquestioningly lethal to animals at high concentrations, GE traits are composed of the same chemical building blocks (DNA and proteins) that we eat every day…. in other words the fluoridated toothpaste on your toothbrush or the soft drinks in your refrigerator likely present greater risks to your health than the GE papaya you had for breakfast” (p87). Maybe you don’t consume flouirde or soft drinks, but you get the point. Millions do consume them without concern. (As pertains to our discussion here, I recommend chapter 7 of that book, if you happen to come across it)You can argue that every food contains some sort of risk, I just happen to think there is a greater chance of me choking on an organic apple than being harmed by eating a GE potato.Thanks again for the discussionKrisHow much of the pesticide residue can you wash off?Looks like that might be covered in the next video?From the Doctor’s Note above:“Here’s what to look forward to next:How to Make Your Own Fruit and Vegetable Wash Are Organic Foods Healthier? Are the Benefits of Organic Food Underrated or Overrated?”Dr. Greger produced a video on the subject call Can Pesticides Be Rinsed Off? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-pesticides-be-rinsed-off/Nothing was said here about “safe” levels of pesticide absorption. I think it’s a salient point. Obviously, in a perfect world, there would be no pesticides or chemicals anywhere, but in the world I live in there are. Some of them I worry about, some not so much, even though I never buy household chemicals. The stuff on my food? Well, here’s where it gets political. Does this study mean that only the people who can afford organic get to be healthy? The implication, correct me if I’m wrong, is that if you aren’t middle class and educated about food, then you are at risk of getting some horrible cancer.the studies he cited did not appear to differentiate vegetarians, vegans, meat eaters, so my assumption would be a sizable proportion of meat and dairy consumed in the study which would indicate higher differences than in a totally vegan population since animals concentrate toxins.plus of course, there will be a whole new level of research beyond organic where it is not just the absence of pesticides, but the presence of the full complement of soil microbes providing complete nutrition to the plant through the soil food web naturally. Organic standards need revisiting and there is another whole level of health beyond just eliminating pesticides, herbicides, etcIn these studies it seems they didnt look for organic pesticides in the blood and urine, some of them are more toxic than synthetic ones, most organic products have these “organic pesticides”~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vja9KauBb3I https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ggEe4OwSMcI heard that organic pesticides are less regulated and can cause risks. As a lot of poison in nature would be classed as organic. So how do we know that Organic pesticides are not dangerous?Stephen Lucker Kelly: re: “So how do we know that Organic pesticides are not dangerous?” It’s my understanding that some organic pesticides *are* dangerous. I still choose organic in general, because we know that in general/overall organic is less dangerous than conventional. I don’t know which specific practices. Just in general, it appears organic is more likely to be a safer choice. To somewhat support what I am saying, here is a quote from one of Dr. Greger’s blog posts some time ago:“A new study calculated that if half the U.S. population ate just one more serving of conventional fruits and vegetables, 20,000 cases of cancer could be prevented. At the same time the added pesticide consumption could cause up to 10 extra cancer cases. So by eating conventional produce we may get a tiny bump in cancer risk, but that’s more than compensated by the dramatic drop in risk that accompanies whole food plant consumption. Even if all we had to eat was the most contaminated produce the benefits would far outweigh any risks.” from: http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/25/apple-peels-turn-on-anticancer-genes/Dr. Greger’s point is to put the issue into perspective and to hope that people will not inflate the dangers of eating conventional crops. But the quote also acknowledges that there is some added danger of overall eating of conventional crops even without knowing which specific practices in organic are safe or not. And that quote above is just about one serving of fruits or veggies.If you add in the additional consideration of harm to the planet and harm to farm workers, that puts me firmly in the court of eating organic when I can, even knowing that sometimes an organic food may not be any better than it’s conventional counter part.Just some thoughts for you.I agree it would seem that organic is the safer option. My point is that if Organic pesticides cause as many problems when sprayed on crops as non-organic, then maybe it isn’t as helpful as we assumed, as there isn’t much data on organic pesticides then we don’t really know. However a lot of organic farmers on the small scale don’t actually use pesticides they use copper sprays in some cases and keep an eye on things if anything seems to get out of control they handle it. But that is when they’re a small farmer with time to keep on top of everything not a corporate organic who just switch out the synthetic chemicals they spray for organic ones and then it’s business as usually. It really depends on who you buy from so that is why it’s so important to know what the farmers do.Where I live, in one of the most unhealthy states in the US I have little choice but to buy conventional produce, except for carrots, broc and one time a bag of potatoes. I’m concerned about potatoes the most since I eat a lot of them. From what I read they’re sprayed with herbicides, pesticides and fungicides and it can’t be washed off..Grrr And plenty of beans. I wonder how clean they are?I wonder what produce the kids ate? The dirty apples, strawberries, grapes and celery etc, or the cleaner pineapple, cantaloupe, kiwi, grapefruit and cabbage?And can we ask for a pesticide test at our next Dr visit and blood work test to see how contaminated our diet really is?Sur you can ask for a pesticide test, good luck getting insurance to pay for it…Which is the unhealthiest state in the union anyways? Mississippi has the highest rates obesity and Alabama the highest rate of type 2 diabetes, but both states have at least one Whole Foods Market. I guess I am just spoiled living in California where the produce is excellent.The Environmental Working Group tests conventionally grown produce for chemical contaminants and publishes the Clean 15: http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/clean_fifteen_list.phpAnd the Dirty Dozen: http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/dirty_dozen_list.phpBut from your posting it would seem as if you are already familiar with their work. If you eat lots and lots of beans, have you considered purchase dried organic beans in bulk from an internet dealer?Hi Joe, I’ve lived on a mountain in West Virginia for the past 10 yrs. It’s a 25 mile round trip to the nearest Walmart. If they don’t have what I want then I go without..lol I believe WV is a leader in obesity, diabetes, smoking and coal lung related diseases, the least education, the poorest diet and exercise, and the highest unemployment.But I didn’t move here for all that…lol I was interested in the less crowds, crime, low property cost and very low property taxes (paid $190 last yr) cleaner air from hardly any traffic jams, or industrial air pollution.I came from the Houston area where the air was choked with smog from a few million cars, and about 60 chemical plants and oil refineries. They have a very high new bridge going over Baytown that is at the perfect level to suck in all the fumes from the smoke stacks of the 60 plants below. Every time I go visit I feel like I should have brought my gasmask because before I get to LaPorte my eyes are burning and my throat is raw…just like old times there….lol So I make due here in sleepy WV and shock the locals with my very strange diet and exercise.Hi Gary, Sounds nice. Where is the ‘best’ section of WV to move to? Retired and getting tired of NYC…Hi Dommy Bluefield is not bad. Nice and quiet, views of mountains and cheap home prices, not too far from the larger city of Beckley. Not too hot in the summer and winter is not too cold either. Or look around Beckley or Oak Hill if you want if you want to be close to medical facilities, new car dealers and some restaurants..Appreciate it, friend.I recently looked at the child asthma rates around Dallas and Houston for a family member.Some of the TX folks are starting to get upset about choking on the fracking gas, drinking water pollution and petro chemical air pollution, along with the nearby states that have to suck it up. Too bad more is on the way via the Keystone pipeline.Do more than the minimum. No more paper exercises. Go further than required. (We’re looking for more than a “goal seek” solution.)Aim the plan where smog pollution is worst: Tarrant, Denton, Wise, and Parker Counties. (Asthma rates for children under 14 are THREE TIMES HIGHER (22%) in western DFW area than across the state of TX!)The Houston area,Janczak is one of 25 million Americans who suffer from asthma, but what distinguishes her and other rural residents in the Houston region — which has the highest prevalence of asthma in Texas — is that, despite her best efforts, she still has ended up in the hospital three times.A Houston Chronicle analysis of state health records found that rural Cleveland in Liberty County has the highest rate of hospitalization for asthma-related conditions in the 10-county region. In the Houston area overall, nearly 10,000 people were hospitalized between 2007 and 2009 for asthma, according to data provided by the Texas Department of State Health Services.Well Gary. You just keep on setting a good example and keep shocking your neighbors with your strange diet and exercise habits. You can invite them over for a bean and dumpling stew, and show them just how tasty a vegan diet can be. You just might learn them a thing or two. ;)Yeah Walmart, I’ve seen what their produce looks like in some of their Illinois and Indiana stores, and it was no bargain for either quality or variety. I couldn’t vouch safe for So. Cal. where I live because have better alternatives so I never go, or West Virginia where I have only driven through to hike the Appalachian Trail. It’s hard to imagine what depth they would plumb without competition.A West Virginia mountain top retreat could definitely be an upgrade to Houston depending on your proximity to the surrounding mining operations and your source of drinking water.Perhaps you can organize a farmer’s markets if there aren’t any near by. I imagine that their is some agricultural activity going on somewhere around your domicile. Good LuckI guess it would be worth buying organic vegetables, or growing your own after all ! Sometimes we’re given the impression that there is not a big difference , but having this data helps a lot.I grow a LOT of my own food – organically. For my wife and i and sell a few. I do use some organic insecticides when needed. I try to avoid them and do most of the time. But i would rather use a little organic or non-organic insecticides for that matter than go to the store and buy conventinal grown food which will have a lot more pesticides on it than i use. {I cannot afford to buy organic from the store.} I build my soil which makes the plants healthier which protects them. Insects like the sick plants. I use row cover over a lot of my plants to keep the insects off which saves from having to spray. By growing my own we get good food and the pleasure of growing them !!!I also do some gardening. The cherry tomatoes and hot peppers do best without any trouble other than deer eating some tomato leaves. Not so good with the kale and collard greens. Had a major problem with slugs and then some bugs in late summer. I hate slugs, but I got their population way down by using RAID ROACH spray on them. They would come out in the daytime when it’s cloudy and raining and crawl on the propane tank and house siding. I’d grab my can of RAID and give them a shot and they would soon fall off and turn into a pile of goo……yuck, nasty things.Start your Kale and Collards in late summer and after the weather turns cold you will no longer have the problem with the insects. And the greens will last way up into the winter, depending on where you live and the severity of the winter.Thanks for the growing tip Alan. Last yr I trimmed the kale back to a nub and it sprouted nicely this yr on it’s own. So far no bugs are out yet, just robins sitting on their eggs under the front and back porches. I’ll see how long all is going well here lasts.If a child has a developmental disorder can some of the symptoms like attention span , dyspraxia (motor and verbal apraxia) and sensory problems be reduced by eating organic or is it pretty much hard wired and therefore irreversible?A little off topic here,Tennessee school kids were served freezer meat from 2009—and in some cases children possibly ate pork roast almost as old as they are.Hawkins County officials acknowledged its cafeterias dished out the flaky, six-year-old slabs last week, after a lunchroom worker at an elementary school leaked photos of the mystery meat.Parent and county commissioner Michael Herrell told a local TV station that primary-school cooks decided against forking over the ancient grub. The cuts, however, slipped into other schools, including Cherokee High School.http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/30/schoolkids-served-six-year-old-lunchmeat.htmlAre organic foods more nutritious? If one goes by taste, then the answer is yes.A strawberry that taste like a strawberry is more nutritious than a strawberry that taste more like cardboard.If we go by the Brix value, the answer is yes. A strawberry that is farmed well, taste better.If we go by the pesticide load, the answer is yes. A strawberry that has a lower pesticide load taste better.If we go by the hybridization kind vs the wild ugly looking kind, then the answer is yes. The wild, ugly looking kind are much tastier. (There’s nothing wrong with a pretty looking strawberry, as long as the taste is there! And, a nutrient dense berry taste better!)Some of it maybe perception and some of it may be experience, but just the idea of eating a wild or organically grown strawberry taste better.And, some of it may just be the Brix value.The best tasting oranges I’ve had in over 20 years were wild. They were ugly looking, from a tree that was left alone to grow in the soil in someone’s back yard. The were dense, sweet, dark orange, and acid (had both the sweet and sour). You could taste the vitamin C.(If you’ve ever wondered what flavor sweet tarts were trying to fake your body out in getting, that’s right, vitamin C! If they wanted to find out how to improve the flavor of sweet tarts, they would use wild oranges and put the nutrition back in! (And of course, not tell anyone)).There’s a saying that says nothing tastes as good as feeling healthy. The healthy you are, the better you feel and the better food tastes! .I rather have pesticides ON my food (I can wash before eating) than INSIDE (Genetically Modified) my food.Veganrunner: Thanks!! The volunteers no longer have moderator functions for this site and it was the moderator functions that allowed me to efficiently see everyone’s comments so I could reply when appropriate. I still see some comments, but most of them are on older pages. And then every once in a while, I am able to comment on a new page too, like this time.Thanks for your nice note!! And sorry for the rudeness you got. I knew you had it covered, but I couldn’t let it go. It’s best to get people straightened out right away–when they are open to it.Oh man we need all the support we can get. I wonder what the thinking was with that decision? Oh well. Don’t go too far!On the road again: How to survive in hotel USAmericaI bet some has already written a book about this but here goes. I am on my yearly trip to the USA. I’ll be working here for about 3 weeks. My room has a bar fridge, a microwave and the weirdest way of making coffee i’ve ever seen.step 1. take out all the booze and crap out of the fridge and put in a walmart bag.step -1. go to walmart and by a pyrex dish about 150 to 200 mm across with a lid.Step 3, i mean +2, oh crap, … go to the veg section and find the bags of pre-prepared veg. get 2 or 3 of those (not the lettuce kind, but you know what you need. Also grab a bag of pink grapefruit (which you can eat now because you don’t take the weird medicine they tried to addict you onto), a couple of those really great looking spuds (check for solanine) and also get some corn on the cob. and anything else that is whole food/plantbased of course.step next… go to the isle with spices and get some dried onions, chilli pepper flakes, black pepper and turmermeric. Get some rolled oats or similar. get some fresh berries/fruit in season type thing.then go to a healthy store that has eden soy or faux milk of your choice….DO NOT FALL FOR something called Silk…its a sugar water icky thing.Go back to your room carrying bags and bags of food. Smile as the desk person looks at you like “Hey, thats not pizza and beer!”OK, You get it by now. I can’t get over the onslaught of junk food here. I see USA in snapshots each year. And each year it gets so much worse. This morning as I went out to fix a cuppa tea, the woman in front of me was so pathologically obese, trying to make her coffee and push her cart…in looked at the floor to hide my gaze and saw her immensely swollen legs…and the others, also obese but not quite so, with their looks of disgust. I could not stop myself from putting a gentle arm around her and offer to help her. She said thanks, said sorry and carried on on her own. I think she was 30 something. Every step was accompanied with a small gasp of pain.It is heart breaking here, just south of Chicago. Next stop is Winston-Salem. Gosh how I hope its better there…but I don’t expect much. USA, from your biggest fan… please try to find some way out of this horror. I beg you..we need you to be strong…you are the worlds great country. However, like the lead in the plumbing of apocrophal Rome, the collapsed societies essentially exhausted their own designs, and were unable to adapt to natural diminishing returns for what they knew as their method of survival. I’m trying to say Open Your MFing Eyes.Also, um … if you haven’t seen “Big Bang Theory” it is really hilarious. But don’t watch anything else on TV ok?Rhombopterix: Amusing post. But also sad. I often wonder how America/Americans look to outsiders and then cringe at the speculation. re: “And each year it gets so much worse.” That’s my fear. On the other hand, I think we have an up swelling of healthy eating too. It’s like we have a split country – not just in politics, but in our eating. re: “Please try to find…” We’re working on it. As I’m sure you can imagine, we are fighting a tough battle since government, the medical profession, etc are all pretty entrenched.re: Big Bang Check! ;-)Yesterday, my young technician promised me he was starting WFPB…Asked some good questions. There is hope. I should always stay positive. YOU Thea help me do that. and others but so good to see your name here. ThanksYesterday my boss and i had a biznis dinner. Our waitress figured out my WF status and helped me construct an order that aligned sorta (a kind of bean burger wrap, hold the cheese type thing). “I’m vegetarian too she winked” Yeah!!!Rhombopterix: Such nice feedback. You have totally made my day. Thank you.You tell stories very well. Sounds like a really good waitress. Best of luck to you!So I have been following this series on Organic Food with great interest. What I want to know is whether or not the studies where the people were fed regular pesticide produced food one week and then organic the next and back to conventional the third week whether or not the people washed their produce or not? I like that you did a talk on washing the produce and what is effective. Did the graphs that were shown in this video show the amounts left in the food after it was washed?Please remember what the lawyers call the risk of living and work on the big risks first. Such as before getting the possibly dangerous pesticides out of our diet, make sure that you are not smoking, that you are getting proper exercise, and that you are already on a state of the art vegan diet. Just eating animal products is clearly a lot more dangerous than residual pesticides.Can anyone tell me the source of the organic foods used in these tests? did the food come from China where the organic food labeling has been falsified? Could it have come from Mexico whose organic standards I do not trust? For instance, last year I bought a package of organic Driscoll strawberries, grown in Mexico, that were delicious. The next week I bought another, they were not tasty and I noticed they had no rich strawberry smell. In fact, they smelled exactly like conventional strawberries, nothing to them. Strawberries will taste like they smell. When you go to the store next time, do the sniff test, organic versus conventional. I would love for you to investigate further. Not only that, but consider also the freshness of each item. Was the organic food 3 days old as opposed to the conventional maybe 1 day old. There are ways to manipulate the data.Can someone take a look at this study and tell me how this conclusion could possibly be right??? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20685950?dopt=AbstractPlusI don’t understand, however, the dip when children were fed with organic foods. Day one decreased exponentially, day two also did, and day three was the lowest point, why did the levels start to rise in days four and five, then? I don’t think their bodies “expected” the rise of pesticides.Also, that is with exposure of pesticides, what about washing your fruits in the first place? LolDiego: I don’t understand your question/point, but I think you are saying/assuming that washing fruits and vegetables removes all of the pesticides. This is not true, especially the way most people wash. There is a group called the Environmental Work Group (EWG) which evaluates how much pesticides are left on foods *after* the food is prepared the way that most people would prepare them. In other words, if most people would wash an apple before eating it, EWG does the analysis of the pesticides on the apple after it is washed. If most people would peel an orange, then they peel the orange before doing the analysis. Etc.And what they found is that there are still pesticides left on those conventional veggies even after washing. Here’s a link if you want more info: http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/faq.php#question_9Thanks. The first comment was made because the levels of any exogenous chemical in children should remain low if they’re not ingesting said chemical. You expect that from any vitamin to any pesticide. However, the graphs show the levels of said chemicals to increase PRIOR the ingestion of said chemical. Either that or the graph isn’t showing what I thought.Diego: I don’t understand your question/point, but I think you are saying/assuming that washing fruits and vegetables removes all of the pesticides.

Were the levels of those pesticides measured as well?I have the same question…Yes organic foods are safer to do the xenoestrogenic compounds in non-organic foods.It’s also not as simple as washing the pesticides off your food, it’s a matter of the pesticides leaking into the soil and your foods growing in bad soil.Here’s an article I wrote on the topic. As a Registered Dietitian who serves on two organic farming boards, I recommend making the organic choice to protect not only our personal and family health, but also farm worker health, water and air quality. http://mosesorganic.org/benefits-of-organic/I have a question regarding organic meat and stuff like that. A friend of mine was arguing that conventional animal product may be unhealthy, but that’s why he only eats organic grass-fed beef, milk and free range chicken and eggs. He also argued that as the case with conventional veggies and fruits being full of pesticides, the same goes with conventional meat so it isn’t about being vegan to be healthy; it’s about eating organic and as “nature” intended it to be (for example: cows should eat grass, not grains and soy). I showed him some of your articles and videos but he says that most of these studies compare conventional meat instead of the more healthier organic alternative. That made me think whether there were any studies that refute what he claims.Thanks!There is one study that found less multi-drug resistant bacteria contamination on organic chicken, compared with conventional chicken. The difference was not huge. For eggs, here is information about free-range vs. conventional eggs and cholesterol. I think organic anything is a better choice, but it seems the same amount of cholesterol and saturated fat are found in organic animal products.","['ADHD', 'ALS', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'antibiotics', 'birth defects', 'brain disease', 'brain health', 'brain tumors', 'Camplyobacter', 'cancer', 'chicken', 'children', 'dementia', 'food poisoning', 'foodborne illness', 'leukemia', 'meat', 'memory', 'organic foods', ""Parkinson's disease"", 'pesticides', 'pregnancy', 'reproductive health', 'Salmonella', 'superbugs', ""women's health""]",Organic food consumption appears to reduce exposure to pesticide residues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.,"This is the second of a 5-part video series on organic versus conventional foods.

Perhaps a high intake of monounsaturated fat would also contribute to insulin resistance over time, but not to the same severity as saturated fat?Never mind. I just watched your previous video explaining the different fats. Thanks!The diabetes patients in my family just do not know this information. They firmly believe they can eat all the protein and accompanying fat as long as they stay away from the dreaded carbs. When they do eat carbs, they go off the wagon and have sugary treats instead of the banned potatoes and whole grains. Even though they are becoming more obese and their diabetes is progressing, their blood sugar reports are good convincing them that what they are doing is working. Two of them are in danger of having amputations. I will send them this video, but they would rather follow the Paleo diet than learn sound nutritional science. As long as they keep their sugars down, their doctors tell them they are doing great! Unbelievable!!BB, I’m so hoping that one day we see a comment from you indicating that you got through to your family. I can imagine going about disease progression apathetically when it just involves more pills or injections, but amputations?? It’s hard to believe that the risk of that isn’t so terrifying to make someone try having some meatless spaghetti for dinner. Do you have any contact info for their doctors? Maybe you could send some information directly to them. Sounds like they could use the education.If their doctors would adopt the nutritional science approach and give the recommendations, I am sure it would influence and help my family members. But, my family members are so attached to their beliefs, habits and traditions surrounding food, I am not sure they could ever make the necessary changes. .This is my husband’s family and my husband had to have a heart attack eleven years ago before he adopted the McDougall program and became the healthy individual he is today. We do live away from the family and are not embedded in all the unhealthy family gatherings. I am not sure my husband would have been so successful if he had lived around his family. They are all obese and have chronic nutritional diseases. We are the oddballs and it is interesting that they admire our health, respect what we do, but cannot put 2 and 2 together for themselves. At times, heartbreaking!Hi BB, yes your families beliefs are a major influence on decision to eat healthy, as a convert to the Seventh Day Adventist faith I have reaped incredible benefits from the health message that is a major strength of this faith and has blessed my life. All the best and God blessMost people have a misperception of what a “Paleo diet” is. Paleo diets are not at all what the Atkins diet was 10 years or so ago i.e., its not all the protein & fat you want. In fact, its a pretty well balanced approach (depending on whose interpretation of Paleo that is) consisting mostly of fresh non starchy veggies – the largest portion of your meal, a small amount of low fat protein, small amount of nuts, seeds & healthy fats, and a small amount of fruit. It excludes all processed foods, most processed grains & sugary drinks.Maybe the reason people have misinterpretations of what a “Paleo diet” is, is because, as you pointed out, what the diet contains seems to be open to the individual Paleo-dieter’s interpretation. A whole-foods, plant-based diet is more definitive.True, there are several “versions” of Paleo. Frankly, I think the term is a misnomer, and I don’t follow it. Then I saw one author’s recommendations, and found it quite reasonable and balanced. Its not 100% vegan, but when compared to the SAD, Atkins, even the Mediterranean diet, it looked pretty well balanced and more importantly, sustainable.I tend to prefer a slightly lower carb vegan/plant based diet, with cruciferous, leafy green, and allium vegetables providing most of my carbs, with sweet potatoes of varieties contributing to a few meals a week. I don’t avoid starchy vegetables and grains, but I certainly don’t seek them out. Protein comes mainly from legumes in various forms, and I find the supportive evidence for lauric rich fats (coconut oil) strong enough that it has become my sauté oil of choice. I suppose you could call this on the edge of paleo-vegan, I don’t. More like a carb-conscious plant based diet. It has allowed me to drop about 100 pounds over the last year (portion control and calorie intake consciousness), pretty much put my Type 2 diabetes on the back-burner (where it will hopefully remain, as it has since my becoming vegan about 3 years ago). I find this video fascinating, and the paleo-diet discussions as usual a bit overly dramatic.baggman744, rephrasing your description of Paleo, the largest portion of my meal has very low caloric content and then I can have small portions of the high-calorie stuff. If I need to consume 3000 calories a day at my activity level, where do those calories come from?Agree. I’m not vegan, and I still weight train, so calorically dense foods are a part of my diet. Yeah, I know there are vegan body building websites, but that wouldn’t work for me. How does one get 3000 KCals of broccoli? You’d need a wheel barrel…Beans, grains, nuts, seeds, whole-grain bread–that’s how you get larger calorie amounts. You can’t possibly eat enough fresh vegetables to rack up lots of calories, but vegans need to eat more than just fresh vegetables!Boiled potatoes, rice, bread, etc. all are full of calories and they go well with beans, tomato, raisins, etc…. Vegan diet is full of calories. If you insist on Oil, there is olive and vegetable oil.Paleo is morphing into many varieties as it enters the mainstream vernacular.True. Perfect example, look Atkins 10 years and today, very different. Like most things in diet trends/ popularity / nutritional recommendations, it’ll always be dynamic. As I’ve said, to me therm “Paleo” itself is a misnomer, but we (consumers) tend to like labels And for those “selling it”, it works, if for no other reason, marketing purposes.Exactly! I never thought I’d see the day when that would be Atkins branded TV dinners in the frozen food section! Paleo is showing signs of going the same route.Well “paleo” can really be branded like Atkins is. What I meant was, Atkins used to be all the butter, lard, and fat you want. Its come a long way since the death of Dr. Atkins, and the brand was sold by his family.Have them get their fasting insulin checked regularly–that will tell them what is REALLY going on! Since Type 2 Diabetes is a disease of insulin resistance from too much insulin, the lower the fasting insulin levels, the better. Most practitioners recommend fasting insulin below 10, with ideal at 3-5.Julie, Since the body’s pancreas and liver systematic functions of glucose storage, insulin and glucagon release, and systemic insulin resistance is reflected in fasting blood glucose measures, why not just measure/monitor morning blood glucose levels?Mark, because people can have normal blood sugar levels, like BB’s relatives, and think they’re all set. Insulin resistance is the problem; high blood sugar is just a symptom. Normal blood sugars with high fasting insulin indicate metabolic syndrome, as Dr. Greger discusses in the video. https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/insulin-causes-insulin-resistance-hormonal-obesity-x/Please see the discussion above about the Newcastle protocol for reversing diabetes. Paleo/LCHF controls blood sugar, but that’s all it does. Whereas, the program Prof. Roy Taylor has tested actually restores normal pancreatic function.With diabetes statistics looking unfavorably for people in my age group, this sort of information and this sort of website is invaluable. Watching these videos always gives me the feeling I’m on the ground floor of important information in the nutrition field. And it’s because of Dr. Greger and his staff and volunteers. Thank you, all of you.Ditto on the ‘Thanks to Dr. Greger and his staff and volunteers’. This valuable information from this website is the primary reason I changed my eating habits to Whole Foods – Plant Based!I took a look at the Standards of Medical Care document and while there’s some promising language, it’s still so pathetically inadequate. Some highlights were: recommending “at least” as much whole grains and fiber as for the general population, and recommending that carbohydrates come from fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains as opposed to processed foods with added sugars/fats.Unfortunately, they still recommend increasing fish for the omega-3s while simultaneously discouraging omega-3 supplements; insisting that there’s no conclusive evidence for an ideal fat or macronutrient levels overall, so that should be individualized based on patient “preference” and “metabolic goals”; and that fat and cholesterol levels should be the same as those for the general population, in other words, way too much. I did a search for the word “meat” and came up with zero hits in the entire document. Dairy is only mentioned as something that should be increased (once mentioned as “low fat dairy”, once simply mentioned as “dairy”). Even if the message to reduce saturated fat and cholesterol does get through to a patient, I would imagine most are going to respond to that by increasing chicken, fish, and egg white consumption. And speaking of protein, the standards of care initially state explicit instructions to not reduce protein consumption even in those with kidney disease, then later state reducing protein “might” be considered if the kidney disease is progressing to a certain degree.Even so called “good fat” in the end is fat. It’s easy to over consume fat if one uses oils in cooking and also eats a lot of nuts.This Doctor in the link below claims that meat causes diabetes.https://www.facebook.com/drgarth/posts/942670975753811My question/concern……he also claims in a reply to one of his readers that the saturated fat in coconut does not cause diabetes. This seems to go against current thinking on this website here, no? I am aware that their are (reportedly) populations of people who ingest large amounts of plant-based saturated fats that do not get diabetes, but is this just a fluke? Would a diet consisting of 40 percent of its calories from coconuts and nuts and seeds eventually increase/cause type 2 diabetes?Has anyone here been able to maintain a high carb/sugar high plant-based fat diet and not have issues? Maybe for a few years I’d think it could be OK but long-term I’d think there’d be issues.Very interesting. The Medical community will soon recommend liver transplant as a solution to this deadly epidemic :-) Diabetes is a very serious disease – you are at high risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, impotence, cancer, amputation, blindness, gastroparesis, dementia and painful polyneuropathy. Don’t expect a cure from Big Pharma – their goal is not to cure the disease, but to control it – keeping you as a patient for many years. Besides antidiabetic medication you will get antihypertensive drugs, simvastatin, an anticoagulant and antidepressant against the painful polyneuropathy. There are a lot of money in this disease. For most people type 2 diabetes is a choice. If one of your parents have the disease, and you become fat, then you will get the disease with a very high probability. Unless you do something drastic – as shifting to a mainly plant based diet. Sugar is not the culprit – high blood sugar is just the consequence. The villain is the fat. Lets call the disease by its real name: Lipotoxemia disease. You eat too much toxic fat!https://www.facebook.com/drgarth/posts/942670975753811The doctor from the link i just included here claims that coconut fat is not an issue, as it is a plant-based fat and he says that there is evidence that cultures who consume lots of coconut fat do not have the diabetes issues. Your thoughts?My first thought is that it is BS (not blood sugar !) Coconut fat contains a lot of saturated fat (Toxins or Darryl can probably tell how much ;-) ). Cultures consuming a lot of coconut fat probably base most of their diet on plants – that could be one explanation – like a flexitarian on a mostly plant based diet, but eating meat, fish or cheese once or twice pr month. Just my thoughts for what it is worth.My good friend/triathlete/bariatric surgeon Dr. Garth in Elsie’s link implies that fats vs. carbs is just a distraction. It is the animal proteins that lead to insulin resistance/diabetes. “Meat consumption is a major cause of diabetes, carbs are not.” Saturated fat only entered the discussion when the meat producers conspired to blunt the message of eat less meat and turned it into eat lean protein, accepting saturated fat as the new villain as a stand-in for animal foods. All of these diseases of excess are multifactorial, meaning that it is an exceedingly complex and varied system and you usually can’t blame just one thing when there is an endless stream of things; but meat, especially modern factory meat, embodies a broad spectrum of these causative factors: saturated fat, animal protein, heme iron, pathogens, endotoxins, antibiotics, hormones, biomagnified environmental toxins, microbiome dysbiosis, etc.Interesting. “All of these diseases of excess are multifactorial” – agree, biology is complexThat’s why magic bullets are so elusiveHi elsie, I didn’t see anything about coconut in that post? Is there a different one where he elaborates on this issue or did I miss it somehow?For what it’s worth, I think Dr. Davis is fantastic! We need more docs like him and especially on social media.Re: coconut fat, I know I’ve seen some things before about particular Pacific islanders and coconut consumption, and when you really break it down, they’re eating mostly tubers with a very small volume of coconut, maybe 20% calories from fat in the diet overall. Which is higher than e.g. an Esselstyn recommended diet, but still much lower than a standard American “low fat” diet. So with enough sweet potatoes and exercise, maybe a little extra fat isn’t the end of the world (or maybe there are in fact significant differences in long term health outcomes that aren’t being addressed), but unfortunately these nuances often get lost in translation and the average reader thinks oh goody, coconut oil ad libitum, and will surpass what the islanders were eating in total fat consumption, without incorporating all of the other health promoting diet and lifestyle factors: activity, sweet potatoes and other low fat high fiber foods, community, stress reduction, etc. Just my two cents. If you can share an actual study he’s referenced, we can look at the details more. :)Yeah, good points you make. If you read the comments toward the end of the page, you’ll see the Dr.’s comments to someone on coconut fat.from the link/page:DR. GARTH DAVIS “There is an island where they eat large quantities of coconut and do not appear to have diabetes. Saturated fat is a major culprit but no the kind in coconuts”QUESTION: do you recommend avoiding nuts, seeds and avocados because of their high fat content? In the “rant” you often speak about “fat” – can one assume that you are, in general, referring to animal sources of fat, and not to plant sources? Because of the recent data coming out of the Adventist HS-2 (vegans who consume nuts and seeds regularly end up living 7-8 years longer than vegans who do not), I have been enjoying flaxseeds, walnuts, pecans, cashews, pumpkin seeds, poppy seeds on a daily basis. Might these fatty foods lead to insulin resistance?Also, do you know anything about the effect of whole coconut flesh (coconut butter, which is puréed whole coconut) on insulin resistance? After all, it is saturated fat – but does it have the same effect as animal-source saturated fat? 2 · 13 hrs Dr. Garth Davis The studies I have reviewed show no harm to nuts, seeds and avocados. I include them in my diet. I caution patients on the calorie content however. 2 · 13 hrs DR. GARTH DAVIS “There is an island where they eat large quantities of coconut and do not appear to have diabetes. Saturated fat is a major culprit but no the kind in coconuts”Dr. Greger has a few thoughts on coconut and I am planning to update any new research in the Ask the Dietitian section, as this is always a hot topic. In the meantime, here are a few notes from Dr. Greger’s video on coconut oil. I took this straight from the transcripts.“Walter Willett’s recommendation from Harvard, if you are going to use it use it sparingly. Now look, if you’re eating so healthy that your LDL cholesterol is under 60 or 70, then I don’t see coconut oil as a problem. Unlike saturated animal fats, coconut oil doesn’t cause that spike inflammation immediately after consumption of animal foods, which makes sense because as you’ll remember it may be the dead bacterial endotoxins in animal products ferried into the body by saturated fat that are to blame. ”There are 3 videos in the “Doctor’s Note” section that discuss animal fat and endotoxins. I think they may helpful. More to come on this…Thanks , JosephThis seems to be the consensus. Without mentioning any names, two respected Harvard grads, one an MD/ researcher & author, the other a respected nutritionist & author whose recommendations I trust, share this exact opinion. I’ve never bought into the whole “miracle of coconut oil” thing, never used it, don’t see a reason to start.Yes, I would agree with Dr. Davis and others that nuts, seeds, coconut, and avocado can certainly play a beneficial role in a healthy diet, and being plants, certainly they all have unique phytonutrients, but of course as he mentions, watch the calories. This is an area where I definitely think individual considerations are warranted. For those seeking rapid heart disease reversal, or having trouble losing weight, restricting them might be for the best. For others, they might provide unique health benefits. I think everyone should eat mindfully, and watch their own weight, cholesterol levels, insulin levels, etc, and do what appears to keep them happiest and healthiest. One thing I think does need to be treated with caution is qualitative wording like “large quantities”, for reasons stated in previous comment. Americans certainly have their own unique perspectives on what “large quantities” are, and also as MacSmiley mentions, coconut itself and the currently super trendy coconut oil are very different foods.The coconut-centered cultures with little or no diabetes (Kitavans?) eat whole food coconut, not gobs of coconut oil.………and they don’t sit in front of a TV or a computer all day; they engage in physical labor 8-12 hours a day.Yeah, I’m inclined to believe that the coconut oil fat is not so good as well. I think Darryl has commented on this before, and I gather he knows what he is talking about. The only thing that makes me pause, though, is I meet a fair amount of seemingly healthy and fit people who costume a fair amount of saturated fats. I think that the benefit that coconut has going for it is that it is not too high in omega 6, and the other plant-based fats in nuts and avocados can, in excess of omega 3 fats, cause issues.I just stick with the science and chalk anecdotes up as diversions. It really doesn’t matter that sometimes some people claim to eat some saturated fat and have the outward appearance that someone might consider healthy, does it? I believe we are beyond that now.Stories of someone’s great grandmother living to 102 smoking cigarettes, eating eggs and bacon for breakfast, or doing a shot of whisky every day only make me wonder how long they would have lived if they had not done those unhealthy things.Alas, science contradicts itself a lot! There is scientific proof that low carb is healthier then high carb and vice versa. Plant proteins are better than meat proteins BUT meat has B12 so you have to supplement if you’re eating only plants. So eat some meat every now and then? Some plant fats are good (avocado) some are bad just like some animal fats. I prefer to eat as much variety as possible: some veganistic, fish and meat.I think evidence is different than “proof”, that “science” doesn’t answer questions like “is high carb healthier than low carb”, and that contradictory evidence means our understanding is incomplete rather than being an indictment of “science”.Having said all that, I would much rather make dietary decisions based on today’s knowledge than the knowledge we had 20 years ago or more. I certainly wouldn’t decide today, for example, that I needed to eat meat because it contains B12. B12 is created by bacteria, and we have to get it from alternative sources due to modern hygiene and living standards. This is not evidence that meat is required for health or survival. It is evidence that we can have profound impacts on our environment. But we already know that.I think that if you do some research you will find out that a lot of meat eaters are low on B12. It is not just Vegans that have the problem.Yes, I know that the older you get the less able you are to get B12 out of your food. And of course meat is not the only source of B12: yeast (inacitvated) is also a great source of B12. And of course science of today can be very helpful. Still every now and then practical wisdom from long ago gets attention as science (finally) sees the evidence of it. People and apes always have ben eating nuts, seeds etc. Eating no or hardly any fatty veggies or fruit (avocado) is just not a good idea.The best and most extensive review of coconut oil on the internet is probably this one done by the American Heart Association, they do address why it probably should be limited: http://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/uploads/Evidence_paper_coconut_August_2014.pdfSo, the question now becomes, if we have fat invading our organs, how do we get the fat back out? If I drop 50lbs, how do I make sure those first 50lbs are the organ and muscle fat? Is the body protective of that fat or does it give it up first?Hi Mike, I assume from your name that you’re vegan, so the good news is that if we accept the principle that ectopic fat stores are the underlying cause of the disease, and if we look to the results (i.e. those on low fat vegan diets with unrestricted carbohydrate intake are able to reduce or even eliminate insulin dosage) it follows as a reasonable conclusion that ectopic fat stores are in fact being reduced by such a diet.Speaking solely of weight loss in itself, it appears that hepatic lipids are mobilized first, followed by visceral, subcutaneous abdominal, and then skeletal muscle lipids. Reduction in skeletal muscle lipids may have been the lowest, however it is still a significant reduction:“[…] ~27 kg weight loss improved both hepatic as well as peripheral insulin sensitivity. The largest reduction occurred in hepatic TG content (−85%), whereas IMCLs accumulation in the skeletal muscle decreased by 38%. The relative reduction in visceral fat was larger than the reduction in subcutaneous abdominal fat (−60% and −45% resp.) (accepted for publication in Obesity [98]).” [http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ije/2012/983814/]Studies from the above review are mostly dealing with results from low calorie or very low calorie diets; if the studies referenced are in line with American standard dietary recommendations for diabetics, then the fat content by caloric percentage may be 3-5 times higher than what a low fat vegan diet would provide. It sure would be nice to see the results of hepatic/skeletal muscle/etc lipid mobilization in a low fat vegan diet trial.Thanks for that information, and I will be reviewing it. Yes, I am a high carb low fat vegan switching Jan 1 of this year from a Standard American Diet. This also brings up another question. If that fat is released, where does it go? Could this be part of the cause of elevated triglycerides reported by some moving to a high carb, low fat plant based diet.If you are on a low fat vegan diet and losing weight (maybe 1/2 lb/day), and you wake up around 4 am and are really hot, that is a tipoff of where the fat is going. If your body wants to, it can burn it off while you are sleeping.Sadly, my mother did die from just this scenario. Diabetes. Liver Cancer that grew to include Bowel Cancer. Pancreatic fail. Congestive Heart Failure. Three years before she died, she said she’d rather die than give up meat. The last words she said to me the day before she died were, “I love you. Thank you for taking care of me. I’ll start eating (whole foods, vegan) like you.”wow. Oh man that hits me really hard because my mother is also not vegan. And she smokes. Those last words are almost too sad to hear. I pray I can keep her from a painful end. I sympathize with you so much friend. That is too sad.OK, so how to get rid of the fat. I did it by eating no bread, pasta, rice, sugar. Lost all my fat and kilo’s while eating nuts like almonds and pecan and seeds with chick peas etc. Now this story tells me that I must have loads of fat in my muscles? I don’t think so. I learned that sugar (carbo) is turned into fat which I can confirm for I had quite some fat in the days I was still eating a lot of bread and pasta. If I want to put on weight I only have to eat pasta for a couple of days and presto I’m getting fat again. So how come eating fat would turn me fat without me seeing it?Ectopic fat is found within skeletal muscle tissue and in and around the internal organs, e.g. the liver, pancreas, and heart. It is different from subcutaneous fat which is found just under the skin and is what most people think of when they think of the word “fat”.Ectopic fat was my beer belly :-) http://www.myhealthywaist.org/ This Canadian organization talks about that. So, it is something that shows quite clearly and I do not have it anymore. Nonetheless I eat 1 to 2 handfull of nuts/seeds a day. And use coconut oil in my coffee, a recommendation from Dr. Perlmutter http://www.drperlmutter.com/tag/coconut-oil/ I know that vitamins like A, D and E are only available in fat. I do not know of any vitamins that are only available in carbo like bread and pasta. After a week not eating bread, pasta, pizza, potatoes and rice the beer belly was almost gone :-) I feel a lot better so would I need to be eating grains again?This video almost indicates for an analysis of your fasting glucose numbers. As it indicates that the more fat stored in the muscles, the poorer the insulin response which should drive up your glucose numbers. Perhaps not high enough to be considered diabetic, but perhaps on the high side of “normal”What about paleo eaters who eat mostly animal fat and protein and do crossfit workouts? They look lean and healthy, so it’s hard to argue they aren’t. Are we worried about those folks? Is it more about excess calories or more about dietary fat?A recent video may help to answer that for you: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diets-may-negate-benefits-of-exercise/That video only deals with cholesterol and insulin levels. More important, “looking” lean and healthy is not really any indication of health at the cellular level. Many chronic diseases e.g. heart disease, cancers, degenerative diseases, etc, will not be visible just by looking at someone and seeing how many momentum propelled “pull-ups” they can do.Thanks for the reply. I refreshed myself on the video re paleo. I agree that eventually my paleo friends will have health concerns as a result of their diet. One friend sadly even went from a vegan diet to paleo because her fitness results were better. I should ask her for her cholesterol numbers. Perhaps ultimately, as vegans, we may have to accept that some athletic high fat meat dieters can have a healthy profile and physique and we elect to choose vegan for multiple reasons in addition to health. Or perhaps I should be worried about my friends (in addition to the animals and planet).So let me getting this straight. Intramyocellular lipid toxicity, a.k.a. Lipotoxicity, leads to cancer, impotence, vaginal dryness, obesity, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease, diabetes, stroke, vascular and coronary heart disease. Did I miss any? Talk about digging your own grave with your teeth.

Kudos once again, Dr. Greger.So happy to hear that! I was afraid it was going to be too academic for folks. I’m glad at least someone understood it! :)Dr. Greger does an excellent job of pulling it all together! I have been recommending this approach for the last 8 years or so… although folks like Dr. John McDougall have been having success for much longer… not to mention Dr. Walter Kempner’s work see video http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kempner-rice-diet-whipping-us-into-shape/ in the early part of 20th century. The science keeps coming but as our understanding grows it only reaffirms what works. The devil is in the details and it is a bit complicated but the take home message is clear… diabetes whole food plant based diet with adequate starches to ensure adequate calorie intake. If you eat just non starchy vegetables and fruits you don’t get enough calories. At least the message is starting to get out that the “glucose” processing problem is caused by “fats” in the diet. Jeff Novick RD was the first one I saw tie exercise to calorie density(calories/pound). It is very useful concept. It helps explains how folks like Jim Fixx can exercise, be lean and die suddenly. Lean doesn’t necessarily mean that your arterial system is healthy. The fitness helps stabilize the arteries but to stack the odds in your favor you need to eat properly. Folks can and do change but at different rates. It would be nice if the environment would encourage proper eating but that would mean government, business and especially the health care professionals would start recommending the best lifestyle approaches. Until that happens we can keep getting the information out there and leading by example. I believe referring folks to NutritionFacts.org for the latest science, Dr. McDougall’s website for those who want a more clinical perspective… see his December 2009 newsletter article on treating diabetes, and PCRM for some practical tools to help make the transition… Vegetarian Starter Kit, Nutrition for Kids, and 21 Day Kickstarter programs available in english, spanish and mandarin! Patients on medications need to work with their providers. This is especially important for patients on diabetes and high blood pressure medications. Of course it would help if health care professionals were reimbursed in a manner to support creating healthy citizens and not for visits for procedures and drugs that aren’t healthy over time. Keep tuned.‘… Fixx was genetically predisposed (his father had a heart attack at 35 and died of another at 43, and Fixx himself had a congenitally enlarged heart), and had several lifestyle issues. Fixx was a heavy smoker prior to beginning running at age 36, he had a stressful occupation, he had undergone a second divorce, and his weight before he took up running had ballooned to 220 pounds (100 kg).[6]’ –wikiThere are of course many contributing factors but Esselstyn’s work at the Cleveland clinic published last year showed it is possible to stabilize the arterial tree and almost eliminate arterial events… 0.6% over 3 1/2 years as opposed to standard medical care of 20% per year (Courage study). His study involved persons with proven coronary artery disease. Stopping smoking for 3 years returns your risk to baseline. In my clinical experience the biggest problem with stress is what patients do when under significant stress… eating and exercising typically are poorer. Given a genetic predisposition all the more reason to pursue lifestyle habits since we can’t change our genes but diet has significant effect on whether they are expressed. Be well.still…someone with a genetic predispostion doesn’t seem to be a good example to use.[..and stress does cause health problems directly, but you know that].An appropriate response would have been ‘yeah, ok, my bad’.This is great advice for diabetic patients. Most people believe that sugar and carbs are the culprits, but this shows that a high fat diet is also detrimental to their health. Not only is a low carb diet beneficial, but a low fat diet is too: http://www.aboutlowcarbfoods.org/low-carb-diet-diabetes/low-carb-diet-and-diabetes/ Will make sure to counsel my diabetic patients about a low fat diet too. Thanks Dr. G!The reason most people believe sugar and carbs are the culprits it’s because they are.What causes a bigger insulin spike, sugar/carbs, or fats? Remember, one of insulin’s primary functions is to clear glucose out of the system. Fat doesn’t create the same glucose response as sugar/carbs because there is in fact no sugar in fat. So obviously for diabetics, they want more fat in their diet than sugar/carbs.That is all you really need to know to derive any common sense from thisAMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION STANDARDS OF MEDICAL CARE IN DIABETES—2015http://professional.diabetes.org/admin/UserFiles/0%20-%20Sean/Documents/January%20Supplement%20Combined_Final.pdf‘Carbohydrate amount and available insulin may be the most important factors influencing glycemic response after eating and should be considered when developing the eating plan.‘Monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, remains critical in achieving glycemic control.’‘Carbohydrate Management- Individuals with type 1 diabetes should be offered intensive insulin therapy education using the carbohydrate counting meal planning approach (37,39,40,43,50), which has been shown to improve glycemic control’A variety of eating patterns have been shown to be effective in managing diabetes, including Mediterranean-style (53,65), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style (66), and plant-based (vegan or vegetarian) (67), lower-fat (68), and lower-carbohydrate patterns (68).’These excerpts illustrate perfectly why following the mainstream dietary recommendations for diabetes results in diabetes being considered a lifelong, incurable disease.The operative word in these guidelines is “glycemic” control. This type of diet ignores and makes no attempt to fix the underlying cause of the disease (lipid induced insulin resistance), but rather “works” by simply managing a symptom (excess carbohydrate in the blood).By promoting carbohydrate restriction, this type of diet inevitably increases insulin response and decreases insulin sensitivity due to increased protein and fat in the diet; both of which resulting in progression of the disease.These guidelines are designed perfectly to prevent people diagnosed with diabetes from actually seeing any improvement in their disease status over time. A focus only on glycemic response rather than insulin response will keep them diabetic, and most likely promote a gradual worsening of the disease over time. This is in contrast to high carbohydrate low fat nutritional intervention, which actually fixes a broken system (elevated insulin levels and interference in signal transduction) and can result in actual reversal of the disease over time.Do you think the advised ‘Mediterranean-style’ diet might also ‘fix the broken system’ in addition to improving glycemic control ?Or is high carbohydrate low fat the only path to the fix?Well first we have to define “Mediterranean” diet. In the U.S. this often means a salad with a big fillet of fish covered in feta cheese. Going back to the studies leading to the original inception of the “Mediterranean” diet concept, we see the Cretans were eating 93% of their calories from plants (largely from grains, fruits, and legumes), with approximately 3 tbsp of olive oil per day (and in addition to diet, walking approximately 8-9 miles per day on hilly ground). Certainly eating a mostly plant based diet would point a person in the right direction. Though considering the known effects of both protein and saturated fat on insulin response and function, respectively, along with the complete lack of blood sugar-modulating fiber and phytonutrients, certainly one would guess that less animal products would be better.So the remaining question in regards to the true Medi diet is that of olive oil. People often associate olive oil with unsaturated fat, but of course it is a mix of both unsaturated and saturated. 3 tbsp of olive oil offers about 6 g saturated fat, which to put in perspective is about the same amount as in a 6 oz sirloin steak. Which still, if the main source of saturated fat in the diet, is going to be much lower than the average American’s intake. However for someone like me on a low fat plant based diet, adding that to my diet could easily double or triple my intake for the day. So personally, if I already had the disease, and wanted to clean out and retool the cellular machinery as efficiently as possible, I would choose less saturated fat rather than more and leave out the oil, again based on what we know of the mechanisms of saturated fat induced insulin resistance.Since excess body fat in general is also implicated in diabetes (see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-spillover-effect-links-obesity-to-diabetes/ ), that would make me wary of adding so much (even unsaturated) fat to the diet, which would obviously increase the caloric density of the diet, making it easier to achieve a surplus of calories and prevent the reduction of body fat itself. Frankly I don’t think we have any studies testing an authentic “Mediterranean” diet for the reversal of diabetes. If we did have a true Medi diet vs truly low fat plant based diet though, my bet would be on the lower fat diet at least for speed of recovery from the disease.ok, fair enough. thanks.high carb low fat is not a fix, it’s a detriment. The American populace has been following a high-carb low fat diet since the early 80’s and they havn’t got healthier, they’ve gotten worse. No not everyone is at McDonalds, they are actually trying to abstain from fats in the diet and it’s killing them.Mediterranean diet fixes the broken system but so does paleo, and mediterranean was derived from paleo.As far as I know, American fat intake has been averaging about 80 grams per day since at least the 1970s, though it has slightly decreased as a percentage of calories basically due to an increase in consumption of junky carbs. Last I checked, most of the world was getting a greater share of their calories from carbohydrate, and a lower share from fat, than Americans.You say “..carbohydrate restriction…. inevitably increases insulin response”. How can that be? Does’nt rising(!) blood sugar leads to rising insulin which leads to storing the glucose as fat in the cells?Hi Wil, this statement was in reference to the fact that calories come from only three sources: carbohydrates, fatty acids, or proteins. By limiting one (carbohydrate), the proportion of the other two (fat, proteins, or both) will inevitably see a relative increase in the diet.See the effect of protein on insulin response here: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-white-rice-is-linked-to-diabetes-what-about-china/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diets-may-negate-benefits-of-exercise/And the effect of fat on insulin signaling pathways here: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-causes-insulin-resistance/So high fat-high protein foods (or an overall high fat/protein diet) essentially pack a one-two punch: stimulate insulin surges while simultaneously inhibiting insulin function.B00mer, your link on insulin in regards to fat is wrong. A simple experiment on your own body will tell you that.Go eat a couple of spoonfuls of olive oil and see what happens to your energy.Now go eat dougnut and see what happens to your energy.A rise in glucose causes a rise in insulin because the insulin needs to clear the glucose out of the system to acceptable levels. B00mer, what has more sugar in it, a doughnut or a olive oil? Come on, this isn’t difficult.Your own point even proved your wrong “high fat/protein diet “inhibiting insulin function”. That’s the point B00mer, it inhibits it, it slows it down so things are stored more slowly, but fat doesn’t create an insulin response, protein does. So now we have a case of a high protein/fat diet inhibiting the insulin response which is what WE want. We don’t want our insulin blowing through the roof.Where your getting stuck is you think protein/fat is causing an insulin surge which it isn’t, and I bring you back to common sense here..What has more sugar, steak or an apple? What has more sugar, chicken breast w/ olive oil or carrots? What has more sugar, Fish w/ coconut oil or a bowl of pasta?You can’t honestly sit there and think all those proteins with fats carry more sugar than the latter. So if they don’t carry as much sugar, then how are they going to carry a surging insulin response compared to their sugar-ladened counter parts?Have your forgotten what insulin’s primary jobs were? Aside from storing nutrients, its’ meant to clear glucose from our system, so how is it that you think protein/fat foods are creating a larger sugar response than the foods which actually have more sugar in them?so how is it that you think protein/fat foods are creating a larger sugar responseFirst, your comment displays an extreme lack of knowledge and understanding about a very important distinction: insulin response vs glucose response. These are inversely proportional. If you had an even minimal amount of knowledge on the subject, you would know this. Google these, learn the difference, then re-read my comment.What I said was that high protein foods induce a higher insulin response. Let’s clarify something else: I don’t “think” that they do. They do. This is observable reality, based on science. If you disagree with the use of modern scientific inquiry to obtain meaningful results to questions about the world around us, then there is nothing to discuss. I prefer to base my scientific knowledge on reality, not musings and thought experiments by non-scientist internet commenters.So now we have a case of a high protein/fat diet inhibiting the insulin response which is what WE want. We don’t want our insulin blowing through the roofI’m sorry if this sounds harsh, but again you display a complete ignorance on the subject. In your phrase “inhibiting the insulin response” you have conflated two entirely separate phenomena. Again, please google these. Use of incorrect terminology (you are in fact using things that mean the opposite of what you are intending) renders the conversation meaningless.1. There is NO inhibiting of the insulin response between fat or protein. First, protein induces an insulin surge significantly higher than fat or carbohydrate. This is science. This is real life. Accept it.2. Second, fat does not inhibit the response. Saturated fat inhibits insulin function. This is the signalling cascade that occurs within a cell upon insulin binding. This means your insulin isn’t working. This is called insulin resistance.We’re talking about the amount of insulin that is released into the bloodstream (insulin response) vs the ability of insulin to achieve the desired effect once it binds to a cell (insulin sensitivity or insulin function).You can’t honestly sit there and think all those proteins with fats carry more sugar than the latter.I never once stated or said anything that could possibly be construed to have insinuated this. Once again, you need to learn the definitions of the following terms: glucose response, insulin response, insulin sensitivity. Then you will be at least have the opportunity to make a cogent statement on the subject.A simple experiment on your own bodyWhat is this, the middle ages? Thanks, but I enjoy living in the modern scientific age.B00mer, you do realize that people who continue to suffer from diabetes are those who continue to follow a low fat / moderate to high carb diet?60 years of studies were trying to prove that low fat was the problem but every one of them failed. None were ever published and when asked they said “the results are not what they’d hoped for”What does that tell you B00mer?Bob, I don’t think it is worth having a conversation with you until you have demonstrated that you understand the key terms in the discussion.Your characterization of scientists “trying to prove” something illustrates that you don’t really understand the practice of science itself. Here is how the scientific method works: 1) make an observation about the world around you, 2) ask questions about what you see, 3) try to answer those questions.If scientists make an observation high carb low fat diets reverse diabetes, they will try to answer why and how. And that has been done. Studies have been done to see which foods induce the highest insulin surges. The answer: pure refined sugar, and meat. Studies have been done to elucidate the mechanism by which insulin resistance occurs. We now know at the cellular and molecular level how saturated fat causes this. Scientists have gone on to put people on low fat high carbohydrate diets (ad libitum, meaning completely unrestrained intake of carbohydrates), and the results are as good or better than the ADA recommend diet which restricts carbohydrates from entering the bloodstream to begin with. So clearly the high carb low fat diet is improving the ability of the body to properly and efficiently process those carbohydrates.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677007/ http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/8/1777.fullContrast the above with your approach: you have decided on your own that protein and fat reduce insulin response and increase insulin sensitivity. Despite both of these statements being factually at odds with well established and accepted basic physiological research, you cling to them and since evidence disagrees with you, you can only support them with your personal opinions and wishful thinking. Go on believing this if you want to, but if we can’t agree on the importance and existence of evidence, this isn’t a conversation worth having.Question: So when someone eats a high fat meal, the fat enters the bloodstream. From there it enters the muscle cell, hampering insulin activity in that cell. Where else does fat from the meal go? Does the excess fat travel to the liver for processing? If so, can it temporarily cause fatty liver, resulting in insulin resistance of the liver?Here is an example of what happens after consuming a high fat meal. One study explaining the pathway. See if these resources help? Dr. Greger always has great info in his “Doctor’s Note” section that may also help.Thanks, JosephThanks, Joseph. The study kind of helps. I just want to know if eating a high fat meal can cause temporary hepatic insulin resistance in a non diabetic.Oh I see. I think so. This video may help have you seen it? What Causes Insulin Resistance? This should answer your question, but double check that I am thinking right.Thanks, Julie JosephThanks, that is very useful information. The article below also indicates that high fat diets impair brain health as well as cardiovascular health. It concluded that: “Raising plasma free fatty acids decreased myocardial PCr/ATP and reduced cognition, which suggests that a high-fat diet is detrimental to heart and brain in healthy subjects.”http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/93/4/748.fullIf you’ve looked at the studies over the past 60 years, you’d find that those with cardiovascular disease were mostly people who ate a low fat diet.Care to provide some evidence for that statement? I’ve looked at plenty of studies. None of them have shown that. What they show is that people whose diets are high in saturated fat, trans fat and junk foods have a greater risk of chronic disease. Sure, a low fat diet that is high in junk (refined/processed) carbs is unhealthy but Pritikin, Esselstyn and Ornish have shown that low fat plant based whole food diets reverse cardiovascular disease.You answered your question “Fat hampers insulin activity”In order for a nutrient to be stored, it needs insulin to do so. Fat can’t be “stored” if insulin is impaired, hence why type 1 diabetics need to inject insulin so they can “store” the nutrients.If you eat a high carb / high fat meal, yes the fat can go straight to fat storage which is why it’s generally not recommended to people unless they are trying to gain weight.Fat by itself just gets converted to glucose in either your liver, small intestines, or kidney’s. It then just sits there until it gets burned off or shuttled out with insulin. It also activates the fat burning enzymes in the body. If your body doesn’t see fat coming in, it thinks it’s starving and wont burn it. Fats are usually consumed with proteins like in foods such as steak; however, the process is no different than above as fat blunts the absorption rate of protein. and thus creates a nice lasting effect of energy throughout the day.The problem with the whole Vegan approach is the low fat whole plant food diet. Fat doesn’t get stored but it doesn’t really get burned either, protein does. But because people see weight loss they think “whoohoo”; but in reality, the body will not burn fat if it’s not getting it. Fat is essential for burning fat to avoid “starvation mode”Dr. Garth Davis, a triathlete weight loss surgeon, just posted a long rant on this as well, he cites the animal protein not just the fat, replete with citations for his upcoming book: https://www.facebook.com/drgarth/posts/942670975753811 Carbs vs. fat is really just a distracting sideshow to the protein type/amountGreat info by Dr. Davis. Thanks for sharing.Well worth watching, Dr. Greger’s cited source Dr. Roy Taylor at the (LCHFThanks MacSmiley but the video is down now and behind a paywall. I have previously seen some articles about Taylor’s approach but none seem to mention protein-sparing as such. Can you elaborate? I understand that the intervention diet was liquid meal replacements and salad but it was not specifically intended to be protein-sparing as I understand it. http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/36/4/1047.full http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/12/type-2-diabetes-diet-cureSorry, Tom. I posted the link because, even though the video was only supposed to be up for 24 hours, it actually was available for several weeks. It went unavailable about an hour after I posted the link.Prof. Taylor /Newcastle University in England has posted a webpage with resources.http://www.ncl.ac.uk/magres/research/diabetes/reversal.htmThis is exciting work. Most diets aim to control blood sugar in the seru most diets aim to control fasting blood sugar and A1C. LCHF does this, but does not cure the diabetes. In fact, it Derain Jews carbohydrate metabolism even further.The Newcastle protocol, by evacuating the fat inside The liver and pancreas, actually restores the pancreas’s normal insulin spiked response to glucose!!I love telling people about the benefits of a whole food plant-based diet, but so many people are unwilling to make such a big long term change.Even though the Newcastle protocol is not pleasant (Taylor talked about hunger pangs disappearing, but both cases cited mention the opposite), it is temporary. Afterwords person is free to choose whichever diet is most suited for him from for the weight loss and maintenance. And that diet can include a baked potato.Thanks again. However, I had thought that LCHF diets could reverse diabetes in (obese) people to the extent that they deliver very significant weight loss? This would only be short-term I imagine given the nature of LCHF diets.Anyway, on this broad topic of fat and insulin resistance, I thought that the 2011 article below was very interesting. You might also find it interesting. http://advances.nutrition.org/content/2/3/261.fullThe low-carb diet may work short-term, as you mentioned. I would be cautious long-term. Thanks for sharing that study. Looks like focusing on lowering fat intake (especially saturated fat) could be advantageous.You do know Joseph, there are a lot of studies out there showing the problems of reducing saturated fats along with the benefits of increasing it. I highly suggest you pick up some of Gary Taubes audio books, it goes through study by study with full pull on the effects and there are many studies over the past few decades. Many of these studies were trying to prove the benefits of a low fat (low saturated fat diet), but the all failed to prove their point while simultaneously proving saturated fat was a necessity (given the amount of deaths who abstained from it).Gary Taubes is a snake oil saleman. He is not a doctor or expert in the field of nutrition like the good Dr Greger and his colleges are. Taubes was paid $700,000 to write a pro-fat book with a predetermined outcome. He was funded by special interests to promote the beef, egg, dairy industry. You’ve been duped like so many other low-carbers.This is a low-fat vegan site. Not a Weston A price psudo-scince forum. Plenty of people who will agree with you over on the paleo sites. But this site is based on sound science and that science points to whole foods, plant based diets low in fat and animal products to promote health and healing. Saturated fat from animal sources are most certainly not your friend and not advocated on this site.The diet LCHF diet works both short and long term. From what I found out, there is a certain amount of glycogen in your liver and muscles, I believe someone mentioned the exact amount on this page. Glycogen holds water, if you deplete the glycogen from your body (which is what happens with LCHF), you’ll lose water, thus you will lose weight, not fat initially.The upside long-term effect of this is it makes your body insulin sensitive meaning it’s more welcoming to carbs to top up it’s glycogen stores without spilling over. You want to be insulin sensitive because that is when your body can burn fat. Insulin shuts off the body’s ability to burn fat. If your insulin sensitive, you don’t have any insulin in your system, hence you can burn fat. The only downside is, you lost some water in your muscles initially due to the glycogen drop.Create an insulin sensitive body and you create a fat burning body. One of the ways to do that is to deplete the body’s glycogen.Low carb does not work long term. Low-carb diets mask symptoms but cure nothing. Thy can be used for short term weight loss but at the detriment to your arteries and organs. Low-carb is a dangerous fad like Atkins and best to stay away from it.The phrase “protein-sparing” is used by Evelyn Kocur on her Carbsanity blog in relation to the Newcastle protocol. The full phrase she used is “protein sparing modified fast (PSMF)”.Thanks. OK. I am still unsure about the accuracy of the protein-sparing description because I had a look at the Optifast website and its shakes seem to be 39% protein. I couldn’t tell if Optifast products are vegan/vegetarian. That said, the Newcastle protocol is explicitly vegetarian since it specifically excludes meat, fish, poultry and dairy. I think eggs are out also (but not mentioned) because the recipes are described as “vegetable”.Since the brain is a big consumer of glucose, it would be interesting to know if fat accumulates in brain cells too – perhaps causing some related diseases. Also are the brain cells affected by the high glucose levels, do they also become insulin resistant ?Also I assume a diet also high in sucrose, with some alcohol thrown in makes the fatty liver worse, compounding the fat related issues.The brain is not a big consumer of glucose, it only needs a small amount of it and it’s capable of getting it from stored fat.You are correct, any diet high in both sugar and alcohol are destined to have a fatty liver. The same also applies for a diet rich in starchy foods, fruits, and grains.Any opinions on the fact that obese premenopausal women have a better outcome if they develop breast cancer than their normal weight counterparts ? It came to mind since the video mentions that obese wome are at a bigger risk of getting breast cancer.Hi irina, if you could share a particular source, so that we can see study design, data, conclusions, etc, you will likely get more feedback from commenters here.I did just a quick search and saw many articles on breast cancer risk for pre/postmenopausal women, but not on outcomes, so if you could share a study that looks at outcomes that would be helpful.I did find this relatively recent (2012) review (many studies in this area appear to be from the late 90s), which focuses specifically on the conflicting findings from different studies that have looked at BMI and breast cancer risk, in both pre and post-menopausal women. It goes through in detail various potential sources of error and bias (e.g. manner and timing of reporting of weight, mammography, high risk vs average population, cancer subtypes, hormone therapies, etc) that may be confounding results, and relates results of previous studies to those of a more recent study which attempted to correct for some of these errors. In this more recent study, risk of breast cancer for premenopausal women classified as higher risk, were 50% higher for overweight women and 70% higher for obese women compared to normal weight women. Surprisingly they didn’t find a significant positive association between BMI and postmenopausal breast cancer risk. It appears that this is an area where any clear and consistent association has yet to be elucidated.http://cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org/content/5/4/515.longIn my country, it´s common practice among GP`s to advice the newly diagnosed with type two diabetes to loose 10% of their body weight within a relatively short time since studies, and now practice shows, that the diabetes goes away in 90% of cases. So the good news are not new to me but still good Dr Greger.What about the mechanisms the body goes through to store carbohydrates as fat in your body? Couldn’t that fat be an issue as well?Good question Mark. I am not sure exact mechanisms, but I do not think carbohydrates are simply stored as fat. I think it depends on the amount and type of carbohydrate. Keep in mind the body and brain thrive on glucose as a primary energy source. The liver is very efficient at making glycogen and storing it. I highly recommend Dr. Greger’s book, Carbophobia. You can read it for free, here. Fat is an issue just like excess simple carbohydrates (soda, added sugar, donuts, refined grains, etc.) for diabetes. The goal is to have plenty of fiber and antioxidants in the diet. From Dr. Barnard’s research patients received either a vegan diet or a typical diet for diabetes and found significant changes in weight loss and insulin levels. Dr. Greger presents this study in this video.Like many of these studies debunked like Dr Barnard’s, did it ever address cortisol and it’s long lasting effects on the body, weight loss, and insulin. Did it address the catabolism of proteins and aminos?No it didn’t. Before bringing studies like this up, you need to bring in the full pull of the study, because if you did, you’d see the study proved against what they were trying to say.The liver is only capable of storing 70 grams of glycogen before it’s topped out. That doesn’t make it an ideal energy source. You can blow through that in about 3 100m sprints. After that your relying on the remaining glycogen in your muscles (another 3 sprints if your lucky), then it’s all fat stores provided your consuming enough fat to create the correct hormonal balance.There is the reason the body can store so much fat in abundance, that is because it’s the ideal fuel source, not carbs. If carbs were the body’s preferred fuel source, it’d store more than the 225 or so that it does for the average person.The question is then Mark, what is causing the carbs to be stored as fat. The most alarming thing about what the R.D (Joseph) said below is frightening and so factually untrue to the point they should have their licensed revoked.Your a dietitian and you don’t know the exact mechanisms? The body thrives on glucose as it’s primary energy source? Are you kidding me?Matt I can answer your question in 2 points in a nutshell.Why carbs get stored as fat? The liver holds roughly 70 grams of glycogen, and the muscles hold roughly 1-2% of their volume in glycogen. For the average male at 180lbs this equates to roughly 225 grams of Glycogen in total. Glycogen is stored carbs to be used for energy. If your liver and muscles are fully topped up with glycogen, it gets stored as fat, it’s as simple as that. So if one wants to eat lots of carbs without it being stored as fat, one needs to deplete the glycogen from their liver and muscles first. This is only done by intermittent fasting, exercise, and NOT eating carbs. This makes the person “insulin sensitive” so in other words the body needs glycogen to top up it’s stores. Keep in mind 225 is not a lot, a plate of pasta, couple pieces of toast, fruit, and some juice will put anyone over the top even when fully depleted.It’s as simple as that Matt, and that’s how body builders use it to their advantage.Now as for the glucose being the primary energy source, this is beyond untrue. If glucose was our primary energy source, our body’s would store more of it, but it doesn’t, it stores fat. Fat is it’s primary energy source, glucose is just the “easiest” source hence why our body burns through that first when the fight or flight mechanism is triggered. Glucose is ideally burned for intense exercise, fat is ideally burned for everything else.Good video up until the end — but then we run into an important and unfortunately catastrophic presumption, which is that eating fat creates fat people. Physiology is of course much more complicated than that.Eating fat stimulates satiety, the “full” sensation, because it more effectively stimulates the release of the satiety hormones leptin, Cholecystokinin, and Gastric Inhibitory Peptide, and suppresses the release of Ghrelin as well as Neuropeptide Y, both of which stimulate hunger. Thus, even though fat is a more concentrated store of energy, because it produces a stronger and longer lasting “full” feeling, people eating a higher fat diet often tend to eat an overall lower amount of calories. This reality is not just academic — it’s part of the reason why diets such as Atkins and South Beach are effective in causing weight loss without the sensation of being hungry.Of course, it gets even more complicated than that, because variations in genetics means that some metabolic types tolerate fats well and some do not, so diet tests administered without regard for genetic differences will produce conflicting results, and the complication then gets even deeper in that hunger may be a generic response to nutritional deficiencies. We see this generic “eating” response, for example, in conditions such as pica in response to low iron or zinc levels — the body has a limited number of ways to communicate to us that something is wrong.In the end, we have to respect that the body is technology, and it is technology designed for a specific situation and purpose. We are designed to eat nutritionally dense foods with a relative paucity of carbohydrates and salt and thus crave what is normally scarce, designed to have alternating periods of feasting and fasting, designed to get a lot of sun, designed to get a lot of exercise and especially exercise that consists of bursts of anaerobic activity, and designed to be exposed to at least 8 hours if not more of complete dark. Messing up any one of these will result in a cascade of imbalances. And, our modern lifestyle unfortunately messes up all of them.We now eat a preponderance of carbohydrate foods that are also nutritionally deficient because they are grown on soil whose productivity has been pushed past what it is actually capable of supporting. We do this because we have figured out that we can force plants to grow and produce by giving them nitrogen/phosphorus/potassium only, irrespective of whether micronutrients (like zinc and iron and sulfur) are present in adequate amounts. This of course produces unhealthy soil and unhealthy plants that are more prone to waves of weed and pest infestations, which we keep at bay by dumping herbicides and pesticides and fungicides on the plants and soil, which of course produces even less healthy soil and plants in an endless feedback loop. These chemicals then end up in our bodies in steadily increasing amounts, where they exacerbate the nutritional deficiencies we get from eating food grown in depleted soil (Roundup is a chelator. Monsanto itself declares 5.6 mg/kg of plant weight to be an “extreme” level of glyphosphate residue, and Norway scientists recently found 9mg/kg average in GM soy from Iowa, and German scientists found that increasing levels of glyphosphate residues in human urine correlated with increasing incidence of chronic illness.) And, because our meat is raised in an artificial environment on grains their stomachs aren’t built to eat (like GM soy), their fat profile ends up being heavily tilted towards the omega 6 (pro inflammatory) pathway and away from the omega 3 (anti inflammatory) pathway, and omega 3 stimulates peripheral endocannabinoid satiety receptors that omega 6 does not. So, overeating may be a response to nutritional deficiencies and a jacked up fat balance, which is itself the consequence of the “green revolution.”We obviously don’t exercise. We don’t sleep as much as we need to or get good sleep or get enough sun exposure, thanks to artificial light, TV, smart phones, and increasing obesity that leads to sleep apnea, along with catastrophically poor recommendations from a medical system beset by the problem of knowledge getting stuck in silos, such that dermatologists focused on skin cancer recommend less sun for everyone without regard to the damage lack of sun will cause to the rest of the body. We don’t go without food as frequently or for as long as we need to to get our gut hormones back to to a healthy set point (fasting leads to higher levels of ghrelin and neuropeptide Y, both of which are protective against depression.)Our medical system is fundamentally incapable of dealing with this multifactorial problem because our medical system approaches health backwards, just like many of our farmers approach farming backwards. Many farmers believe that they “grow” crops and ignore the reality that crops actually grow themselves. All farmers are supposed to do is make sure the crops have what they need, and from this perspective it is clear that too much intervention will lead to poorer outcomes, and also clear that interventions tend to tilt soil away from a healthy balance which results in cascading failures until the deficiency is corrected. Similarly, our current medical system is built around the idea that doctors “heal” patients, when in fact most patients heal themselves. All doctors should actually do is figure out what is missing, which almost 100% of the time is most assuredly not yet another pharmaceutical, just like the problem with unhealthy crops is most assuredly not a deficiency of yet another herbicide. Type II diabetes, for example, is most definitely not due to a deficiency of metformin, so the best that adding metformin can do is to put a bandaid over the symptoms of the real problem so that we can temporarily pretend that it doesn’t exist.But, medicine practiced from a systems perspective is tantamount to encouraging patients to embrace discomfort (recommending fasting, diet changes towards more expensive but healthier food, exercise, more sleep, no lights at night), but much of medicine is shaped around alleviating discomfort rather than educating patients about its necessity. And thus, the medical system in the end is simply reflective of a faulty paradigm for life on the part of the population, and until we all learn to change our thinking, we cannot expect the doctors to recommend things we are not willing to accept.all this information it is so important , just now happen to me to have 2 persons with fatty liver, that didn’t understand at all before i have explained to them what i sow in this video. I did because they speak only spanish. and i think it is something that happen to many other people. Dr Greeger and all the team are doing an excellent work that may change the health of millions of people. it will be nice to find a systematic way to translate the content of the videos with volunteer work double checked in some way (talking about health mistakes may be dangerous). i we do, use or had some platform for translating another millions of people may have this wonderful possibility of understand the right actions to have a healthy life. (sorry if you have done that already, in this case i will be happy to share the content )Some video’s do have subtitles. Click the “cc” button at the bottom of video to see if it does. So glad you are benefiting from the website! If interested in volunteering or you have skills translating videos please let us know! http://nutritionfacts.org/volunteer/Thanks, noemarcial, Josephi will need to be a little supervised but yes i have translate some videos to spanish and i will be very happy to help in my free time (it is not much, if is useful for you i will be happy to do it)Fatty liver is soley caused by body’s ability to break down sugar because it’s flooded with it. Too much starchy foods, fruit, grain products, and dairy can cause it.One of the best defenses and cures for fatty liver (aside from eliminating sugar) is Choline, and that is found in abundance in egg yolks. Naturpoaths go as far as to actually inject choline into people’s systems to flush out the liver and it works wonders.The population that is at highest risk for fatty liver (aside from alcoholics) are those who abstain from eggs and partake in a diet that’s heavy in starchy foods, fruits, and grains.Some saturated fat is Protective against diabetes, according to a recent study. Please see: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/280645.phpSome saturated fat is Protective against Diabetes, according to a recent study: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/280645.phpI would be cautious of articles like the one you linked to as it seems to promote dairy products. Dairy is a major source of Trans-fats and is associated with acne, ashma, calcium LOSS and a host of other ill effects. See what Dr Greger has to say about dairy here~> http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-hormonal-interference/Dairy is not associated with any of those things, it all depends on the individual, and 99% of the people who consume dairy don’t get those symptoms. They do however tend to gain weight.Bob, I’m not sure why you are here on a low-fat vegan site throwing rocks when you have plenty of cigarette-science low-carb sites to frequent with people who would agree you, but I am not one of them… Dairy IS associated with the things I mentioned above and your blanket dismisal without watching the videos I provided was not appreciated. Dairy is a very degenerative and harmful food. It’s meant for baby cows, not humans.saturated fat is protective against diabetes but dairy is a strict no no. Lactose has the same insulin response as drinking a can of pop or a bowl of pasta.Saturated fats from animals definitely helps protect against diabetes.This is rubbish. Where is the evidence for such claims/There have been several scientific researches that have picked apart the studies over the past 60 years on this and various other issues regarding the food pyramid. All the research done generally was trying to prove that low fat with moderate to high carb was ideal for health. This included saturated fats in regards to diabetes.The problem with the research is all of it failed to prove low fat w/ moderate to high carb was ideal. In fact, it proved the exact opposite. It proved saturated fat was essential for countless things: Protection against disease, diabetes, weight loss, cardiovascular health and hormonal balance to name a few. The most interesting part of all those studies is that none of them were ever published and their reasoning was that they were disappointed in the results.One of them was Gary Taubes (scientific researcher), listen or read his books, it goes very in depth with all those studies over the long haul. If you are interested in nutrition in regards to health, it’s quite fascinating to read how all those studies turned out (and were kept quiet).Gary Taubes is not a researcher. He is a journalist – you know, one of those people who never let the facts get in the way of a good story. I have read one of his books – if I remember correctly, it was remarkable for the science it omitted to mention as well as including some downright falsehoods (eg about Ancel Keys). if you want to know about low carb high fat diets check the professional literature. And as far as I know, the body makes all the saturated fat it needs. it’s amazing how people can believe that a journalist selling a mass market sensational book on diet, knows more about nutrition and health than the expert panels convened by the World Health Organization, the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations,the World Cancer Research Fund and countless dietary guidelines advisory committees around the world. If people want to know about saturated fat they can read the latest study at the US National Evidence Library.Hi Tom! Cesar is correct. There has been tons of research on this over the past few decades. Most all of the research was attempting to prove one thing while it ended up proving the exact opposite. None of the studies ever really got published, nor held up to any criticism when other scientists started asking questions.Gary Taubes is an interesting author and a great scientific researcher. The amount of studies he covers is immense and you might be pleasantly surprised at all the findings when all these studies are fully exposed.Gary Taubes is a sudo-science book profiteer. He is by no means an expert in anything health related. He was a paid shill for the beef, egg and dairy industry. If you look at the studies he sites, they are all smoke and mirrors. Heve a look…http://plantpositive.com/11-the-journalist-gary-taubes/I agree. But I have a type 1 diabetes friend who swears by low carb high fat diet to control her blood sugar. She says it works great and her weight and cholesterol and LDL are low. How can this be healthy? Maybe Type 1’s are different?The difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are:Type 1 – Insulin dependent meaning they need to inject insulin so they can in fact store their nutrients, otherwise they starve (this is why they are generally thin)Type 2 – Insulin resistance meaning their bodies have been flooded with insulin over time rending their insulin receptor cells resistant. This is reversed by minimizing the insulin response foods over the long term along with intermittent fasting and exercise. Insulin stops the glucagon hormone from releasing stored energy (glycogen and fat), this is why type 2 diabetics are generally hefty.The reason your friend is doing well on a low carb high fat diet is because it’s never a good idea to flood insulin in your system regardless of whether you have to inject it or not. I’m also willing to bet your friend is more satisfied with her meals and not starving like those who try to eliminate fats.are diabetics ok to eat 1 Tablespoon of ground flaxseed daily?Depends on overall diet, but to me 1 TBSP of flax is fairly innocent and a small dose, therefore I would see no concerns.You have to consider if your thyroid is healthy or not. If it isn’t, flaxseed oil will do more harm than good to your body overall. Usually people who over-consume grains have thyroid issues.If you have thyroid issues, one shouldn’t be consuming any flaxseed at all. Thyroid problems also go hand in hand with insulin resistance, so if a person is borderline diabetic or diabetic, they shouldn’t be consuming flax seed.When the thyroid is struggling to produce energy, Flaxseed is not it’s friend.If Type 2 diabetes is characterized by the insulin-producing cells being killed off, then how come the condition is said to be reversible with diet? Do the insulin-producing cells regenerate?Good question. Not sure it is that simple. Type 2 diabetics still have insulin-producing cells, however, the cells may be compromised and not working properly (perhaps they operate at 80% or less?). Insulin may not be working correctly, but the body still producing it. Once all insulin producing cells are dead, (now we’re talking type 1 diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes) then of course the body will require insulin. I have never heard of pancreatic beta cells regenerating. The thought is that a healthful diet (supported by weight loss in obese diabetics) may be able to control blood sugar and insulin levels and keep the remaining insulin-producing cells in the pancreas alive.Type 1 or Insulin Dependent Diabetes is an autoimmune disorder where the body attacks the insulin producing cells in our pancreas (i.e. beta cells). Some authors have posited that the breakdown of dairy products result in compounds similar to the proteins on the surface of the beta cell. These compounds can get into the body similar to other substances aided by the saturated fats see.. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-exogenous-endotoxin-theory/. The focus on diabetes has shifted to type 2 diabetes see… http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-prediabetes-in-children/ Autoimmune to intake of dairy products. For me as a Family Medicine physician my recommendations given current science as they relate to type 2 diabetes… low fat… whole plant based diet emphasizing starches for adequate calorie intake excluding all oils and limiting avocados and nuts see… http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-diabetes/. I make the same recommendation relating to the avoidance of Type 1 Diabetes especially avoiding the tendency of my colleagues to use age 2 to start recommending the intake of dairy products. I believe the bulk of science shows that whole food plant based diet with adequate Vitamin B12 intake represents the best nutritional approach to minimizing your chance of getting both type 1 and 2 diabetes. I haven’t seen any good studies on the actual mechanism of how the beta cells “wear out” after years of over production of insulin… but stay tuned to NutritionFacts.org as the science keeps coming!We actually had a doctor in town here get sued for recommending a plant based, starch style diet that was low fat to diabetics. If you want good studies to prove how damaging the over production of insulin is, comb through all the studies Gary Taubes mentions in his book for the full pull on the results and you’ll see just how bad it is.Dr. Greger addresses this extensively at http://www.atkinsexposed.orgAtkins is a poor example to use as Atkins diet has changed a lot since it first came out. At one time it was eat as much protein and fat as you want and it doesn’t matter where it came from. Now it’s more in line with paleo, eat your protein and fat till satiety, and make sure it comes from good healthy sources, not processed foods.Doctors have to be careful when addressing Atkins because if they fall in the trap without actually knowing where it came from compared to what it is now, they basically show their ignorance on the subject.Atkins was a perfect example of how dangerous a low-carb diet is. He was a resort entertainer and salesman when he came up with his crazy diet that actually killed people himself included. Dr Greger has done great work exposing Atkins here ~> atkinsexposed.org as well as exposing the lies put forth by the paleo low-carb crowd.Here is a video talking about fat and its roll in insulin resistance (not carbs or sugar)http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-causes-insulin-resistance/Here’s some of that crazy non-Taubesian kind of talk from a few months ago: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4329824/ .Some evidence that it is not the fat at all, it may be the meat proteins and heme iron (thanks to Dr. Garth Davis for the tip). But you can’t separate the two. Satfat started out as code for meat, we shouldn’t carry on the discussion in the way it has been framed by the food deconstructors http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25832335It’s not meat proteins and it’s not fat. Ask yourself this, what foods cause the biggest insulin response, aka, what foods cause the biggest flood of glucose in the system causing your insulin to go sky high to clear it? What foods make people crash?It isn’t meats & fats. People even crash hard after eating fruit.. that is the first clue..Nope definitely something in the neat. Watch the vid glucose spike is a symptom not a cause.If this were the case, then all body builders would have Type 2 Diabetes would they not? I mean the amount of protein they consume in the form of chicken, beef, and fish would surely make them diabetic would it not? They also consume considerable amounts of fat.Better question, how about you go find a diabetic body builder and we’ll start from there. Problem is, you won’t find one because meat proteins don’t cause it, nor does fat.Hi! PCRM is recommending and ultra low fat diet to treat type 2 diabetes. This includes animal fats, added refined oils and natural vegetable fats such as those in nuts, avocados and olives. I am wondering if there is any data showing that whole food plant based fats are bad for type 2 diabetics?Hi David. This video discussed dietary interventions conducted by PCRM: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-workplace-intervention/I have not seen any negative research on whole food plant-based diets and diabetes.Thank you Dr. GonzalesNo problem. FYI I am a dietitian ;) and lastly this video I forgot to mention this video reveals the actual PCRM study if you’d rather hear it from Dr. Greger.I did find a Harvard paper that talks about type of fat and its relation to risk of type 2 diabetes. Here’s the link. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2654180/pdf/nihms91661.pdfSo there appears to be some controversy around this issue since PCRM advocates avoiding all types of fat. This paper seems to suggest it’s the type of fat that’s important.Interesting. Yes it may depend on type of fat. Please note PCRM does not advocate avoiding all types of fat, but simply keeping fats low. I forgot to show the actual study that PCRM conducted comparing a vegan diet vs a diabetes friendly diet. Both diets worked, but it appeared the vegan diet faired better. At any rate, diabetes need to find a diet that helps them control their blood sugar and insulin levels, lose weight (if overweight), and hopefully decrease medications (if prescribed). A vegan diet is one way to achieve this, according to this study.For those that have type 2 diabetes, is their pancreas no longer functioning properly only due to the fat in the pancreas? i.e. if you start on a low fat diet and start exercising, will the fat eventually leave the pancreas and the beta cells in the pancreas will regenerate or heal? Or are those damaged cells lost, and even if the fat eventually leaves the pancreas the function of the pancreas will be lower than it originally was?Hey MikeOnRaw. Dr. Forrester and I posted some information below (a few comments down) see if they help?found them, and yes they did. So basically, it would be best not to get in a position that you need to worry about your beta cell health. This seems terribly important information. So much of what we hear in the media is focused on treating diabetes, we need a lot more focus on how important it is to prevent through diet, not drugs.Their pancreas are continually pumping out insulin because the insulin receptors on the cells are resistant due to having too much insulin in the system. It’s a vicious circle.Think of it this way, insulin is this really annoying dude that keeps knocking at the door. An insulin receptor is another dude who lets the guy in. At some point in time, the guy inside gets sick of hearing the knocking on the door so he just ignores it. The knocking gets louder and louder, but the guy continually ignores it. The pancreas don’t give up and continually produce more insulin so the knocking becomes so unbearable that guy finally lets insulin in. It’s almost like the boy who cried wolf.The ideal situation is the knocking on the door is suttle and the guy lets him in. The problem is though, when you eat foods that cause mass pounding on the door, your insulin receptors get a tad annoyed.. even more so if it continually happens over time.So what causes the knocking to get really loud? What releases tons of insulin? Simple sugars: table sugar, fruit juice, candy bars, and soda being the biggest culprit. Not far behind is white breads, rice, and most grains. All cause big surges in insulin and will thus become quite annoying to your insulin receptors. We know this to be true because how often do people crash from the flood of glucose in their system from the above foods? How often do people crash from eating a piece of chicken or a salad with olive oil? Fat isn’t the culprit, simple carbs are.The only way to make your insulin receptors more welcoming to insulin when it comes knocking at the door is to make insulin more welcome. There is a whole other tangent involved with this, but the short answer is intermittent fasting, exercise, and eating foods that minimize insulin response. Aka stay away from simple sugars and most grains.Did you watch the video? The process is clearly one related to excess fat, not sugar. Though industrial sugar may be a contributing factor, the cause is excess fat. I regularly eat 170-250g of sugar from raw fruit and vegetables per meal. My glucose doesn’t spike, nor does it crash.That’s because your constantly flooding your body with sugar, it doesn’t have time to crash. Eating that much sugar per meal, you have bigger things to worry about like a fatty liver.The only real “visual” symptom is it’s normally associated with Type 2 Diabetes. This is due to the main cause of Type 2 being the insulin constantly elevated due to the amount of glucose being flooded into your blood stream from sugary foods. Unfortunately the only way you’ll find that out is getting a liver test + ultrasound , but god help you if you do, that is a long uphill battle to flush it out. It can be done and naturopaths are a big help by injecting choline into your system to speed up the process.The unfortunate reality though is, if you do have it, you’ll be looking at minimum of 1.5 years on basically a no sugar diet, which includes no fruit, and no starch. Basically it’s all green veggies, protein and fat.No, that is not true… Where are you getting this information from? A low-carb blog site? Jimmy Moore or West A. Price foundation? Those are not real science based organizations. Chronic elevated blood sugar is only a SYMPTOM of insulin resistance. Saturated fat is the CAUSE of insulin resistance like this video above shows. Can you provide any non psudo-science sources to back up your claim that something gets ‘burned out’ from to much sugar or carbs? Because that’s not what real world science shows.Type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance. Your insulin receptors attached to your cells no longer want to accept it so they become resistant to it. This happens when the insulin levels are chronically elevated. That happens because too much glucose floods into your blood stream causing the insulin to get secreted to clear it. This is cause by foods that convert to glucose rather quickly like sugars and starches.In regards to your question about fat in the pancreas (or liver), the only way that gets reduced is when you stop consuming the foods that put it there, sugar and starches.No that is wrong and dangerous misinformation….. Did you watch the video? It shows very clearly that saturated fat works against insulin’s ability to let glucose into the cells having nothing to do with sugar or carbs. This notion put forth by the low-carb gurus that something gets ‘burned out’ buy to much carbs/sugar is completely false. Nothing gets ‘burned out’ buy to much sugar. There is no science to back up that myth. Have a look at this video debunking the Paleo-low carb smoke and mirrors.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/low-carb-diets-and-coronary-blood-flow/Honest question, what confused me the most is how people with pre type 2 diabetes and type 2 diabetes who on a low carb and high fat diet get improve. That some type 2 diabetes can come off medication and apparently to even reverse the disease in some cases. If you go on diabetes forums they is a fair few type 2 diabetes that look to be doing well on a high fat diet.What I don’t understand is how to square this circle, if fat cause diabetes then how can eating more of it help halt or reverse it?Are they lying? faking the results? some other reason?I am on a low carb diet and check my fasting insulin and its always in the 4-5 mmol range. should I be worried I will get diabetes? I feel ok, I have lost weight and feel the need to be more active.Are you asking this question honestly? One just has to understand how both insulin works and it’s relation to diabetes (Type 2). We know that Type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance so the next question is what exactly is insulin resistance.Insulin resistance – Where your insulin receptor cells fail to let insulin do it’s job when insulin comes knocking at the door. Essentially the cells just won’t answer it though. The pancreas could care less and just continually produce insulin until the receptors open the door to let all the nutrients in. The downside, the more this goes on, the more resistant the cells become, hence “insulin resistant”Now the question is, why is this bad, I mean the body is doing it’s job right? Yes it is, but there is 2 problems with this; for one, insulin shuts off the glucagon hormone and it’s ability to release stored energy (fat and carbs). Putting 2 and 2 together, this obviously is going to cause weight gain as the body loses it’s ability to burn fat. The other problem is having too much insulin in your system wears down the receptors in general and degrading them further. The ultimate goal for someone is to be insulin sensitive, not insulin resistant.So the next question is, what causes insulin to flood into the body? This is where the disconnect with this video (and doctor) seem to come in. We already know what causes insulin and the blood sugar to spike, simple carbs; things like table sugar, fruit juice, pop, candy bars, white pastas, and most grains etc.. Next on this list is complex carbs like fruit and oatmeal and some whole wheat pastas. Next up is proteins (beef, fish, and poultry), and that is where it pretty much ends. All those foods cause an insulin response whereas protein is lowest on that list. Protein also slows down the insulin response, so this is why all successful weight loss plans and type 2 diabetic diets consist of eating carbs (preferably veggies) WITH protein to slow down the insulin response.Notice how I didn’t mention fats on here, that’s because fats have little to no effect on insulin. If you want to take 10 spoonfuls of olive or coconut oil, guess what, your insulin won’t even bat an eyelash. This is why diabetics not only get improvements in health, but often reverse the disease entirely. They stick to a higher fat (good fat) diet with proteins and minimal foods that cause an insulin response. If your looking at a dinner plate, it’s filled half with green veggies (very little response), quarter with protein (to blunt the response), and some sort of fat to blunt insulin even further and increase satiety.This in a nutshell is called paleo, non processed foods where calories primarily come from good fats (olive oil, coconut oil, nuts, seeds, egg yolks, and saturated fat from animals. The macro nutrient ratio is essentially around 60% fats, 20-30% proteins, and 10-20% carbs (from veggies primarily). This is what diabetics generally eat and are prescribed to treat the disease.Now the last question, is this video lying? Yes, but more so why.. The doctor brings up studies that are void of truth. The studies have already been exposed to neglect important pieces of the puzzle as to cherry pick their own data. Over the past 60 years, scientists have been trying to prove many things that are in essence bad for our health (though saying good for us). Many of funders were driven either by corporations or the government been funded by the corporations. The end result, all the studies out there never proved their point. In fact, the vast majority of them completely went against their intention, while the rest showed no effect. The studies were never published, but when asked why, they replied with “it wasn’t what we had hoped for”.Now as to why the doctor is using these studies but not disclosing the “whole” study, that is a mystery. I compare it to someone trying to prove meat causes brain damage. A study is done on 20 people. Ten had brain damage eating meat while the other 10 didn’t being vegan. The study chalks it up as meat is the culprit but neglects to inform everyone those 10 were also boxers who got clocked in the head one too many times. It’s all relative and this is why most scientific studies are cherry picked data.The reason people get results with low-carb high fat diet is because of the minimal effects on insulin fat provides. There is no 2 ways around it. The camp that is lying is the camp that promotes starchy and moderate to high carb as either a cure or a mean to prevent diabetes. It’s all completely just wrong.Put it this way, you ever heard of the term “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it”? Well there is a reason the primary and go-to cure from nearly every doctor (including the mainstream western doctors) is low-carb & high fat.The other issue is, there was a person here who wrote up a decent little spiel on how insulin and diabetes go hand in hand. It got tons of likes, and consequently the mods of this forum pulled it, because I guess it “didn’t agree” with their views. Therein lies the problem, they don’t want people to know the truth for some odd reason.I’ll break it down in a nutshell:Type 1 Diabetes: Insulin dependent. People are usually born with this or acquire it at a very young age. These people are usually paper thin. They need to take insulin so they can in fact store their nutrients, otherwise they starve and die.Type 2 Diabetes: Insulin Resistant – People acquire this through bad diet and partly (possibly) pre-disposed to it at birth making them a little more likely to get it if they aren’t careful. Insulin resistant is at it sounds, the body (or cells in this case) are resistant to the insulin the body produces.So the question is, why? Well when you think of insulin as some annoying dude who continually knocks at the door, and your insulin receptors attached to cells are the guy inside who opens the door.. well eventually that guy inside gets sick of hearing the door knock so he ignores it. The more he ignores it, the louder the knocking gets. By this I mean the more insulin the pancreas produce to force the cells to store the nutrients. Do you see where I’m going with this? More and more insulin flooded into the body? Eventually the cells become resistant to it.Well you look at the foods that causes the biggest insulin secretion, and luckily we have that beautiful little glycemic index plastered all over online. You’ll notice that list is heavily titled to towards sugars and foods that get converted into glucose rather quickly. This we know as our friend the carbohydrate, they dominate the top of that list from straight table sugar, fruit juices, candy bars, starchy carbs, all the way down to vegetables. Then on the low end you have proteins like meats, fish, and poultry. Then on the complete low end, you have fats because they produce little to no insulin which has been proven, hence why doctors prescribe it.So if you want to “fix” Type 2 diabetes, you keep your insulin levels low so your body becomes more insulin sensitive. Basically think of it as your giving your insulin receptors a break, let them heal a bit, breathe, and get a new lease on life before they deal with that annoying guy (insulin) knocking at the door again. There are a few ways to accelerate the process: Intermittent fasting, exercise, and certain foods like cinnamon help with insulin resistance.The biggest question of all is, why the moderators on this forum refuse to believe it, yet their being concrete proof and thousands upon thousands of success stories and testimonials on it. Then to further the problem, the research this site uses to try and prove their claims, was debunked by scientific researcher a few years ago.I’m sorry Bobby but you are dead wrong and trolling this site way to much with your low carb pseudo-science. There is a great web series at Plantpositive.com that addresses the cigarette-science tactics employed by the low-carb movement. Low carb gurus like the ones you speak of use confusion tactics to trick people into thinking that a high fat & meat diet is somehow healthy. It is not and no amount of low-carb smoke and mirrors with change that. Here is an interesting video on Mr. Taubes.http://plantpositive.com/1-the-journalist-gary-taubes-1/As Bobby below said, it’s the high fat low carb is what fixes it, not vice versa. Keep sticking to what your doing (low carb) because it’s working.Fat has little to no effect on insulin so you don’t need to worry about it causing insulin resistance.That is not true. Saturated fat IS the culpret and cause of type II diabetes as Dr Greger shows in this video. High fat diets are a dangerous fad. You are regurgitating old low-carb lies that are being spread around by book selling profiteers like Gary Taubes, Westman, Jimmy Moore and the rest of the pseudo-science book hucksters. You can eat all the bacon wrapped butter you like but please don’t come here to this site and try to misguide these good folks that somehow fat and meat are healthy. They are not and this site shows that.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/Hi Andrew, My advice would be not to listen to the low-carb trolls like Romona and Linda. They are fake accounts most likely by this Bobby character who’s been running around here stinking up the place lately. The science based evidence that Dr Greger and his colleges present here is correct. This video above explains why Lipotoxixty (saturated fat) is the root of many of our most common diseases. Here is another one of Dr Greger videos on the subject.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-the-paleo-diet-argument/The reason some low-carbers see improvements in health is because the diet restricts calories and in turn you lose weight and weight-loss by any means will improve health makers… doesn’t make it healthy, just caloric restriction in disguised… but at what cost and damage to your organs and arteries? A much safer and healthier way to lose weight would be the diet advocated by this site. A low fat, low protein, plant based diet devoid of animal foods, oils and processed junk…It may be attributed to the weight loss or short-duration of study. There are concerns about following a low-carb diet long-term (and even short-term), but please do what you feel is best. I think it is a silly argument to say sugar causes diabetes or fat causes diabetes. It is all relative to amounts and types of food and severity of the disease. From Dr. Barnard’s research, study participants received either a low-fat vegan diet or a typical diet for diabetes and found significant changes in weight loss and insulin levels. Dr. Greger presents the study in this video. So this is an opposite approach from the low-carb diet. I would worry about not obtaining enough fiber and antioxidants from a low-carb diet and yes this kind of diet may accelerate diabetes risk. If interested in a low-carb plant-based diet check out this video. I do not necessarily recommend it because I have seen excellent clinical results from a strict plant based diet A multicenter randomized controlled trial of a plant-based nutrition program to reduce body weight and cardiovascular risk in the corporate setting: the GEICO study.Best, JosephThere is so much factually wrong with this video it’s staggering and borderline ignorant. It’s almost to the point you forget what they’re even trying to prove.Type 1 Diabetes – Insulin Dependent, needs insulin to store their nutrients so they take insulin. Usually these people are on the thin sideType 2 Diabetes – Insulin Resistant, body constantly flooded with insulin to the point the insulin receptors fail to use the circulating insulin. Usually these people are on the heftier side.What are the primary functions of insulin? To store nutrients and to clear glucose out of the body.What causes insulin to get released? Sugar, carbs being converted to glucose and Amino Acids from protein, and to a lesser extent fat.What determines the amount of insulin to get released? The amount of glucose “said” food produces. Obviously simple sugars like sugar itself, pop, fruit juices, candy bars, doughnuts, and non whole-wheat pastas create the largest response. We know this because generally consuming them on their own usually produces a “crash” effect in people. Aka, a lot of glucose was released in the blood so a lot of insulin needs to be released to clear it. Usually insulin gathers a head of steam and clears too much leading your blood glucose to dip too low. The problem is because insulin shuts down your body’s ability to burn fat, your body can’t release fat to convert to glucose to level out your blood sugar.So what causes Type 2 Diabetes? Having too much insulin in your system to the point your insulin receptors are sick of hearing insulin knocking at the door. The pancreas continue to produce insulin until the receptors let them in. This floods your body with insulin and keeps it chronically elevated, AKA “insulin resistance”.So how do you treat Type 2 Diabetes or reverse it? Not consuming foods that produce a large insulin response is where you start. Intermittent fasting and exercise also go leaps and bounds with this too.So, we need to avoid foods that produce a big insulin response.. or is it a case of eating foods that blunt the insulin response. The answer is both. Proteins blunt the insulin response, while fats drastically blunt the insulin response. We know this because neither of those have any sugar in it, so their insulin response is dreadful to the point it slows down the response that carbs would generally create. We know foods like steaks have less sugar in it than apples; chicken breasts have less than carrots, and fish have less than potatoes. Who are we kidding, they have absolutely no sugar unless we put it on them in the form of sauces. This isn’t even debatable. The only reason these cause an insulin response is because of the amino acids.This is exactly why diabetics whom are successful in treating their disease have been prescribed to eat all their veggies with protein foods like beef, chicken, or fish. This is also why they are prescribed a high fat diet to create satiety because the calories have to come from somewhere if carb foods are eliminated (aside from veggies). If low-fat is prescribed, the fat burning enzymes aren’t activated, the body thinks it’s starving and will refuse to burn fat.So what should this mean to you? If you want to avoid Type 2 diabetes like the plague, don’t eat foods that cause a big insulin response, or minimize those foods. Eat all your veggies with proteins, and get your calories primarily from fat as to create the right hormonal balance and to prevent your body from thinking it’s starving. There is no secret to this, this is exactly what diabetics are prescribed today.The same goes if you want to lose weight, don’t keep your insulin levels chronically elevated because insulin turns off the body’s ability to release stored energy (carbs and fat). I say this like a broken record, but eat foods that don’t cause a big insulin response and eat them with proteins, this can’t be stressed enough. Fill the rest of your calories up with fat so you aren’t starving, and most importantly, don’t starve yourself, which brings me to my next point, cortisol.Cortisol is released in your body’s response to stress. Instead of me trying to explain it, i’m just going to copy/paste this from another article that sums it up nicely:“Blood Sugar Imbalance and Diabetes”“Under stressful conditions, cortisol provides the body with glucose by tapping into protein stores via gluconeogenesis in the liver. This energy can help an individual fight or flee a stressor. However, elevated cortisol over the long term consistently produces glucose, leading to increased blood sugar levels.Theoretically, this mechanism can increase the risk for type 2 diabetes, although a causative factor is unknown.1 Since a principal function of cortisol is to thwart the effect of insulin—essentially rendering the cells insulin resistant—the body remains in a general insulin-resistant state when cortisol levels are chronically elevated. Over time, the pancreas struggles to keep up with the high demand for insulin, glucose levels in the blood remain high, the cells cannot get the sugar they need, and the cycle continues.”In a nutshell avoid chronic stressors as much as possible. Starving yourself when hungry is a stressor. Starving your body of fat is a stressor. Too much exercise is a stressor. Even worrying about your diet is a stressor & not enough sleep is a stressor. To sum it up, don’t starve yourself; eat to satiety which includes fat.If you are someone that may have insulin resistance due to lack of sleep, cinnamon is supposed to help reverse this, and it’s tasty too.This was summed up very well. It may be hard for some people to understand the link between insulin, weight gain, and diabetes, but when you understand what food effects insulin the way it does and why, it’s easy to see the real culprit.The most basic way to look at it is foods that get broken down into glucose the quickest with sugar being the top dog (no pun intended here). Using that as your basis, you start to scale down with how much sugar exactly is in each type of food and you start to see the correlation with the glycemic index. The more carbs/sugar in food, the greater the insulin response. This is why you see proteins on the low end of the spectrum with fats not even on the spectrum.So if were going to use common sense in regards to what causes diabetes (specifically type 2 because type 1 is usually inherited), you’ll see foods with the greatest impact on insulin is what causes it. This is foods with the most carbs/sugar, not proteins, and certainly not fats. Fats have nothing in them to get broken down into glucose rapidly. It’s a slow and arduous process, that’s why people often say to burn fat you need long bouts of steady cardio, because it takes a while to metabolize.There is so much factually wrong with this video it’s staggering and borderline ignorant.

I will admit, understanding insulin took me a while but it really helps to understand what it’s functions are because then one can use common sense to see what foods exactly trigger it and how it plays with insulin resistant diabetes.My experience with this came from my sister who had insulin resistant diabetes that was linked to a diet high fruit, potatoes, and pasta. She literally would be eating 2 out of the 3 at each meal. Lucky for her, she not only took control of it but completely reversed the disease. Her breakfast turned into 2-4 eggs with usually broccoli. Lunch was chicken breast or fish with a TBSP or 2 of olive or coconut oil, along with giant spinach/kale salad. Dinner was usually either chicken, fish, or steak with some other steamed green veggies. She’d snack on nuts & seeds throughout the day, mainly almonds and pumpkin seeds. The main premise of this diet was to consume her veggies with a protein source, which as you can see was either eggs, meats, poultry, or fish.The end result was she reversed her insulin resistant diabetes in about 4-5 months. She was also intermittent fasting 2 days a week too. This is what really got me interested in nutrition. I can attest on her behalf it was a high fat low carb diet that fixed it. We estimate that roughly about 60% of her calories was from fat, 30% from protein, and 10% from carbs (all vegetables).Trolling the Vegans again? So are you Romona or Linda? I can’t tell because you seem to be posting the same low-carb troll information under several different account names. Again, this is not the place to promote fats, oils, dairy, eggs or animal protein. This is a low-fat vegan site and your attacks on the videos and science Dr greger presents is not appreciated.They are right on the money Eric. You can’t argue with what doctors prescribe as diabetic diets. It is what it is. They work and it isn’t carb and sugar ladened foods. It’s low carb and high fat.In regards to Gary Taubes, he isn’t a low carb guru, he is a scientific researcher. Their purpose is to take all the studies from both sides and lay out the raw data and present it. That way there is no cherry picking going on from either side like the doctor does here with his data. His data was already debunked. High carb was debunked, so was the causes of insulin resistance, and cardiovascular health. The data you should be looking at is the raw data from studies, and nothing more. It can only be interpreted one wayNow your just strait up trolling again… They(you) are most certainly not ‘right on the money’ LindaBobbyRamona… Low-carbers are attempting to capitalize on the public’s ignorance about nutrition to sell fad diet books and supplements. Taubes being the poster boy for this type of ‘cholesterol-confusionism’.see here ~~> http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lipotoxicity-how-saturated-fat-raises-blood-sugar/The Journalist Gary Taubes. ———————————– Dr Greger addresses Gary Taubes directly on his site Atkinsexposed.org.Here is the Taubes section… -=QUOTE=- The Washington Post investigated his pro-Atkins article and found that Taubes simply ignored all the research that didn’t agree with his conclusions.Taubes evidently interviewed a number of prominent obesity researchers and then twisted their words. “What frightens me,” said one, “is that he picks and chooses his facts…. If the facts don’t fit in with his yarn, he ignores them.”[47]The article seemed to claim that experts recommended the diet. “I was greatly offended at how Gary Taubes tricked us all into coming across as supporters of the Atkins Diet,” said John Farquhar, a Professor Emeritus of Medicine at Stanford. When the Director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the Washington University School of Medicine was asked to comment of one of Taubes’ claims, he replied, “It’s preposterous.”[48]“He took this weird little idea and blew it up,” said Farquhar, “What a disaster.”[49]“The article was written in bad faith,” said another quoted expert. “It was irresponsible.”[50] “I think he’s a dangerous man. I’m sorry I ever talked to him.” Referring to the book deal, “Taubes sold out.”[51]What the researchers stressed was how dangerous saturated fat and meat consumption could be, but Taubes seemed to have conveniently left it all out. “The article was incredibly misleading,” said the pioneering Stanford University endocrinologist Gerald Reaven who actually coined the term Syndrome X. “I tried to be helpful and a good citizen,” Reaven said, agreeing to do the interview, “and I ended up being embarrassed as hell. He sort of set me up… I was horrified.”[52] -= END QUOTE =-LOW-CAB TROLL ALERT! ———————————Linda, you are being an obnoxious low-carb troll… and calling Dr Greger and his work ‘ignorant’ is offensive. If you haven’t noticed this is not the forum for low-carbers. This is a low-fat Vegan website. You are not going to change the mind of any of us low-fat vegans by stomping around these video forums claiming you know more that the combined medical expertise of Dr. Greger and his colleges. Dr Greger explains very eloquently how Type II diabetes is causes by lipotoxicity. Please take the low-carb dogma trolling someplace else… I’m sure there are tons of Gary Taubes low-carb sites you’ll feel right at home at.

I hope that serves as some kind of inspiration to you.Grow up! Drink your milk! ….. Oehh, that’s terrible of me :)(Yes I’m aware of the early adolescence thing ^^ )These are the studies that make me puzzled as to why Dean Ornish says what he says about milk. Hopefully I can upload a picture of what I saw at the store a couple months back.Here’s the image of Dean pushing the milk on society.Ouch!!!We have all done things we aren’t proud of, clearly even the best of us. :)This was only four months ago at our local “Safe”way.I cannot believe that Dr. Dean Ornish is pushing the benefit of milk consumption. I think that most of his guidelines are correct, but this is one that I do not agree with.$$$ Search on Google, MILK LOBBY and you will be amazedI always knew he allowed a limited number of servings (0-2) of non fat dairy in his plan, also egg whites and fish oil (well at least I knew since I purchased a cookbook of his which I mistakenly assumed was WFPB). I get that his focus is primarily on reducing fat for heart disease, he’s not vegan, and perhaps does not have quite the same package-deal/non-reductionist viewpoint on food we see from Greger and Campbell. And while I think that obviously an entirely WFPB diet is ideal and follow it myself, I’m not entirely convinced that WFPB plus a tiny amount of animal products will make a meaningful difference in outcomes and have certainly always held him in great esteem for his tremendous advocacy and influence over the years. All that said, to see him actively promoting non-fat milk as healthy rather than just discouraging full-fat milk is kind of disorienting.Enough with the acronyms! What does WFPB mean???Whole Food Plant Based :-)There is this amazing site called Google…Sorry Susan, I didn’t even realize I used that one three times! Whole food plant based Whole food plant based Whole food plant based… that one’s a biggie to keep typing out. But it’s probably the most common acronym we see here. SOS (sugar oil salt) and CVD (cardiovascular disease) come up fairly often as well. It’s true we get so used to using these things we don’t think about people who might be new to it. Thanks for asking!Hi Boomer, I read a recent Q and A that he was a participant in. He actually was/is a vegan (?) but doesn’t call himself that because he likes to have the rare sushi meal down the street from where he works. I don’t have the interview handy or I would post.Correct. Dean Ornish lives in at the real active world.Eating vegan 90 -95 percent of the time, and having an occasional sushi meal is o.k. in my book. With this kind of flexibility it is very easy to exist on a plant based diet.That’s interesting Veganrunner. That was an uninformed assumption on my part! I never pictured him eating dairy or egg whites personally, but with his recommendations for fish oil I guess I assumed he was consuming that himself.The sushi thing surprises me. Vegan sushi is so fishy tasting already with just the nori. I get a vegan sushi occasionally that has avocado, pickled ginger, carrots, mango, cucumber – can’t imagine wanting the texture of raw fish over fresh veggies. Not to even mention the biomagnification or food poisoning issues. But I guess I really don’t crave any non-vegan foods. Junk foods yes, but always vegan ones ;)The other thing that might influence his choices is that in his original published research the subjects were allowed a cup (off the top of my head-it may be 1/2 cup) of yogurt per day. Soooo, although we know better that may have something to do with it.I do likewise and I agree with your statement.he’s clearly tied to the dairy industry, as here in france we have same “nutritionist” (Jean Michel Cohen) tied to Danone and other huge dairy brands and constantly trusting the big media streams (TV channels, radios) to push people consuming dairy….it is all about business. Our society produces tremendous quantities of meat, and therefore milk (one does not go without the other), and all this production must find its way to the consumer : milk, butter, cheese, (ice)cream etc…I agree with you as well. Dean Ornish is on the dole from the dairy industry to some degree like Jean Michel Cohen.Bonjour, Couba!Could you tell us a bit more about the WFPB vs Normal French diets (differing much by region?) and about the politics? Who are the leading figures and doctors in the movement? Are any famous French people or politicians vegan/WFPB? I am fascinated. I have watched a number of Italian videos on the topic to help sick friends in Italy, but it took forever to find the good ones. I would love to know more and where to start in the French scene. If you feel so inclined, I would be grateful, and you can contact me directly here, I think, or by searching my name and the word “dreams” on the net. ( I guess it would be poor taste to post my site here.) If you would like to write me in French I would be EVEN more grateful. My family has 3 generations of francophiles and francophones!wow milkThis is really comes as no surprise. Dean Ornish’s Spectrum “Most Healthy” Group 1 diet allows for low fat dairy and egg whites and his Group 3 Intermediate diet includes fish. He is not advocating an exclusively whole foods plant based diet, and I don’t really remember him ever doing so. He also is a paid consultant for McDonald’s Corporation. It doesn’t necessarily mean that he is compromising his principles and MickyD’s could certainly use all the nutritional guidance it can get, but it does call his credibility into question so I hope that he was commensurably remunerated for his good name and reputation.LOL, That’s just bizzaire.I’m highly skeptical that Dr. Ornish endorsed the creation or use of this marketing item. It’s true dairy was included in his earlier, but not later, programs which were published. His current Spectrum program seems to hold a truly plant based diet as the ideal, and simply encourages people to make as many changes as they are able and willing, in that direction. A quick search doesn’t reveal what this “Good to Know” program is or who is behind it; my hunch is that Safeway or another party erroneously connected the milk propaganda with an Ornish endorsement that was meant for something else. But let’s just look at the data rather than speculate about an individual and a marketing mess. Please see my comment in response to Dawn below.The sign itself says that this is a partnership between Ornish and Safeway. This partnership was also apparently covered as news for grocery industry insiders, e.g.:“The O organic line falls under the company’s strategy to be the health and wellness advocate for its shoppers. To do this it is leveraging existing assets, such as its pharmacy and family care centers and its relationship with Dr. Dean Ornish, to provide “good to know” brand communications throughout the store. It is also working with Tufts University and the USDA to develop a scorecard system that shoppers can use to measure the health value of the food they buy.”http://www.progressivegrocer.com/industry-news-trends/cpgs-trading-partners/safeway-outlines-6-fold-strategy-sustainable-double-digit-growth#sthash.Vec3yEXk.dpufMaybe it doesn’t represent Ornish’s true views, but it certainly seems that Ornish had ample opportunity to prevent this message from being connected with him if he didn’t want it to be.I have known Dean Ornish slightly since the late 80’s. (I attended his wedding, coached him in TV appearances.) Think of the attitude-shifting scientific and educational work he has done over the years! From what I have experienced of his personality and goals, It has been my guess and strong suspicion that Dean was dragged into writing The Spectrum by his experience that many people just won’t make HUGE shifts and need a slower, middle road to get going. Let us who are here on this site not forget that MANY people hear the word “vegan” or that there can be no meat or even just no cheese in a diet, and they SHUT DOWN and flee. Thanks to Dr. Greger’s Year-in-Review videos we were immediately convinced to go 100% WFPB, and the knowledge was sufficient to make the transition easy for us. But such has not been the case with most of our friends. We, who comment here, are apparently not the norm when it comes to eating for a fuller, healthier life. Dr. Greger’s videos on how even moderate shifts can help are worth remembering; and I think Dean Ornish, being one whose head can guide his appetites, probably has learned to include the many who have more difficulty.Right, and embracing a gradual approach to change is a different thing from specifically RECOMMENDING dairy.Of all the classic ‘milk is poopy food’ lectures out there, this one goes on about galactose more than the others. (see below.) OFF TOPIC: Now that America seems intent on eating its way out of the Asian carp invasion, I wonder if there are any studies showing if this stuff is just as ‘poopy’ as all the other fish flesh out there. Thanks for your consideration. http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2015/02/25/asian-carp-is-it-whats-for-dinner/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-PQCCiw_ZsSo, does this mean that yogurt is okay?Hi DanaB. Great question. All dairy products have lactose, which will contain galactose (the sugar found in milk that may be harmful). Yogurt may have a bit less galactose, but it is still there. Milk seems to be the most destructive of the dairy foods, but yogurt and other dairy products like cheese (although the research is mixed), have been associated with increased risk of insulin-like growth factor, which can boost other diseases risks. Another study shows higher intake of lactose (equivalent of 3 glasses of milk per day) may be associated with ovarian cancer risk. Hope that helps answer your question.JosephWhile maybe not as bad as milk, other dairy products are good for neither you, the dairy cows constantly impregnated and injected with hormones to artificially produce more milk, or the environment that is harmed by the factory farms that produce 95% of the meat and dairy consumed in North America (the UN Report “Livestock’s Long Shadow” is a good source of information). There are soy & coconut based yogurts that taste the same and are better in all three aspects.I am upset that my child is forced to take milk with his school lunch at his elementary school. I am confused because I have osteoporosis and Alendronate was prescribed along with direction to drink at least 2 glasses of milk a day and to take calcium as a supplement. I don’t like the side effects of the Alendronate. What is the plant based and most effective osteoporosis cure? I am now walking every day for 4 miles, eating plant based and feeling great. I stopped the Alendronate and don’t drink milk. I need the truth.Hi Dawn. Sorry to hear about your frustration with school lunch! Trust me, as a dietitian I too am fed up! Children are “forced” to take the milk because if the do not school will not be reimbursed. About osteoporosis we have a slew of videos and information on the site that can help.See what you find and let me know if you have any questions?Thanks, JosephI think a lot of my problems come from my years of grade school where I drank one thing a day of skim milk. I thought I was being smart by drinking the low fat kind. Sheesh. Some schools offer juices, but personally, if you can, I would pack them a lunch and put some cold brew tea in their thermos flavored with a bit of sugar. It tastes good, especially if they pick the kind of tea or herbal tea they like.Is osteoporosis REVERSAL a possibility? Dr Kepler gives a “recipe” here: “Osteoporosis can be readily reversed by (a) eliminating the above-named “calcium thieves” from one’s diet and (b) purchasing a weighted vest for about $50 (search for “Weighted Vest”) and wearing it while walking, doing housework, or most any activity for 20 – 40 minutes every day. Start with just one or 2 pounds and gradually work your way up to 10 or 12 lbs. With every step, a wave of weight goes down the spine, hips, and leg bones and the bones respond to the weight loads placed upon them. Bone density soon increases in a healthy, natural manner – not by taking drugs! Gradually increasing the weights over time, will ensure the bones continue to strengthen. For those who cannot wear such a vest, elastic resistance bands used regularly to build muscle will also build bone!”Dr. Klaper is an amazing doctor who gives his patients sound nutrition advice. I would stand by his recommendations, but it’s never a bad idea (and in fact always encouraged) to ask your own doctor about osteoporosis. In above comments many discuss another helpful book, “Building Bone Vitality” by Dr. Amy Lanou, which may offer suggestions.Hi Dawn. My favorite book on bone health is “The Whole-Body Approach to Osteoporosis” by R. Keith McCormick. So much fascinating information–It’s the only book I’ve ever read three times in a row! The detailed insightful information in this book complement Dr. Greger’s videos nicely.Dawn, can I ask what kind of side effects you were having with Alendronate? I too was prescribed Alendronate and have taken it for 1.5 months. Also do you know if it affects LDLs? Mine seemed suprisingly elevated today when i got my labs done. I have been on a WFPB diet for 4 years with great labs. thanks.Dawn: If I were a parent in a similar situation, I would be extremely frustrated. It’s terrible when the government pushes something unhealthy on children.For yourself, I think you might get some very good support from the book, “Building Bone Vitality: A revolutionary diet plan to prevent bone loss and reverse osteoporosis”. The book includes a chapter on medications as well as exercise, but is mostly about diet. I highly recommend ithttp://www.amazon.com/Building-Bone-Vitality-Revolutionary-Osteoporosis–Without/dp/0071600191/ref=sr_1_1_twi_1_pap?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1426543218&sr=1-1&keywords=building+bone+vitalityThe truth is short and sweet; cows milk is for baby cows.Completely agreehttp://saveourbones.com/osteoporosis-milk-myth/Dawn, I’m guessing you have asked the school to not give milk to your son? If so, would you be able to instruct your son to not drink the milk, and at the end of lunch return it? Maybe I’m being naive, but surely the school can’t force him to drink the milk.You could take lactaid. It is a scientific fact that the vast majority of your bones is made of phosphorous. Phosphorus is used in energy regulation, your body will salvage it from your bones for metabolism. You should make sure you get your daily minimum of phosphorus, but not too much as some people say high phosphorous can cause bone density loss.I highly recommend the book Building Bone Vitality by Amy Joy Lanou, Ph.D. and Michael Castleman. The foreward, incidentally, is by Dean Ornish. I’ve taken the liberty to reproduce one paragraph of it here: “Lanou and Castleman have analyzed more than twelve hundred studies showing that (1) the United States and other countries that consume the most milk, dairy, and calcium have the world’s highest fracture rates; (2) milk, dairy foods, and calcium supplements do not reduce fracture risk and in some studies increase it; and (3) a diet high in fruits and vegetables consistently improves bone mineral density and reduces fractures.”This is odd, since I remember a study or dietary report showing that vegans have a high rate of osteoporosis. This is something we shouldn’t kid ourselves about (for those of us who are vegan). It’s a serious health issue. I know a vegan who is osteoporotic (post-menopausal is my guess) and she suffers greatly with her back pain. I have some scoliosis and I am fine-boned, so this is something I really have failed to address properly in my diet. I know I need to tackle more greens, more tahini (sesame seed paste), more broccoli, and more regular use of almonds (although I’m pretty good with the almonds. Oh, I use ground almonds (almond flour) plus salt in a shaker to replace parmasean).http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/040114p32.shtmlhttp://www.theveganrd.com/2014/11/dietitian-perspectives-on-protein-calcium-and-vegan-bone-health.htmlhttp://www.veganhealth.org/articles/bones#fussI am trying to address this issue as I am vegan . Btw I like the idea of the almond flour In salt shaker.I’d like to hear more on fermented dairy as he suggested it may be a different story.Here’s a well referenced article on fermented dairy vs milk that you may enjoy. http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/pasteurized-milk-speeds-death-heart-disease-cancer-bone-fractures-yogurt-andHi C. Good question many folks are into fermented foods. Sometimes it is hard for researchers to control for fermented dairy, as dairy products usually get lumped into one category, or researchers look at dairy consumption by lactose content. One study found positive associations between intakes of total dairy foods, low-fat milk, and lactose and risk of ovarian cancer. When I search for other studies on yogurt many arise, but I am not confident that 100% of the time it is found harmless. If anyone can shed light on this topic I am all ears. When I think of why folks consume fermented dairy (yogurt and others) I believe it is for calcium, protein, and probiotics? The truth is very little probiotics exist and the probiotics found in yogurt are not naturally occurring because yogurt is pasteurized (killing all bacteria) and manufactures add back probiotics. Dr. Greger talks about paces to find probiotics. Lastly, protein and calcium can be obtained from many sources without running the risk of overdoing lactose consumption.JosephI thought they pasteurized the milk and then added the culture?Dr. Michael Klaper is pretty knowledeable in the area of probiotics. Check out this video. He discusses various probiotics at the 1:06.00 mark.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KatsJk0oBUIThanks MacSmiley for jumping in! Is that right? That sounds better than my answer. So yes, either way the cultures are added back into the product so essentially there is nothing unique about probiotics in cows yogurt.To add to the confusion:The most recent meta-analysis of dairy products and prostate cancer found an increased risk for yogurt intake–summary RR 1.08 per 100 grams/day based on five cohort studies. For cheese (often fermented), the summary RR was 1.10 per 50g/day based on 11 studies. (There was also an association with lowfat milk but surprisingly, whole milk was protective—but keep on reading for a suggestion as to why all these milk studies may be questionable.) (Abstract at http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2014/11/18/ajcn.113.067157)In contrast, the EPIC-Interact study in Europe showed an association between milk and Type 2 diabetes but found that fermented products (e.g., yogurt and cheese) were not associated with that disease.Fermentation destroys or attenuates the microRNA involved in milk signalling, says German dermatologist/researcher Dr. Bodo Melnik, who has written extensively on the many problems linked to milk–including acne and prostate cancer. (Links to Melnik’s studies are in this article:https://eatandbeatcancer.wordpress.com/2014/07/23/anti-cancer-diets-whats-the-deal-with-dairy/ )Melnik suggests that most epidemiological studies are flawed because, among other factors, they don’t take into consideration whether milk’s been treated to destroy the microRNA that trigger constant growth signalling. (Abstract at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25587719)Perhaps someone on your staff could have a look at the links above. I am in touch with Dr. Melnik and will ask him to comment further.It makes you wonder, where is the science that once told us milk was supposedly good for our bones?A few years back, Amy Joy Lanou did a thorough investigation of the research on dairy and bone health. Her book. “Building Bone Vitality” is worth the read. To learn more about her book click on the first link. One of the theories she cites in her book is the long held theory that diets high in animal protein cause bone loss. The second link takes you to an article that questions this theory. The third link is to Dr. Greger’s video on the research that puts this theory in question.http://www.wholefoodplantbasedrd.com/2013/09/osteoporosis-theres-more-to-the-story-than-calcium/http://www.wholefoodplantbasedrd.com/2013/12/animal-proteins-effect-on-bones-under-question/http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss/Thanks, Dominic.What am I missing? In a quick internet search of foods highest in galactose yields cooked celery. The list is mostly vegan with milk being way down the list?Galactose is not a just milk sugar, it is ubiquitous in animals and plants, Please see “Hidden Sources of Galactose in the Environment” Acosta PB, Gross KChttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7671974Interesting, Robert. Thanks for pulling that study. Do you know if the researchers found any negative associations with the free galactose found in plants? Seems to me the amount of galactose is very small in plant foods, I suspect negligible. I looked at a related article and found this 2014 study, A re-evaluation of life-long severe galactose restriction for the nutrition management of classic galactosemia. If this study holds true, all plant sources of galactose can be consumed except for fermented soy products, apparently.I never liked natto, and now I have science to prove my dislike is well founded!Apparently there are different pathways for metabolism. As usual, the plant one is probably innocuous.The study states: “Non-dairy sources of D-galactose are mainly cereals, vegetables, and fruits, but the concentration of galactose and the amount ingested from these sources accounts for a small proportion of the total intake of galactose. Put into perspective, the amount of lactose in one glass of milk corresponds to approximately 5 g of galactose, whereas the amount in 100 g of fruits or vegetables is measured in milligrams or tens of milligrams.”Hi Dr Greger! You may want to update the “vegan women have twins” link as it is mapping to your IBS video (which btw I enjoyed watching). Thanks so much for posting this type of information as so many healthcare professionals like myself don’t often have exposure in managing patients on a vegan diet. I have been vegan for approx 4 yrs, feel amazing and don’t plan on ever going back to ominovore diet. My PCP is happy w/ my labs and my quality of life is wonderful. Thnx again.Hi esme,Thanks for letting us know. I tried the link and it seemed to work. Can you double check for me please before I go knocking on the IT door? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-vegan-women-have-5x-fewer-twins/Thanks so much for the feedback. I am glad you appreciate the site and are able to utilize the resources. JosephI have always disliked milk even as a little kid, and even though it was pushed on me, I tried to avoid it…it made me feel like I was drinking mucous! I stopped drinking it as a beverage as soon as I could, but became lactose intolerant and sensitive to even the dairy included in other foods. Dairy contributed to a lot of issues for me that I didn’t even realize until I cut it out completely, which was probably the best single thing I could have done! Apparently, it applies to everyone! …and skimmed products can be even worse?I have no access to the study, but from what I’ve gleaned from other sources it seems to indicate that, among the women, three or more glasses of milk per day nearly doubled the incidence of death (by 93 percent) compared to those who drank none or less than one glass of milk per day.Then, when discussing cheese they say that, “Using this range[what does that mean??], incidence of deaths from cardiovascular disease decreased from 37-52%, and deaths from cancer decreased from 5-15% among women who ate 60 grams or more of cheese a day.I doubt they examined groups that only ate cheese and drank no milk, so is the decreased risk for mortality a reduction from those who drank less milk, or was it a reduction from the 93% increased risk from drinking milk?Does the study show that eating yogurt or cheese would still increase risk of mortality, just not as much as drinking milk would? In which case the lowest risk would be from no dairy, the next higher risk would be from fermented dairy, and the highest risk from milk. Is that an accurate assessment of the study?Also, I’d like to point out that women were studied for 20 years and men for only 11 and the cheese in question was fermented.Answered my own question. Here’s what the study says:” In a sensitivity analysis, the risk estimates of the outcomes associated with consumption of cheese or fermented milk products were in the opposite direction of estimates associated with milk consumption. Thus women with a high intake of cheese or fermented milk products compared with women with low intakes had lower mortality and fracture rates (see supplementary tables C and D). For each serving the rate of mortality and hip fractures was reduced by 10-15% (P<0.001). Risk reductions in men, based on a single exposure assessment, were more modest or were non-existent (see supplementary tables C and D).""Hi Val, You are spot on and bring up good points. Dr. Greger mentions that in the last portion of the video, how fermented products differed from regular milk. The accompanying editorial talks about the need for an extended trial. I also made a few comments about lactose and yogurt below if your interested.Still cant avoid pathogens even in pasteyrized milk or cheese http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11908-015-0463-zI found a free pdf of the study here: http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/349/bmj.g6015.full.pdfSInce becoming vegan I have avoided ALL dairy to the best of my ability. I adhere to Dr. Fuhrman’s GBOMBS rubric: greens, beans, onions, mushrooms, berries, nuts & seeds with starches and whole grains. Don’t know if I’ve gone overboard eating mostly RAW cruciferous vegetables (even sprouting my own broccoli seeds), flax seeds, organic Eden beans with kombu, drinking Eden soy milk, sometimes with kombu, etc. Just back from a checkup, test results are excellent, which is what you’d expect given a vegan lifestyle. However, my TSH was 0.11 & T4 free was 1.29, to be repeated in 3 months. I looked up hyperthyroidism, but most available information is about hypothyroidism, which seems to be a huge problem for women. Do I need 150 mg of iodine or a kelp food/supplement given all the goitrogenic foods I eat? Could not find dietary recommendations anywhere. Thanks for making this informative site available to the public.Hi Amanda. Good questions. These links should lead you in the right direction. And I know Dr. Fuhrman has a nice section on hypothyroidism on his site as well. I just wrote a section on this very topic, Should we take iodine supplements?. More on thyroid health from our site. Let me know if these help?Best, JosephGood luck on the Iodine. It seems to stop pain in it’s tracks. It’s a large atom that may be able to break down and get smaller ones stuck in it making your body work twice as hard to signal itself. Remember, just one half tea spoon salt a day or three nori sheets. Thank you for educating others.milk should be good for brain as that is the one thing that is growing very fast when a baby is born outside the womb as the brain program itself for the world it is born into.Smith, that’s what most of us are led to believe, but I don’t think there’s any problems with the brains of Asian children and adults who number ~4.3 billion and who never touch milk if raised on their traditional diets. But milk is the perfect food for baby cows who by the age of 16 months have grown into adulthood weighing between 1,000 to 1,800 lbs.What about lactose-free milk? Would it have less galactose, by any chance?Hi Jeffb, I think that lactose-free milk still would have galactose. Lactose-free milk from what I I understand only has lactase to help break down lactose into galactose and glucose, making it easier for those lactose intolerant.Smith, that’s what we’re all led to believe, but I don’t think there’s any problems with the brains of Asian children and adults who number ~4.3 billion and who never touch milk if raised on their traditional diets. But milk is the perfect food for baby cows who by the age of 16 months have grown into adulthood weighing between 1,000 to 1,800 lbs.Joseph is 100% correct here. By using Cron-O-Meter and looking at the nutrition info of fat-free lactose (Lactaid) milk, we can see that 1 cup contains 6.22 grams of both galactose and glucose. This is compared to regular fat free milk which contains 12.15 grams of lactose which contains a 1:1 ratio of galactose and glucose, so no change in total galactose content.I am not surprised that fermented dairy has less deleterious effects as milk. One thing I like to stress to people who cite dairy in the Mediterranean diet as a reason they continue to eat dairy is not only the limited amounts of dairy for Cretes, but it was eaten fermented: think blue cheese and yogurt. The Okinawans who do not consume dairy have an enviable lack of prostate and breast cancer. Today’s dairy, unfortunately also has higher levels of estrogen due to cow’s lactation through pregnancy- a common practice. This could mean a devastating spike in estrogen-positive breast cancer for dairy consumers or other unknown effects.The book “The China Study” confirms the truth on milkHello my friends. Thank you all for talking kind here :). I was thinking… If the lactose is the problem, is the problem solved by drinking lactose free milk? I have been told before that the real problem is not the lactose, but the milk protein. I am a little confused now.The time difference tells me to go to bed now but I hope for an answer from you :). Good night from Denmark.Hi Macro. Lactose-free milk would still have galactose (see my comment below), from what i understand. And you raise a good point, as some studies find animal protein itself is potentially harmful. We know that milk and dairy protein can increase prostate cancer risk. There is a good chapter in this review on dairy products and prostate cancer. We also see a great explanation on milk and prostate cancer from this video. Hope this helps.JosephThank you very much Joseph. And by the way, welcome on board :).Very interesting. If only more people could hear this message.Journal of GeriontologY M55 (2000) Department of Medicine at the University of California “A high ratio of vegetable to animal protein was found to be impressively associated with a virtual disappearance of bone fractures.” Fully supported by scientific analysis. Also, worldwide, the high dairy regions are exactly the osteoporosis regions. Do note these are also high meat regions.So, following the tradition of including unrelated questions, …So, what’s with this B17 stuff?I was told that this was a reference:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18760245… but lacking a subscription, I can’t verify.Hi :) Loved your segue BTW :) No clinical data to suggest B17 necessary or helpful. Cochrane analysis 2011 came out against the substance due to side effect of cyanide poisoning! If you want that full text article you mentioned, I can send it to you. (Couldn’t figure out how to attach it, so just send a note to info@nutritionfacts.org)How did Sam Simon die of cancer at age 59 when he was a vegan for 15 years?Crystal, vegan is a statement of what you don’t eat, not what you do. So it is possible that Simon had some pretty bad dietary habits, just that those habits didn’t include eating any animal derived foods. After all a lunch of sugared Coke and a pack of Twizzlers would be still be vegan. Or it could have been that he had excellent plant-based diet full of whole foods with minimal processed foods and still developed cancer. And remember that if he was a vegan for 15 years, that means that he wasn’t for 44 years. It very well could have been that he developed colon cancer before his switch to a better diet and it was his diet that retarded the progression an already very advanced cancer enough that he lived to 59 instead of dying at say 49.But just because one person who followed a vegan diet developed cancer doesn’t mean that improving ones diet isn’t a very worthwhile goal. Diet is probably plays the largest single role in the development and progression of cancer, but it isn’t the sole determiner. So while people who eat a whole food plant based diet with lots of greens, whole grains, legumes, fruits and nuts their entire life have a cancer rate that is a fraction of the general population, it isn’t zero. This means that there will be some people who will develop cancer and die from it regardless of how good their diet is.In a similar case, people ask if a vegan diet is so good for you, how then did Steve Jobs die of pancreatic cancer after being vegan for so long, with the implication that since the diet failed in this situation for this one person, them maybe it doesn’t really do much for making sure that we don’t get cancer or that if we do, doesn’t keep us from dying from it. Dr. McDougall had a very interesting response to the critics of a plant based diet who used the case of Steve Jobs as evidence that it doesn’t work. It is a little long, but very informative.https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/videos/free-electures/why-did-steve-jobs-die/Thank you so much for your detailed response! : )Hey Dr ! I m 21 years old girl , and facing many problems regarding low hemoglobin level and iron level may bone are very weak and physique is childish with 5 foot height and 40 kg weight …Please suggest some sort of diet plan or food so that I will follow this and improve my health and also suggest something to improve my height and physique…Thank youPlease tell me some duet plan to improve health …I am 21 year old girl with 5 ft height and 40 kg weight I am facing problems regarding low Hemoglobin and iron level .My bones are weak and my physique is childish please suggest some diet plan so that I I’ll be able to improve my health and physique… Thank youHi Sadia, First I just wanted to share with you that after going vegan, my hemoglobin levels increased from 11.8 to 13.7 g/dL with no supplementation. As a woman, I went from being considered technically anemic to having a quite healthy hemoglobin level. Prior to going vegan I was mostly vegetarian out of habit and did eat plenty of beans and some fruits and veggies, but my vegetable (especially dark leafy greens), fruit, and overall vitamin C intake increased significantly when I eliminated even the fairly small amount of animal products I was eating. I just wanted to share my story to give you some hope.For an overview of iron in vegan and non-vegan diets, I think this summary by registered dietitian Jack Norris is one of the most comprehensive I’ve seen: http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/ironIn particular, the Jack Norris article contains a table with some plant foods that have the highest iron content: http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/iron#table1Once you have improved your iron intake, you can take additional steps to improve your body’s absorption of that iron. Several informational videos are available on this site with tips such as eating Vitamin C rich foods with your iron rich foods (to some extent this occurs naturally with plant foods), eating onions and garlic with iron rich foods, and avoiding tea and coffee at meals:http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-mineral-absorption-enhancers-found/ http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/11/01/how-to-enhance-mineral-absorption/ http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/can-tea-hinder-the-absorption-of-iron/For bone health, avoiding phosphates in meat products and cola, and eating beans and whole grains appear to be beneficial:http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-osteoporosis/ http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/20/how-beans-help-our-bones/Vitamin D and calcium are necessary for bone health as well. Similarly to iron, calcium can be found in a variety of foods (often the same foods highlighted for high iron content) such as dark leafy greens, broccoli, beans, calcium-set tofu, nuts, and certain fruits. If you struggle to raise your intake sufficiently through foods, you may consider fortified food products such as cereals or plant milks, however be aware that calcium supplementation has been called into question in recent years due to possible negative effects on cardiovascular health. You can see Dr. Greger’s recommendations for Vitamin D supplementation (based on geographic location, but only for northern hemisphere residents) here: http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/01/vitamin-d-from-mushrooms-sun-or-supplements/ [If you are in the sourthern hemisphere, perhaps you can still guess based on what you think is an appropriately analogous location.]Also, weight bearing exercise such as walking and strength training is extremely important for bone health, particularly in women and those with slim figures. This page provides a nice introduction to exercise and bone health. You can find plenty of information elsewhere on the internet for specific programs or exercises: http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00674I hope that helps Sadia! And while strong bones and good hemoglobin levels are excellent goals, I hope you don’t consider your height or natural build something that needs to be fixed. Health and vitality is beautiful at any height with any body type. All the best to you.I have a comment. I recently learned after 33 years of being a milk drinker that I have a strong lactose intolerance, like 2/3 of all Americans. You can diagnose yourself: do you have dark shades or bruises underneath your eyes and upside down smiley faces beneath your nails? If you so, your dreaded dream has come true: you are allergic to milk like 200 million other Americans. You can buy some lactaid pills and milk will be good for you again. Or use lactaid milk. Maybe even have a slice of pizza with a lactaid pill. The pain your stomach must ignore by way of brain signaling from all the lactose bacteria fighting. Those identifiers will go away immediately upon not drinking milk. I do not think it is calcium bones need to be strong. 80 percent or more of the bones in your body is made of phosphorous, not calcium. Phosphorus as a power is also white like calcium. I am now a lactose intolerant would-be vegetarian. On my to vegan. There could be a study to see if phosphorous builds strong bones. Phosphorous is the energy molecule of the whole world, in ATP, and as you age, your body steals phosphorous from your bones. You could see if drinking a diet soda a day (lots of phosphorus), can add to bone health. Remember to bruise with a base afterwards. Milk does have complete protein if you want to get away from sulfur containing amino acids for life extension. I have heard that phosphorus is not good for bones but I do not agree and have no evidence or way to test this, my opinion. Watch TV to see who has a milk allergy. It’s all around and we have gotten used to it.Hi Matthew, have you seen this video of Dr Greger’s regarding phosphorus?http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/From the video: “It’s thought to […] hurt our bones, by contributing to osteoporosis by disrupting hormonal regulation.”Article cited is available in free full text here: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2013/05/29/ajcn.112.053934.full.pdf+htmlCaution should be used when recommending increased phosphorus in the diet. Americans already consume much more than the recommended amount and there are numerous negative health effects associated with it.Dear b00mer, Thank you for this post. I hope all Americans get their minimum and do not give themselves a phosphorous shortage. Still most of our bones are made of phosphorous and not calcium. I am sorry for my bad advice. Phosphorous is used every day in anergy cycling. Going from ATP to ADP to AMP, and waiting to add more phosphorus. The drugs they made for osteoporosis, don’t work, and they make people real sick. They all sound kinda like phosphorous too, like phosomax. Too much phosphorous can cause kidney failure, too little can lead to real weak metabolism. I hope there is a happy minimum, as this is my own idea about how the veins can actually eat through bone with hunger.What kind of measurement are you using when saying most of our bones are made of phosphorous and not calcium? What’s your source?Please see http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/bones/structure.php“bone mineral itself has Ca:P ratios ranging from 1.37 – 1.87″More Phosphorus than Calcium in the mineral.Please forgive the error. I retract here. Bone is not 85 percent Phosphorous. However, Bone is a store house of Phosphorous, as 85 percent of it is in the bone.http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/phosphorus“About 85% of phosphorus in the body can be found in bones and teeth, but it is also present in cells and tissues throughout the body. ”Source: Phosphorus | University of Maryland Medical Center http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/phosphorus#ixzz3Ug84dfY2 University of Maryland Medical Center Follow us: @UMMC on Twitter | MedCenter on FacebookPhosphorous is an essential element in nutrient cycling and I believe we know the body robs the bones for a nutrient. I do not think Calcium is as well used.Thank you and please let me know if there is any additional information I can provide.MatthewX:Y > 1 means that X/Y > 1 means that X>Y. That is, your quoted ratio implies more calcium than phosphorous.The opposite! if you had 50 grams Calcium to 100 grams Phosphorus The ratio would be .5 50/100. In this example, 50 grams of Calcium would mean 68 – 93 grams phosphorous. The second divisor in your example inverts that inequality sign as you have it written. All apologies!Sorry. I see my error. You have 37 or 87 percent more Calcium than phosphorus in the bones. Phosphorus is still a main component of bones.No animal products for 8 weeks now no milk products for 15 months, and I ordered a vegetarian plate for the first time in my life today, clueless what it was supposed to be, what do I get? CHEESE on bread :( I guess my food ordering skills need some work. :)What a hoot!Unfortunately vegetarian means no meat but dairy and eggs are ok. I’ve been invited to vegetarian potlucks and it has been very difficult to find something to eat.I am wondering what it is in dairy galactose that is so detrimental as opposed to vegetal or mushroom galactose.My understanding as someone with a vague knowledge of sugar polymers: In dairy lactose, galactose is connected to glucose by a β1→4 linkage that is rapidly cleaved by lactase so the galactose is available in the small intestine. In vegetal or mushroom arabinogalactans the linkages are β1→5 and β1→6 and in galactoligosaccharides (stachyose, raffinose), the galactose(s) the linkages are α1→6, which can only be digested by bacterial enzymes in the colon. In other words, milk galactose gets absorbed, while much vegetal galactose functions as prebiotic.Thanks Darryl for this reply.I still don’t know if yogurt is good? Is there video done on Yogurt as I can’t find one. ThanksHi, Kris. Here are all videos where Dr. Greger talks about yogurt. Not sure about homemade yogurt? Some studies have seen an increased risk of prostate cancer with yogurt consumption. It may not be the added or natural sugars in yogurt, but the actual dairy protein itself that may be harmful.hi i am 7 years old childHi MilkTeaShake! Welcome to learning about good food.thank you for informationHi all- First post! I take a PPi for Barrett’s Oesophagus which drains calcium from my bones. I have a small frame and my mother has osteoporoses. So was advised by doctor to take citrical + D for calcium . I have also decided to take magnesium and vit K after doing my own research. I have been vegan for 2.5 years. I try very hard to eat whole foods every day at every meal. I get no praise from any Doctors or specialists who find I am vegan although my blood work is always fine. I have taken up more exercise classes as of January 2015. I am 46 years old. Is there anything else I should be monitoring for bone health? Many thanks for your input.Kym: I don’t know what a PPi is nor Barrett’s Oesophagus, but you mentioned osteoporoses and bone health. I think the following book is so helpful in understanding what we can do for bone health: “building bone vitality: A Revolutionary diet Plan to Prevent Bone Loss and Reverse Osteoporsis”. The answer is basically a whole plant food diet, but the book has a lot of general information about bones and specific nutrients as well as recipes that might help you tweak your diet. Maybe some of this information would be helpful to your situation???If you are interested, this is the book: http://www.amazon.com/Building-Bone-Vitality-Revolutionary-Osteoporosis–Without/dp/0071600191/ref=sr_1_1_twi_1_pap?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1426875889&sr=1-1&keywords=building+bone+vitalityHi Thea. I will definitely get that book. It sounds like a great reference for both myself and Mum. Thanks!Kym, One other factor might be the amount of phosphorous in your diet, especially the type that is highly absorbable. By eating a WFPB diet, you are definitely moving the right direction since meat, meat additives, and dairy contain very high levels of bio-available phosphorous. Another source is sodas which use phosphorous to stabilize them so that they don’t form so many advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Dr. Greger did a three video series on phosphorus. The key with respect to bone health is that excess phosphorous disrupts the activation of Vitamin D from its storage form to its active form. This is the first in that series.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/Thanks for your reply. I will look into phosphorous. Thankfully I dislike sodas, so that isn’t an issue for me. Cheers, Kym.Well, if we are trying to avoid galactose (and I agree we should), let’s not forget to avaid the foods with the highest amounts: Celery; Beets; basil; Honey & Sweet Cherries! :-)Hi Dr, McAnsh,I looked into this and to my knowledge plant sources of galactose don’t seem to be problematic. More of my comments below, if interested. Thanks for your post.JosephThank you Dr. Gonzales. I’ve read where they use galactose to accelerate aging in animal studies and wondered how it might affect humans?…Are there ways to remove the less desirable parts of milk other than fermentation? Such as, heating or boiling?what about yogurt? has the same problems with th D-galactose? thank´s.Not sure. It may be dairy protein in particular, at least regarding prostate cancer risk I commented below. See if my links help?Thanks, JosephOk perfect, thank you!Hi Dr! I want to known, what do you think about this relation between phosphate dairy products and cancer?:Nutr Cancer. 2010;62(3):297-9. doi: 10.1080/01635580903407221.Dairy products and prostate cancer risk.Newmark HL1, Heaney RP.Author informationAbstractIncreased calcium intake from dairy products has been suggested as a risk factor for prostate cancer. We propose that the high dietary phosphate of dairy products may more readily explain this risk rather than the increased calcium. Several epidemiologic correlations have indicated an increased risk of prostate cancer with long-term, high intake of dairy products in male U.S. physicians and males in Sweden. This relation has been mechanistically associated with the higher dietary intake of calcium in dairy products. We propose, however, that the high dietary phosphate of dairy products affects much larger fluctuation in serum phosphate and may be a more likely source of prostate cancer risk from high dietary intake of dairy products.Thay suggest more relation between cancer with phosphate than calcium.thanks.http://raypeat.com/articles/articles/milk.shtmlThe dairy board is not going to like these findings. Can you hear ¨class action suit¨ being muttered in the wings after hearing ¨Milk does a body good!¨ for the zillionth time?Aniseed to help prevent bone loss? This study might be worth a look by Dr. Greger. http://nwpii.com/ajbms/papers/AJBMS_2011_1_06.pdf I guess this herb is sent packing (to my mother ^^ :)Aniseed may be super healthful as a spice, but I am not sure about bone health? I hope it is! I think that study was conducted on rats? Do you see any others focusing on human populations? Thanks, Holden!Glad to help.I’m positively surprised that Dr. Greger didn’t let his vegan agenda get in the way of mentioning (albeit briefly) the positive effects of fermented dairy observed in the Swedish cohort.Before the publication of the Swedish study, I wrote a summary here providing an extensive list of pubmed papers showing beneficial effects of dairy for CVD and metabolic syndrome/type II diabetes. Those studies usually didn’t discern between milk and fermented dairy, but those who did found more benefits from the latter. This is the first epidemiological study however, showing such significant opposite effects of milk vs. fermented dairy.The authors’ conclusion is that the reduced galactose content due to fermentation may be responsible for these effects. This may be true for cheese, which usually contains only trace amounts of lactose and galactose, but does not explain the magnitude of difference in the outcomes with regard to yogurt, as the galactose content of yogurt is reduced only by about 20-30% by fermentation and in low- and non-fat yogurt the lactose content is usually even higher than in milk because additional milk powder is added to improve taste and texture. My take is that we should not once again step in the reductionist trap here and reduce the health effects of a complex food to one of its main compounds. It may be that reduced galactose levels contributes to the health benefits of yogurt over milk, but there have to be some additional beneficial compounds derived from fermentation being responsible for the observed difference.That’s actually good news for vegans, as it now seems likely that fermented plant-based milk may provide similar health benefits as traditional yogurt, without having to worry about galactose.I quit drinking cow’s milk over a decade ago. http://alkalinehealth.net/creamy-smoothie-dairy-free/The jury is out whether it’s good for bones or not. Milk has too many downsides for the average person. Milk is generally fed to babies to make them grow, thus if one is trying to maintain their weight or lose it, milk is not good. Also known to cause stuffiness and inflammation. If an active person is looking to gain weight, they’d probably benefit from a good portion of the 3.25% chocolate milk after a workout.Aside from that, it should probably be avoided.Fermented dairy on the other hand has many more benefits, but if you want compare it to say fermented cabbage (sauerkraut), sauerkraut wins hands down. Both provide the same benefit to the body minus the additional effects that sauerkraut won’t provide.What about milk kefir? I am taking kefir, about 3 cups per week (1 liter) a week for gut health. It is made using store bought milk as there is no organic or fresh source available. I cannot locate any study on this.One of our star NF volunteers made a comment about Kefir grains long ago. I think you can buy the grains and use them in basically any liquid to make “kefir”. There are a ton of studies on this stuff just like there are regarding probiotics, as it is basically a probiotic. More research articles on kefir can be found here.Thank you sir for the fast reply. Will do some more reading at your site and the links. I was just introduced to this site,and will send my friends over as well. Appreciate the great and informative work you guys are are doing.Reposting on behalf of Richard:“A friend asked me if there were any proven health benefits to be gained by eating animal bone marrow? Has Dr Greger done any research on this topic?”Good question, Richard. I haven’t seen any research on the benefits of eating bone marrow, but many folks use animal bones to make broth. Even there I cannot find any studies (if someone can that would be great) to support bone broth. I find Dr. Katz’s article helpful, Bone Broth and Magic Beans.","['adolescence', 'aging', 'animal studies', 'bone fractures', 'bone health', 'bone mineral density', 'brain disease', 'brain health', 'cancer', 'cardiovascular disease', 'children', 'dairy', 'fermented foods', 'galactose', 'galactosemia', 'Harvard', 'heart disease', 'inflammation', 'lactose', 'lifespan', 'longevity', ""men's health"", 'milk', 'mortality', 'osteoporosis', 'oxidative stress', ""women's health"", 'yogurt']","The galactose in milk may explain why milk consumption is associated with significantly higher risk of hip fractures, cancer, and premature death.","What can we do for our bones, then?

The only remaining issue (and I consider this an inconvenience rather than a medical problem) I have from when I was an omnivore is exactly what you describe above, in terms of having to get up several times each night to urinate and sometimes urgently needing to urinate, especially after drinking coffee. I am now a long distance runner, and the biggest inconvenience involves having to stop to urinate during marathons, it costs me a few minutes from my time. I now only drink water and green tea, with a cup of coffee every other day or so. I don’t use any medications, not even Advil, and would not take any medications unless needed to save my life. I had always assumed my frequent and urgent urination issue would become lessened over time on my vegan diet, but it hasn’t. Is there anything I can consume to help with this that doesn’t involve medication?Mr. Eric,As a retired natural nutritionist who was in practice for many years, I came to realize that the one thing men were overlooking in dealing with prostate issues from a holistic approach was NOT drinking chemically treated water, especially fluoridated water which most municipal water supplies are. You may be interested to know that there is an under-the-kitchen-sink reverse osmosis water filter [r.o. is the most efficient for removing pollutants] that costs around $200.00 plus installation. You then use that water for drinking, cooking, food prep, and all beverages, including ice making. That just may be the missing link you are looking for. That suggestion used to help other men. Good luck!Hi Catherine, thank you for your response! What you suggest is the one thing I haven’t tried. I installed a ceramic based filter a while back, which I use for all my drinking water. But there are issues with my municipal water here, not just flouridation but also polutants such as hexavalent chromium that I know are not removed by a ceramic filter. My company makes water filtration systems and I really have no excuse for not installing a reverse osmosis system. Thank you again for your suggestion.Hi Eric. What is the progress 11 months later after you fitted the reverse osmosis filter?Coffee unfortunately does the same thing to me. Don’t forget as well that you take in a lot of fluid from the numerous fruits and veggies I’m sure you eat, even apart from water consumed on its own.Pingback: Dr. Greger: Treating an Enlarged Prostate With Diet()Could you write an article on how not only to prevent the recurrence of crohn’s and ulcerative colitis symptoms but to treat these intestinal disease with diet. I have noticed that even though I am eating a very healthy vegan diet my symptoms came back. They are much less than before I was vegan, but I want to heal my inflamed intestines.Are any studies out there on liquid or fasting diets to treat that?Lauritz, you must read Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Prof John Hunter. And Breaking the Vicious Cycle by Elaine Gottschall.I developed BPH while on a whole plant based diet. It is supposedely very common in older menI went vegetarian at age 45, ten years ago, and have been eating a low fat whole food vegan diet high in whole food starches (but eating a lot of fruits and vegetables) for most of the 10 years. I was diagnosed with BPH approx. 3 years ago and have the symptom of a sudden and frequent need to urinate, but do not have the symptom of feeling an incomplete emptying of the bladder. I have heard BPH does NOT increase the odds of prostate cancer. I sometime think the frequent peeing is due to all the liquid I eat in my food, but the doc did say the prostate was enlarged. I also wonder if it is related to the bedwetting problem I had when I was a child. According to Dr. McDougall, bedwetting has been linked to dairy consumption.I have a request of you. You obviously know your stuff and can help a lot of people. The one request, or perhaps suggestion might be a better word, would be to team up with a nutritionist/author that could complement your knowledge with a cook book that shows us how to prepare the best food ingredient options, to get the most benefit from the food suggestions you make. I would buy it in a heartbeat! Most articles I read (not yours of course) only tell what NOT to eat or drink, (which is usually everything we currently consume) but there is no REAL alternatives given. In other words a lot of don’t but very, very few dos! If there are already recepe books that you know of, please suggest them. Buy the way, what do you eat? My e-mail address is hlindseyjr@aol.com. I would buy the book in a heartbeat! Thank you for your work!

Find my suggestion http://www.homehealthplanet.com/single.php?id=219Maybe you need eyeglasses! BPH is covered in the article and who is paying you to advertise Saw Palmetto when there is no evidence that it helps BPH? Given today’s evidence I do not see any better solution for BPH than your diet…Saw palmetto plus flax and plant based diet helped my bph dramatically. Saw palmetto is the most important factor after testing each piece.I remember reading a study on coagulation and lignins, and recall lentils can increase platelet aggregation in humans? SO one needs to be careful if are prone to hypercoagulable state such as those with lipid abnormalities.Lignans, along with other antinutrients, are eliminated with cooking. So its not a concern unless you are eating raw lentils. Soaking and sprouting also significantly reduces lignan content.Thanks Toxins, good to know;)Thanks? That is bad information! Lignans are good for the gut and fight some cancers. Additionally, cooking does not destroy them… If your problem is really lignans you are especially going to have to avoid flax, cooked or otherwise. Sprouting flax seeds increases the lignans so the comment you are addressing is just garbage.Flax seeds is linhac(ss sound)a in Portugues? Here the golden one is considered the best one.Is magnetotherapy could be efficient , for example Androspok device? TnxMy husband has been taking Saw Palmetto for prostate health, but just learned at least one study showed no positive impact. Could you share the latest clinical studies? Thank You!Hi Gale. Best to discuss supplement options with your husband’s doctor. Some clinical trials found reduced inflammation of the prostate when taking saw palmetto, lycopene, and selenium (aka: Serenoa repens). Another study did not find any benefit from saw palmetto alone. I don’t think there is enough evidence to support it’s use for prostate health. However, if there are not major side effects (which it does not appear there are) and it will not not cause further harm, then I see no concerns trying it with doctor consent. Hope this help. I think addressing diet is far more important. I know we’ve been in touch about that via FaceBook. I appreciate your patience. Thanks, JosephHello, I am having good luck with 80% vegetarian and some fish, usually just some Salmon and a bit of tuna, wild. I feel my symptoms are getting lighter. I did want to give a shout out for egg whites though. I stopped eating the yolk about two years ago and find the protein a great one. You mentioned not eating eggs?

I do all kinds of veggies, grains, legumes, even make cheeze out of nuts and stuff…but I don’t do meat. LOLI’ve just watched the video again – I see what you mean – I was trying to suggest that the eating of fermented foods might alleviate the symptons of those with Crohn’s or inflammatory bowel – I know what I meant, it’s just my grasp of the English language often lets me down…..On a different tangent, I’m about to experiment with fermentation this week – I will try soya beans and black beans. As is usual with the interweb, I’m reading conflicting information on almost every “experts” page, so can you stear me in the right direction as to what has worked for you.Here’s my cunning plan – I have to pre-soak, then cook the beans. Once cooked you place the beans into a saline solution (sea salt) of 2 tbsp of salt to 1 litre of purified water. Add the beans to the container, add the saline solution to the beans, cover with a cabbage leaf (or other suitable vegetable) to immerse the beans fully. Close the lid, burp the container regularly, after 7-10 days either place in the fridge or freeze.I intend to freeze my beans after fermentation – do you know if it is safe to eat them from the freezer without re-heating them, as by doing so will destroy the benefiical bacteria.Also, can you leave the beans fermenting at room temperature for say one month, or do they have to be put into the fridge after 7-10 days,,,,,,ThanksHey! I love your adventurous spirit! Be warned fermenting beans can be quite “fragrant”! LOL! You have the procedure down fine, definitely cooking them first, but I might be inclined to “burp” the beans more often, maybe even daily, unless you fit your jars with an airlock, similar to the ones used in wine making. Remembering to “burp” is also a good opportunity to taste your bean brew to see where it is at. Preferences vary. Remember, lacto-fermenting tend to “sour” food (think sauerkraut) and the longer it ferments the more pronounced it becomes…but also the higher the microbes! I find here where it is warm in FL, a week is usually more than enough, but results can vary widely depending on the temperatures. I hear that beyond a certain point the beneficial microbes decrease, but not sure what that point is for each food. Yes you can freeze and defrost them afterwards without heating, but know too that they will keep in their jars in your fridge for quite a while! This slows fermentation to a crawl, but doesn’t stop it. Oh, and good to keep in mind….If you are new to eating fermented foods, start slow and work up. Our bodies seem resistant to big changes, even when it is beneficial, so don’t over-do at first. The pay off is great and well worth it!!! I used to hate vinegars, kraut, anything sour flavored, but since starting this I have become addicted and have been fermenting everything in sight! Even the wild cactus in the yard became an ingredient in fermented salsa! LOL! Lots of fun, economical and healthy too! What more can I ask for! My next venture is using fungi to ferment beans, as in tempeh! I was excited to find out I could use any kinds of beans and even grains, I just have to find a good source for the innoculant! Then I discover I can make a totally convincing range of vegan cheeze from nuts, plant based yogurt, seeds, etc. using various culture media to create (like a little liquid from your lacto-fermented brews, miso, PB yogurt, etc.) You could not believe how awesome they are! Miyoko Schinner has a book out called “Artisan Vegan Cheese” that details it for you. She also has quite a few videos on Youtube and her own website and forum. For all the very best general fermenting info, I would definitely send you here: http://www.wildfermentation.com/who-is-sandorkraut/ Sandor Katz has literally written the book(S) on reviving the art of fermentation from all over the world! The above link will give you a bit of info and also has links to his forum and other resources! Enjoy and best of luck to you! PS…you said English wasn’t your native language? Could have fooled me! I wish I had your fluency! Where are you from?Hi CharzieThanks for the info – I came across some videos re making vegan cheese (how amazing!), and also one with Sandor Katz already – I’ve spent a few hours watching them last night and this morning.Apologies for throwing you a curve ball re my nationality – I’m a Londoner, I was just being self deprocating, sorry…….C’mon down! LOL! Glad you are having fun with the microbes! Once you have a few good outcomes, it’s fun to just mess around and experiment a bit! As long as it’s vegetable matter, and isn’t growing too much hair, you’re safe! (Exaggerating a wee bit! LOL)Sprouting the beans will unlock the natural enzymes that will aid in digestion.I sprout a LOT! But some beans (and I’d have to research the exact reason again) like kidney beans, soy, etc. are always recommended to be cooked before eating even when sprouted.I ferment my beans regularly. Many people claim that beans are hard to digest. I figure fermenting them will make them easier to digest and give me some pro-biotics. I always soak dry beans in non chlorinated or chloraminated water for 24 hours first and pour off the water. At first, I cooked beans, added kefir and left them out over night and for one day until I could smell it. Now I take out just a bit-like 2 golf balls worth of the last batch and backslop it onto the new batch. Yes that is a fermenting term. I spread it around but put it into the fridge. It is fermented enough the next morning. WHen Dr. Greger and others started saying, “YOu should eat beans every day” I started worrying, “How am I going to do this? ” I also eat a lot of Trader Joe’s hummus with sesame seeds, amla powder, and freshly chopped garlic in it. John SHi John – thanks for the info – here’s my cunning plan.I intend to soak my soy beans overnight in filtered water. I will then sprout them for 3-5 days and then lacto ferment them for 7-10 days. I have read that the beans should be cooked at some stage, but I’ve also read that they don’t require cooking, so I’m not going to cook my first batch to see how they come out. I will then freeze them, and then eat them (de-frosted) without re-heating as suggested by Charzie above (thanks again Charzie)……Oooo, let me know how THAT version goes! I also like to sprout, but not all legumes digest real well even afterwards for me, and certain ones if I recall, they tell you, you need to cook. Soybeans for sure… not too clear on the others off hand. I was curious to try on the ones I have eaten sprouted raw, but never have yet, so I’d love to know how it goes! I hear the raw fermented beans smell so bad, they are hard to tell from rotten…so be prepared! LOL!if you are absolutely eating them raw, just a few the first day to see what your tummy thinks: I went to a veggie conference in ’97 that poisoned dozens with raw sprouted beans, sadly.I bet that curtailed the sale of sprouting products for a few months……lolWhere’s your spirit of adventure? You can’t call it fermenting if you do it all in the fridge! LOL!I also make kombucha, sour beer, miso and natto. The natto i get spores and steam the beans in the steam oven for 3 hours add the spores when cool and incubate fo r 24 hrs at 104F in a closed container with water in the incubator to keep from drying out. Then refrigerate and eat with mustard (made by fermenting mustard seeds in the kombucha) and some of my sauer kraut. The natto is truly an acqiired taste, used to buy it frozen at HMart (throw the sauce packet aeay – it is usually fish and chemicals). Will try some adzuki beans next. The Miyoko book mentioned earler is a good one I make the almond yogurt all the time it is like creme freishe. The miso takes forever. Today I am trying to make my first batch of sake!I’d never heard of Natto until yesterday, I’m such a vegan philistine……I would have to agree, it’s an acquired taste – the beans look like they are covered in spiders webbing – how someone first discovered this and thought it would be edible is beyond me – maybe it was in a dark cave long before electricity.In saying that, I’m tempted to try making it, but I will probably buy an off the shelf version first – and throw away the fish chemicals as per your advise….Good advice, toss the chemicals! LOL! My first natto experience… I bought a package of 3 little servings to try because I was leery, liked it enough to use the last one to culture my own beans! It worked too, though they weren’t soybeans, and they weren’t as stringy, I enjoyed them and will try again!Fermenting is so cool! I LOVE natto, I don’t see why everyone thinks it’s so gross, even the stringy part is doable! I guess we all have different tastes for sure! We should all get on a fermenting board and trade tales and spare these poor folks! LOL!What happens to the sulfur in allium and cruciferous vegetables?That was my question! Did a whole video about it–stay tuned! If you haven’t already you can subscribe here (for free like everything on the site).My question too! I look forward to the findings.Dr. Greger, while you’re at it, it would be of great value if you could comment to your NutritionFacts followers regarding the announcement today that the U.S. dietary recommendations no longer suggest limiting dietary cholesterol intake. What are we to think? What does the science say? You are the go-to man for guidance.Hello Steve! If you look and search at nutritionfacts for “cholesterol”, you will find the answer about your question on Dr. Greger thoughts about cholesterol. I think he can’t say much more about that, since he already show us almost everything that science have to say about cholesterol and health.Filipe. Thanks for your thoughts. Here are more of mine. I did review past NutritionFacts videos and found very little on dietary cholesterol. The only explicit statement I found on the connection between dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol was the 35 year followup of the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study, and that type of study can only show an association, which is confounded by the alignment of total fat, saturated fat, dietary cholesterol and eating patterns. [The whole new dietary cholesterol guideline may be moot since the guidelines continue to limit saturated fats and most sources of dietary cholesterol are also rich in saturated fats (with the exception of fish and eggs).]But still, I believe a targeted, through response to the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee would be valuable, both for me as a nutritionist, and for the lay public. I’m not as jaded as Dommy’s post, below. I assume there are bright minds and committed scientists who sit on that committee. This is a puzzlement and I’d like to know what’s going on. As Dr. Greger has stated, confusion is the tool of choice of the industries that produce unhealthy products, from tobacco to eggs. Those with standing, like Dr. Greger, can help clear up the confusion.Here, the latest one: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-cholesterol-level/And here (all the videos (and they are so many) where this topic is also approached): http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/Filipe,The video you indicated, The Optimum Cholesterol Level, is exclusively about SERUM cholesterol and does not mention dietary cholesterol, which is the issue with the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee’s new recommendation.And Dr. Greger’s essay on cholesterol you provided a link to, updated just two days ago, also does not provide any science on the contribution of dietary cholesterol to serum cholesterol, particularly LDL.So, I’m still hoping for a science-backed statement, as Dr. Greger does so well, that clarifies the confusion.These recent articles from Dr. Neal Barnard are some of the best responses I’ve seen to The Dietary Guideline Advisory Committee’s latest recommendationshttp://www.pcrm.org/nbBlog/index.php/cholesterol-confusion-lets-make-sense-of-it/http://www.pcrm.org/nbBlog/index.php/new-dietary-guidelines-the-good-the-bad-and-the-downright-confusing/Dominic, Thank you so much. This is exactly what I was hoping for, an authoritative, respected spokesperson addressing the issue head on and clarifying it. Dr. Bernard does an excellent job. I hope is it distributed far and wide.Not to answer for the doctor, but who really trusts what ‘the government’ says about anything anymore?My question too! I look forward to the findings.Dr. Greger, while you’re at it, it would be of great value if you could comment to your NutritionFacts followers regarding the announcement today that the U.S. dietary recommendations no longer suggest limiting dietary cholesterol intake. What are we to think? What does the science say? You are the go-to man for guidance.Hmm, reminds me of that joke, how to you keep an @$$#Ø£€ in suspense? LOL! Can’t wait!!!Yet sulphur seems to be important…“In your body, MSM provides the mineral sulfur. You need sulfur to build skin, hair, cartilage, ligaments and tendons. The sulfur in MSM also helps heal and repair injured, overused or damaged joint tissues. And it relieves joint and muscle pain.In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 118 people with knee pain tried four different treatments. After 12 weeks, MSM decreased pain 52% compared with a placebo. And when it was combined with the amino sugar, glucosamine, it decreased pain by 79%.In another study, doctors gave patients with sports injuries either MSM or a placebo. MSM reduced symptoms by 58.3% compared with just 33.3% for the placebo. MSM also reduced the need for doctor visits by 40% and reduced disability time.You can get MSM naturally from foods, such as milk, eggs, meat and seafood. The best sources are sulfur-rich vegetables, like onions, garlic, asparagus, cabbage, broccoli and Brussels sprouts. But you probably won’t get enough from food. ” Al Sears, MDI already get 300 mg MSM from an arthritis supplement…and am considering taking more. Plus onions, garlic, asparagus, cabbage, broccoli…Excellent question Arjari! It is a shame when only one side of a story is reported just to support one’s position. ALL sources of COMPLETE protein have the the sulfur-containing aminos, not just animal. Found this while researching some of the “sources” used here. BTW-the last source from the journal GUT in 1997 had only 5 subjects. Accurate conclusions CANNOT be drawn from such a small sample size. Furthermore it appears that is certain members of the population have a genetic alteration makes them susceptible to this. Easy to Google. Please look at these lists of foods and recommendations: http://www.healingwell.com/community/default.aspx?f=38&m=1938770As far as i know they help to clean the body. But i just read that somewhere and can’t remember where.There is also another interesting factor in our diet which isn’t regularly eaten but contains sulfur – antibiotics. This kind of sulfur (i am not sure for the sulfur in meat and dairy) acts like a cement inside our “cell sewer” – lymph veins. This creates more blockages all over our bodies, leading to tissue degradation and all kinds of symptomes – dis-eases. High fruit diet and therapeutic fasting seem to deal with this problem very well.I hope the doctor will have more time to reasearch fasting.I so look forward to these videos every day… I learn so much here! Being a colitis sufferer myself, this was of particular interest to me. When my symptoms flair the drill is… boiled vegetables, fresh cabbage juice and a starch till it goes away. You da man Dr. G!Hilarious, you took the words right out of my mouth with the first sentence! I was just about to write a separate post and saw yours! LOL! Cool find on the cabbage juice!1.Just as omnivores consume too much methionine, do vegans consume too little? In that case, what if a vegan take a methionine supplement? (Methionine is an essential amino acid; we need to get it from external sources.) Would gut bacteria generate H2S from supplemental methionine in vegans? Or, is it like the case of choline? Do only the meat eaters harbor in their guts bacteria that can convert methionine into H2S?2. Bacteria lives in the colon. In a healthy gut, the material reaching the colon should not contain any proteins or free amino acids because the digestion and absorption should be complete by the time it reaches the colon. If this is true (This is just an argument; I don’t know if it’s true), then isn’t impaired digestion the root of the problem?Regarding methionine, it’s very easy to track your food intake and see if you are consuming enough. Cronometer.com is a useful tool to do such. I don’t track every day, but do spot checks from time to time to see micronutrient levels. Provided I have consumed enough calories that day, I have never consumed <100% of my rda for methionine or any other essential amino acid. In anyone consuming a typical well balanced wfpb diet and consuming enough calories, I don't think it would be mathematically possible to do so.But how does the body generate H2S in managing blood pressure and in immune signaling? How is that molecule controlled and disposed of in the vasculature?excellent question! Sadly, its my wrong area of science, so hopefully someone here can share some insight on that for us. :)When I switched from SAD to WFPB, it totally put my ulcerative colitis in remission. I’ve had no problems in 6 years. :-)Ditto for me and my IBS! You are right! It happened over time and I attributed it to a big weight loss, but DUH!!! No more locating the bathroom as a priority everywhere I go!My father-in-law (a big meat eater) has severe Crohn’s disease. My husband often intuitively attributes his own healthy digestion to being vegetarian (for the last 30 years since we met). I always thought he was giving his diet too much credit, but after watching this video, realize that he may be right. And to think all those years my in-laws have criticized me for being vegetarian!Julie: Over time, I went through a similar change in my thoughts. I started out believing phrases such as “everything in moderation”. I used to believe that people could eat any food category except for junk food and still have very healthy diets. By that reasoning, eating vegetarian or vegan would be strictly an ethical decision, not one about health.But over the last few years of nutrition study, including what I have learned here on NutritionFacts, I have come to see that there really is a huge health advantage to eating a whole plant food based diet – and that animal products are really not healthy. (Or put another way: that moderation when it comes to animal products means eating a very, very small amount. Way smaller than most people realize.) It is amazing how much credit we can give to healthy eating and being healthy. Yes, your in-laws have a lot to take back. ;-)It sounds like animal products harm our gut via the microbiome in a number of ways. From this video I learned that animal protein is broken down into toxic sulpher compounds by gut bacteria, and from The Digestion Summit I learned that saturated fat from animal products feeds and promotes unhealthy gut bacteria.As a mom with a daughter who was diagnosed at the age of 6 months with Crohn’s Disease who never even had anything other than breastmilk I struggle with the fact that you can “prevent” IBD. I would also add that I am a vegetarian and fully support a plant based diet. Also I am Registered Dietitian so my knowledge and personal interest in nutrition has always been important to me and based on science. I think you have to look a little further then eating animal protein to explain IBD. With the identification of more than 160 genes associated with IBD and specifically NOD2, science is showing more and more that there is a strong genetic component. I think you oversimplify this disease when you suggest that the only thing a person needs to do is not eat animal protein. I say this with all due respect to Dr. Greger, this is very distressing to read articles like this when you have children suffering from IBD and living with only half of their intestines or an ostomy and a very poor quality of life. It just is not that simple.Check out this new Scientific American article regarding IBD:http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/among-trillions-of-microbes-in-the-gut-a-few-are-special/Loren: What a fascinating read! I just skimmed that article, but it sure does stir the imagination. Thanks for sharing it.Great article. Thank you. CCFA is also doing some great research on their Microbiome Initiative. I believe they are entering into their last phase. Hopefully they will be able to shed more light on the altered interactions between gut microbes and the intestinal immune system.Sara, I completely agree with you, it’s not that simple. It’s painful as a parent with a child suffering from a chronic disease to hear all the supposed ways it can be prevented; I understand your feelings of resentment (my child is type 1 diabetic). Since there are so many factors that can cause a chronic disease, and those factors are usually unique for each individual and often unknown, we have to be careful taking an association in a study and pointing a finger telling someone “That’s what caused your condition”. I think the point Dr. Greger is trying to make is that ONE of the many factors that can be related to UC is meat consumption.Thank you. I’m sure you face many of the same situations I face as a parent. I don’t want to come off as negative or bitter but it is a very complicated disease. IBD is a debilitating disease, leaving you with a very poor quality of life.I agree, see my reply to Sara, above. (Below? Whichever!) Why are we, as parents always made to feel such a burden of guilt? Even if it did turn out there was a way to prevent X, how could we possibly have done it if NOBODY knew how! As a mom and now gramma myself, I know I would sooner take on their burdens than see them suffer, so the idea of letting harm come to them is insane. As a parent, you do your best…don’t take it to heart when doubt is cast in your direction! It’s always easy for others to stand in judgment and point fingers…it makes people feel like it’s your fault so it couldn’t possibly happen to them, ya know?Amen. Well said, Charzie.I totally understand your pain, there are so many issues here. I’m certainly no scientist, though I always had a yen to get into research, but I can definitely see how this disease can have a dietary component AND/OR a genetic one. The end result and maybe even some of the mechanisms in play are the same, but a different cause. If say, one was born with an inherited inability to process certain “compounds” …say in this case, methionine… they would develop symptoms similar to average folks taking in too many of these…or something along those lines. I hope you get my train of thought here. In essence, I think then that though the symptoms can be identical, work needs to be done to isolate and identify the genetic component for diagnostic purposes. Though in a case like your daughter, it seems obvious. I wonder though…you said you were vegetarian and your daughter had nothing but breast-milk? If you DO eat animal products, is there a possibility that with her inborn exquisite sensitivity to “whatever”, there was enough crossing over into your milk to set off a reaction in her tiny body? Sorry, I am not trying to pry, but after living with IBS most of my life, and being a mom and gramma, I empathize with both of you!I had not eaten animal products for probably close to 10 years. I’m not saying that there is not a nutritional component there I just don’t believe it is the cause of the disease . If what you are saying is that it is genetic but by eating animal protein it develops into IBD? That could possibly be one route to develop IBD. I do believe there is some connection between genetics and the micrbiome and nutrition does play a part in our gut.I think it can work both ways, either entirely genetic, or with the dietary factor. My point is, like you, I don’t think the cause is only dietary, and it would be important to make that distinction in cases like your daughter’s. I hope they get to the root of it so that she, and others like her, can have an improved quality of life. Best of luck!MAP. That’s now the number one suspect. The microbe can be picked even in the air in some rural areasAnd to clarify… the acronym, I assume, means?Mycobacterium paratuberculosisvery very hard to isolate for a diagnosis. current treatment also unsatisfactory. new tests and an actual vaccine is in the works for prevention and CURE http://crohnsmapvaccine.com/global-warming-mycobacterium-avium-subspecies-paratuberculosis/Thanks, very interesting.Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosishttp://crohnsmapvaccine.com/global-warming-mycobacterium-avium-subspecies-paratuberculosis/Hey Sara. Just out of curiosity you mentioned you are a vegetarian. Does that mean that you likely consume dairy products?No dairy, including cow’s milk, cheese and yogurtSo you are Vegan then not Vegetarian right?Hi Sara, I was wondering the same thing about this disease being preventable as I was just diagnosed with Crohn’s and Mild Colitis via a recent colonoscopy and endoscopy procedure. When I asked my G.I. doctor (who was rated BEST in my town) he said it was GENETIC. I asked him if I should strictly be on a plant based diet and he replied NO. His only dietary restrictions were to stay away from RAW vegetables and spicy or greasy foods. He said we want to blame ourselves for this condition but “most likely” it is all Genetics. My Grandmother and her 3 sisters have all had bowel issues and all of them have had intestines and parts of their stomachs removed. My last living Great Aunt has almost no large intestine left and her insides are held together with mesh- how she is still alive is beyond me. I am definitely going to do a Plant based diet from now on for many reasons, but hoping this helps with the inflammation issues especially. I have had stomach issues since I was a child and now I am 43. I am terrified of having a flair up because if it’s anything like the pain I experienced in the emergency room- no thanks! Sending healing thoughts for your daughter…and you!19 years ago I lost my colon. If I knew then what I know now, I would still have my colon. Stop eating animal products. I feel great now. I live partly raw and partly cooked, because of the climate here. Every day I getting stronger. It is important that you eat enough, you have to eat a lot to have enough energy. It may take some time for your body to accept to life from plants. Animal proteins and fats cause UC and Crohn’s.It’s not Genetics!!!!Thank you. The pain that people with IBD experience is excruciating , I wish you and your family healing thoughts as well. So often you see several people in a family with IBD. You have a 20 percent higher risk of developing the disease if you have a first degree relative with IBD. And it goes up from there based on how many people have it. This supports a genetic component. My daughter’s pediatrician is one of the leading GI doctors in the country and he too believes there is a genetic link. And in talking to others with IBD I have never come across anyone who doesn’t believe there is a genetic link ( and people are saying this is what their GI has told them). I think eliminating animal products can only help with the inflammation and also trying to include the anti-inflammatory spices in your diet could help. I truly wish you the best of luck, this is a painful and frightening disease.Since I have been diagnosed, I have told everyone in my family and it’s surprising to me how many of my family members also have it but never speak about it! When I was first having really bad pain, everyone wanted to diagnose me as Gall Bladder- the Dr. would push so hard in that area like they were trying to convince me it was that so they could do surgery. It was extremely frustrating. Thankfully an Emergency room Dr. sent me for a CT scan. I’m looking at anti-inflammatory everything right now!!I think you need to look a little further than genes to explain why IBD rates go up and down in populations over time. For the most part, we still aren’t in the position to prevent sensitive genes. Really it’s only the title that I think you may have an issue with, the video seems clear enough that this is only a partial explanation. In context, we know that Greger is specifically exploring nutritional causes, nutritional problems, and nutritional cures, and that there are therefore some topic areas which he won’t cover in detail.I’d be interested to hear feedback of macro nutrient ratio’s among nutritionfacts disqus readers. After shortly considering the rice diet for a while I settled on 15% fat 15% protein, staying below 15% fat is hard if you want to consume 20 gr walnuts and 20 gr flax. I haven’t noticed any negative effects of 15% protein in my bulk so I’m going to try 10 protein 15 fat (around 5-6 gr sat.) and 75 % carbs. What ratio did you settle on?Could it just be the antibiotics in the meat and not the protein?As the devils advocate, isn’t it possible to swallow a pill that binds to the sulfur and does away with all that negative effect?I wonder how hydrogen sulfide relates to indoles and skatoles?….Speaking of animal proteins…I can and should probably go study my biology, but I have a question for one of the resident geniuses that I’m sure is going to sound tremendously ignorant, but inquiring minds want to know. If allergic-type reactions are caused by our immune systems reacting to foreign proteins, and animals are especially foreign and yet confusingly similar, and it is known that the body secretes all kinds of protective factors to protect a potential fetus from being rejected, could all these things tie together to explain some of the issues that are involved with ingesting animals?Dr. Greger has suggested IGF-1, Insulin Growth Factor, a human growth factor that is made by the digestive system and precursor to insulin, as just such a particle. IGF-1 can leak out of your digestive system after any meal containing meat causing damage to not just the meat but also to you. It digests animal tissue. It can also clog receptors in the body making you less sensitive to insulin. The body makes more IGF-1 in response to diets rich in meat, and IGF-1 damage can build up as premature aging. It is not perfectly held by the digestive system and can leak out. IGF-1 spikes can also make people hungry, sometimes for more meat causing more damage. People who do not eat meat, for instance, the Lora Dunning Adventist Vegetarians, have been known to live 4-10 years longer than the general California population, perhaps because they have less IGF-1 damage in part. Stress can also create IGF-1. People who handle stress better can limit damage caused by IGF-1. Drinking ten daily cups of green tea can also add ten years to your life, as can swimming, going to Church, or being happily married. Eating nuts, whole grains, and exercise also can add years to life. What would the benefit of all these things be, including being a vegetarian? Could it be Fibonachi years based on your adherence? 1,1,2,3,5,8,13, or even 21 extra years? Some of the doctors whose research is presented here lived very long lives. I am hoping to read Dr. Greger’s forthcoming book on the subject.Well thank-you Matthew, you are a virtual encyclopedia of information! I’ve read that but didn’t make the connection!Search sialic acid and i think you’ll find his video on the tagging of epithelial proteins with a particular type of animal glcnac or some such that leads to a chronic low-grade inflammatory response. very interesting.I looked it up: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/Wow, I had never seen THAT video, that is fascinating! Going to look into it further, thanks so much. Heh heh, animals revenge.It may not be just the animal protein. In mice, high fat diets virtually eliminate gut barrier-protecting Bifidobacterium, while markedly increasing hydrogen sulfide and endotoxin producing Desulfovibrionaceae family 1. In another study, butter fat in amounts comparable to the Western diet provoked hepatic taurocholic acid synthesis, and this bile salt provided the substrate for hydrogen sulfide producing Bilophila wadsworthia 2. Ie, consume enough shorter chain C4-14 chain saturated fats found in dairy, and our own fat emulsifying compounds may provide the sulfur.Fellow flatologists will also note that hydrogen sulfide is one of the major malodorous compounds, so while a high fermentable oligosaccharide & fiber diet may increase volume, by beneficially modulating the microbiota it also dramatically reduces pungency.re: “Fellow flatologists will also note that hydrogen sulfide is one of the major malodorous compounds, so while a high fermentable oligosaccharide & fiber diet may increase volume, by beneficially modulating the microbiota it also dramatically reduces pungency.” OK, that was just fun to read. :-)there’s a geek band I’ve heard before, and some of their lyrics read like that. Wish I could remember the name of them.She blinded me with S-s-science!I’m sure you haven’t read the following locked article which reported a 55 yr old white male living with the principal investigator for 15 yrs demonstrated a marked reduction of H2S in flatulence, as measured by the PI’s own nose, after switching from a diet high in animal protein, to a diet high in plant protein (and no animal protein). Vegan R. Thank god his farts stopped asphyxiating me. Dear Diary. 2014:40:10-12.Great info Doc! Please keep reporting on these links to IBD! I lost my colon to Crohn’s Disease and if knowledge can prevent future generations from getting this horrible illness, I’ll spread the news far and wide!Hi all, I’ve just heard about the benefits of sulfur in crystallized form, (I use plenty of garlic but my friend swears by taking this product), can anyone help with any more info on this. Thank you in advance.I used to eat sulfur but it made my skin scaly.Do you mean MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane)?There’s been some recent studies showing it has some antioxidant effects and a lowing of inflammation. It’s promoted by the supplement companies as a way to help arthritis suffers. Seems more human studies are needed. It also looks like it has a positive effect on cancer cell apoptosis.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25461402 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25211405 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24523764 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575169another amazing video of course! interesting the connection between meat>sulfur>hydrogen sulfide>gut damage>and UC/chrons. but heck, i thought sulfur, especially the organic form, was great for us…you know those natural hot springs that have all kinds of magical healing properties..those reek of sulfur! i even take MSM and chondroitin suflate for joint health and immunity. theres got to be all kinds of organic sulfur tied up in the veggies bc good soil should have sulfur in it..so is the sulfur in meat somehow converted to Hydrogen sulfide but in veggies its not??? anyway, am interested in dr. g.’s perspective on dr. stephanie senuf, MIT researcher, who attributes most of modern diseases to sulfur deficiency…she has a very interesting take on cholesterol as well….thanks so much!http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/09/17/stephanie-seneff-on-sulfur.aspxVegans often add Nama Kalak or Black Sulfur Salt, (naturally found near hot springs), to tofu scrambles, vegan chickpea flour omelets, or any recipe that replaces eggs. Is adding sulfur to our vegan foods unhealthy?Dr. Greger, I have been studying the link between diet and inflammatory bowel disease for years, especially the link between diet and Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). To add to the evidence that high consumption of animal protein causes inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), check out these recent studies on how animal protein produces a bacteria that promotes inflammation in the bowels, potentially increasing the risk of IBD: http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/12/10/250007042/chowing-down-on-meat-and-dairy-alters-gut-bacteria-a-lot-and-quicklyScholary source: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v505/n7484/full/nature12820.htmlI’m sure these studies will help you produce another video on inflammatory bowel disease.As someone with Ulcerative Colitis, this theory of animal protein causing UC is not very substantiated in my own dietary experiences. At the beginning of 2013, I went on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet. The first few days was nothing but meat (I remember I did that for at least five days). After the die off phase (of bad fungus and bad bacteria), I had no issues. Once I started adding other foods back into my diet, then I started having issues again. Experimenting with my diet for over two years now, I have found plenty of non-meat foods that irritate my colon. Can eating too much meat cause issues? Yes, ass is eating or drinking too much of anything will.This short video did leave out questions about diet and the performed studies that are vital to understanding UC. First, and foremost, where can we obtain these studies? I am not out to discredit this perspective because of some bias against scientific studies. I have a bias in favor of scientific studies and am genuinely curious about their content. But, the video only skimmed the study and maybe only chose certain studies to fit the conclusions presented. What made up the rest of the diets of people eating meat? Did they include a variety of fruits and vegetables? What was the fat makeup of their diets? How was the meat prepared that the subjects ate (cooked all the way, with sauce, soaked in preservatives, breaded, lunchmeat)? Were any of the subjects tested for food allergies? Or the makeup of the organisms living in the subjects’ colon? Or genetic testing for breakdowns in the correct processes of the digestive system? What kind of stress were the different subjects exposed to?I can say that there are certain non-meat foods that aggravate my colitis. Foods that are considered some of the best foods to eat, such as carrots, tree nuts, sweet potato, apples (just a partial list I of what I cannot eat). The composition of my gut bacteria is not that of what you may find in an average sufferer of UC. I also have a couple of bad genes that cause issues with my body’s digestive processes. And during college and grad school, I used to go out binge drinking, and usually not on a full stomach. Could alcohol have played a role in my developing UC? (In my case, I’d say yes.)There is also a large community that believes large amounts of carbohydrates cause UC and (plain) meat is perfectly fine to eat. Did the studies being alluded to try to disprove the theory of carbohydrates causes UC? Did the video’s author compare the two theories? Do some people develop UC from meat and others from carbohydrates? Given the large number of people who eat meat and/or carbohydrates regularly, why is UC not more common than it is? I would conclude that genetics plays a large role in the development of UC (as numerous people in my family have digestive issues – mine is the worst, though).I am not a doctor. I am just a UC sufferer. And the questions I pose above are from my personal experiences and amateur level of research on the subject. However, I do believe the above questions (and of course countless other questions) are needed to be answered by anyone claiming they know the cause of US and how to decrease its intensity, or cure it (if you believe that is possible).Regarding sources: see “Sources” tab next to/below the video.A plant-based (vegan) diet will not “cure” inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rather it will help those with the disease achieve and maintain remission longer than those consuming an omnivorous diet; a few yet remarkable studies corroborate this (see Dr. Greger’s videos on Crohn’s disease, for example). IBD is a disease of severe inflammation (hence the name); therefore, because studies have conclusively proven that those on a plant-based diets have the lowest inflammation markers compared to those on omnivorous diets, it’s wise to stay away from animal products.You will always be genetically susceptible to relapse, especially if those with IBD continue consuming animal products. In addition to the studies that Dr. Greger provided for this video, numerous old and new studies have conclusively shown that a diet high in animal products (e.g. meat, dairy, and eggs) puts its consumers at a heightened risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Hence why Japan has seen an increase in inflammatory bowel disease since its adoption of the western diet – a diet high in animal fats and proteins. IBD in Japan was almost – if not completely – rare prior to the adoption of a western diet (again, see Dr. Greger’s sources for this video).Humans on an omnivorous diet have a bacterial flora vastly different from those on a plant-based diet. Unfortunately, the bacterial flora of those on an omnivorous diet have been proven to invoke inflammation throughout the body, including the bowels: http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/12/10/250007042/chowing-down-on-meat-and-dairy-alters-gut-bacteria-a-lot-and-quicklyThe bacteria flora of those on a plant-based diet, on the other hand, reduces inflammation. Hence more and more studies are proving that nasty bacteria that is produced from liver bile – which only occurs when you eat animal fats – causes inflammatory bowel disease, and this may be the reason why fecal matter transplants (FMTs) have been beneficial for those with IBD.If your colon is inflamed, it’s best to stay away from animal products and insoluble fiber. Consume soluble fiber (e.g bananas) and juice. In a last ditch effort to save your colon if diet and medication fails, consider smoking 4 cigarettes (an old medicine doctors use to prescribe for IBD) a day, because it will put you into remission: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2201475/Doctors-dont-know-best-Student-claims-cured-debilitating-bowel-disease-taking-smoking.htmlI’ve been researching IBD for years. Based on new findings, I believe researchers are very, very close to solving the underlying cause of IBD, potentially coming up with a cure and/or better treatments. Do whatever you can, therefore, to save your colon.My son has autism and and a fair amount of fowl smelling stools which we typically associate with a change in gut flora. In fact we sometimes do an extra probiotic when it occurs. The smell is typically acrid and ammonia in nature. Completely different animal than the rotten egg smell?Is this the same mechanism that contributes to carcinogenesis in colon cancer?It might. See page 7 of this review.Dear Dr. Gregor:I have just been diagnosed with IBD even though for the past 3-4 years, I eat 80% plant food – no eggs, or dairy. I do sometimes have fish or once in a while chicken. If fiber irritates my colon and I have been advised by my Kaiser doctor to avoid wheat and fiber, how does eating fiber then cure my condition.? Or maybe it is better to wait until I am better and then add fiber.Thanksvegans who opt to reduce ingestion of garlic, onions and cruciferous veggies might want to consider not taking their b12 in the form of cyanocobalamin since the body might require sulfur compounds to remove cyanide. the vegetarian hare krishnas don’t eat garlic or onion, believing they increase lustful desires.I noticed that you don’t have any videos discussing Candida Albicans overgrowth. Can you talk about that a bit? I’m doing my best to treat it with diet; avoiding sugars (alcohol, sweets, processed foods, easy starches and breads), and eating a lot of ginger, turmeric, coconut oil, yoghurt and fermented foods to try to get the good bacteria to fight of the bad yeast. Anything you can add? There is so much contradictory information out there.I don’t know if it’s my computer, but I cannot watch your videos without clicking on the “play” button every 2 seconds. The video keeps stopping. It happens every single time I watch a video here, and it doesn’t happen with any other video of any type anywhere else. It’s pretty annoying. Anyone has the same experience? I love Dr Greger’s videos, but cannot watch them properly.Dr. Greger –Do you use nutrition as a first line in your practice? Ive been having PVCs and 3 doctors have said they are harmless, but could start me on a beta blocker. None want to entertain a nutritional angle I wish it could be solved with food … One “doctor” (a chiropractor) said I should stop eating all grains & beans because they are anti-nutrient foods and I should be drinking bone broth daily.Joe, I’ve had the same problem for over 35 years, and though they are disturbing it is apparently a fairly common problem that may even have a genetic component, as both parents and my son also suffer from it. It’s maddening when it gets bad, and every third beat skips, and then “magically” can go away for short or long periods of time! I only wish I could help with the nutritional angle, nothing I’ve found specifically helps with any apparent regularity, but hopefully someone will figure it out! Sometimes foods high in magnesium seem to help, and it seems strongly associated with digestive issues in relation to the vagus nerve. A WFPB diet has been helpful for sure, but I still don’t have a solid idea of what triggers it! I would LOVE to hear some professional opinions because all I have ever gotten medically as you said was beta-blockers, which apparently are NOT all that effective for most people. I can’t even be clear on that, though I did cut way back on them, if I go below a certain dose, or skip one, the PVCs will always increase. They also keep migraines at bay, so getting off them has mixed blessings. I kind of wish I never started because I hate feeling like I rely on them, I’ve never been a fan of pharmaceuticals in general, but….tough call!Thanks Charzie – Which one are you one? I hear sometimes it takes a couple tries to find the one that has the least amount of side effects and Im starting to think this is my only path forward :( I think traditional medicine has tunnel vision to only stick with their ingrained tools they learn in med school, beta blockers, etc. Going with something else perhaps they feel vulnerable to lawsuits from negligence. I suppose that is what what a naturopathic doctor is for (have not seen one yet), but did see a nutritionist.Propanalol, generic Inderal. One of the few drugs that didn’t give me obvious side effects, though I hear some people say it makes them feel almost sedated, it never affected me that way. I am in total agreement with you on traditional medicine, and my being here is a “side effect” of being a former diabetic and relearning what I was mis-taught by the above! Good luck, I’d like to hear how it goes for you.joe: I think NutritionFacts does a pretty darn good job of proving just how grains and beans are incredibly healthy and full of good nutrients. I personally have a hard time taking advice from someone who clearly doesn’t know the science about something as basic as food.I can’t comment on your main question. But I do think you might see if you can find a good lifestyle medicine doctor in your area? One who understand what nutrition can and can not do for your problem?Good luck.A provocative paper just published in Nature: Chassaing et al. Dietary emulsifiers impact the mouse gut microbiota promoting colitis and metabolic syndromeCarboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80 are commonly used in ice cream, processed cheese, gluten free baked goods, and reduced fat processed foods,Darryl: This is interesting to me. But I don’t know what Carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80 are. You mentioned gluten free baked goods, which made me think of xantham gum, which I used in other types of recipes. Is xantham gum the common name for Carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80? Or are these completely different things?Thanks, – JJEmulsifiers are detergent-like compounds that coat fat globules and allow them to coexist with water in processed foods, without separating out. Dozens are approved additives.Xanthan gum is a thickening agent like corn starch – it provides a network of long molecules that increases the viscosity of liquids. There’s some evidence that its a prebiotic selectively feeding friendly bacteria, but I learned to my dismay that nearly all is produced by fermentation on whey – its generally not vegan.Darryl: Thanks for this explanation!That news about xanthan gum is very disheartening. Much dismay happening here too.So would xanthan gum that’s fermented on whey pick up any of the biological properties of the whey?Darrly, I am not certain Xanthan gum is not vegan. It seems to be produced from corn/fermented sugar. http://www.vrg.org/ingredients/index.phpNeed the fruits & vegetables lists to reverse someone’s liver cancer (stage 4) I want to help a sibling..thank you!Hello. Not sure what fruits and vegetables list you are referring to, but here is all of Dr. Greger’s videos aboutliver cancer. I am so sorry to hear about your sibling.Warm thoughts, JosephDr Greger: what do you think of recent research out of Georgia State University showing that polysorbate 80 (P80) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) eroded mucus membranes in the gut? I realize the study was done in mice, but do you think it advisable for people with UC, Crohn’s, or a family history of IBD to avoid these emulsifiers?Sure. You can always avoid additives and it’s probably a really good idea! The only thing is research conducted on animal models cannot translate into humans. I suggest avoiding the stuff and see if flares are reduced. Again, avoiding any type of food additive is advisable, if possible.","['animal protein', 'bile acids', 'butyrate', 'colon health', ""Crohn's disease"", 'DNA damage', 'fecal bacteria', 'fiber', 'flatulence', 'gut flora', 'hydrogen sulfide', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'intestinal health', 'Japan', 'meat', 'plant protein', 'plant-based diets', 'steak', 'sulfur', 'ulcerative colitis', 'vegans', 'vegetarians']",The toxic rotten egg gas hydrogen sulfide may explain why animal protein is associated with inflammatory bowel disease.,"For the other major inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn’s, I’ve got Dietary Treatment of Crohn’s Disease and Preventing Crohn’s Disease With Diet.There is so much new amazing science about our microbiome I’ve got another dozen or so videos queued up on the subject—stay tuned!",-,-,"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fecal-bacteria/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/GMO/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colon-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dna-damage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/intestinal-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/steak/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sulfur/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/paleolithic-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bile-acids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/flatulence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetarians/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/japan/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gut-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hydrogen-sulfide/","http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-crohns-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17475672,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10590225,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18043233,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11101476,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22055893,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20461067,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24913390,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8615358,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10198924,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9274475,"

He actually says he’s known that diet can cure his health problems for a long time. Then he adds, “Change my diet? Never!” Well, I’m going to do everything in my power to live out my days as painless and healthy as possible eating wholesome plants. Nothing tastes as good as being fit feels.I feel your pain – it’s like trying to herd cats….At least you can take some comfort from knowing that your father has made his own choice, whereas my neighbour takes his Dr’s word as gospel and refuses to accept any other opinion, as do so many others of his generation…….All we can do is keep trying……Yeah, trying to help others with this info can be so frustrating! My mom wants to believe that the meds she and my dad take are helping them. It upsets her world too much to even consider that her doctor is doing a disservice by not informing them that diet can be way more helpful and medication more toxic than they’ve been led to believe. She told me that she’d respect Dr. Greger more if he offered a broader picture, stating both the pros and the cons. Aargh!Wow. You cannot get more PRO/CON than this video.Yes, some people will accept the conclusions, others will not – and there are people like your parents that require additional proof in many different formats – c’est la vie….Thinking takes energy. And thinking against your beliefs takes tones of energy. Associating the food with love makes it even harder.Coincidentally, love does have something to do with it – he’s a comfort eater, he loves his wife but she hates him (long story).He is the definitive example of a person displaying akrasiac behaviour – smoking, drinking, comfort eating (all the wrong processed foods – are there any right ones?), refuses to exercise, just sits on the sofa watching TV all day – and his cancer has metastasized to the bones…..I hope that I never find myself in a similar situation.I’d say loving wrong things and the lack of love (from others) are two great reasons why someone will never change. My dad knew about healing power of vegan, raw vegan food and fasting long before his gallbladder was taken out and long before he got colon cancer.No love = no motivation = no change. I too hope i will not end like this. Suffering and felling sorry for myself. In fact i will do more than just hope. I will do anything in my power to make myself and the world better.I share your enthusiasm for the future – I have told my neighbour that I will do my utmost to avoid finding myself in his position. To his credit he agrees, and says that if he had his time over again he wouldn’t make the same mistakes (we all must say this at some point in our lives), but now he feels he is too old for a lifestyle change. I don’t agree with this choice, you hear this type of comment all the time, and I interpret it as “I’m too lazy to change”, as there are a number of videos on NF that tell you it’s never too late, but then again I’m a few decades away from my 70’s, who knows whether I’ll live that long, and if I do, whether I become his clone……..You are your own creator ;) And you can’t change others. Maybe you can pinch someone … but still they have to become aware themselves.My grandfather was the same way. He refused to try anything new, even though he eventually came to admit that the statins weren’t actually helping. There isn’t much to do if the person in question isn’t willing to help themselves. It certainly reinforced my thoughts on the whole foods I eat everyday, however!It’s tough.It is pretty clear to me that a whole food plant based diet is great.But go back to when you weren’t vegan. You probably would be pretty uncomfortable with someone else trying to shit on your lifestyle. Maybe you would have a defensive reaction.It is important to remember that we as human beings don’t know reality, we just make “mental models’ for what reality can be. Your neighbor had probably lived his whole life having risky habits reinforced. You can expect a defensive reaction if you state something that challenges someone’s mental models.I am studying medicine and I am struggling with motivational interviewing… And when to wear the doctor hat and when to just listen.Encouraging change without eliciting defensive reactions is an art I hope to learn. Thanks for posting about motivational interviewing (just looked it up) as I’ve not yet studied these techniques. Good luck in your studies.Well I don’t have to go back far, and when I think about it, if I hadn’t stumbled across a comment on a bodybuilding forum re protein intake and “The China Study”, I would still be eating about 150-200gms of animal protein per day – maybe you can provide me with some motivational techniques for my neighbour – any involving chocolate, dairy, meat and lack of exercise should work……I hope you are spreading the NF word among your fellow students – reading what some of the other medical practitioners have written, I believe I’ve had more Health and Safety training on how to lift a box correctly, than you medical students have re nutrution – good luck with your studies.I would still consider myself mediocre at motivational interviewing.There are some videos on YouTube about it.But you could check out “the fifth discipline” by Peter Senge. I think it provides a philosophical framework for leveraging positive change.Thanks, I will take a look…..For prostate cancer, this site recommends fenugreek, amla. strawberry. black raspberry, mushrooms. seaweed. flaxseed. matcha. walnuts. pecans, cranberry, lemonade, apples. rosemary, tumeric with pepper. ginger, garlic, cloves, beets. spinach. collards. broccoli, kale. chamolle. dandelion. hibiscus. Nuts, beans, matcha, cocoa, Whole grains, berries, fresh fruit, fresh veggies, and spices are recommended. I think when presented with data on how effective fenugreek, amla, and other advice from this site are on a long term battle with prostate cancer, you could be a real game changer.Although your list sounds daunting, it is amazing how many of those things are incorporated in Ayurvedic medicine. eg. a single product called Hingvastak contains:cumin, ajamoda, black cumin seed, black pepper, ginger, pippali (another type of pepper), asafoetida, and fenugreek. I dump it on my food and it is absolutely delicious. I also turn my green tea into super tea by adding Tulsi powder, another Ayervedic herb with extensive scientific evidence supporting it.I know…I am trying to get my GP to NOT prescribe drugs to my hubby. He has gone 90% vegetarian…he struggles some days, but his blood sugar is coming down and his weight is coming down…but they still want him to take statins and bloodpressure meds. Le sigh. If I tell him not to take them, my doctor thinks I am nuts.Try expanding your Dr’s nutrution knowledge by pointing him in the direction of NF – you could always consider changing your Dr (extreme – but if you feel so strongly about it, this it may be your only option).Good Luck…For hypertension, this site recommends beets, hibiscus tea, seaweed, grapefruit, beans, brazil nuts, whole grains, and flax seed meal. For high cholesterol, this site recommends nuts (particularly almonds), whole grains (like Cheerios), flax seed meal, kiwi, grapefruit, red yeast rice, dried apples, amla, and beans like chickpeas. For high blood sugar this site recommends hibiscus tea, cinnamon, flax seed meal, amla, and beans. Thule has produced another list of recommendations from this site for high blood sugar: Indian gooseberries (amla), coffee, soy, flaxseeds, green tea, pulses (dried beans), chamomile tea, purple potatoes, sprouts, whole grains, vinegar, and beans. Congratulations on your decision to be a vegetarian couple. One of the biggest sources of high blood pressure and rapid pulse is caffeine in the diet. You should be really prepared for heart disease. Dr. Greger in this site shows and states that lifestyle intervention should be front line or a main treatment and intervention for diseases that involve accumulated wear and tear on the bodies cellular machinery like heart disease. Intervention should be in one to two months, one year for full effect, based on Dr. Ornish’s results. Good luck to you and your family. In another video, Dr. Greger said that these medications have a low chance of working, below placebo effect, and have risk of side effects that could further hurt health. Lifestyle intervention is safe whether or not it works for you and you have already taken positive steps with it for health!Andrea…I had a similar thing happen to me as a Type 2 diabetic. However, there was a point where it became dangerous to KEEP taking meds because my blood sugar got too low. My doctor was amazed and took me off. Since then, I found a doctor here in Dallas that PROMOTES whole foods plant-based eating instead of meds. The Happy Herbivore has a list of doctors who support this way of eating. You might want to check it out! http://happyherbivore.com/2014/09/plant-based-vegan-doctors-list/Hi Andrea. Your concern is so valid. When you see the facts as they are outlined above by Dr. Greger it is very hard to not want to throw the pills in the garbage can. It has been said that young doctors entering medical school want to take care of the “whole” patient but by the time they graduate medical school they want to only focus on the “hole” that’s in the patient, meaning that the practice of medicine is so narrowly focused and “super subspecialized” that we’ve lost the forrest for the trees. And as we can see – we’re not doing a very good job at focusing on the “hole”. It’s going to take a movement (that we are in the midst of) and patients like yourselves asking questions over and over again combined with doctors who really want to treat the patient and not the symptom. I certainly have hope. What about vitamins to replace plants? ……you might ask. Take a look at these studies reviewed by Dr. Greger a few years ago Produce Not Pills to Increase Physical Attractiveness There are certainly exceptions to every rule……..Vitamin Supplements Worth TakingI see this reaction often! I think much of it stems from fear: fear of change, regret that we may have been doing it wrong all this time, fear of the unknown diet we are afraid we could not comply with. Having our lifetime personal beliefs challenged can be difficult to handle for some individuals. The truth sometimes hurts but we need to push thru all that.almost everybody I know thinks like that. However I see many young people have switched to a plant based no oil diet. I think the old generation must die off before something new will start. Question is: will the biosphere survive long enough?Why is it that that Dr Greger neglects to mention that in the trial he refers to 5 patients on the vegan diet died of non cardiac events while none of the standard diet patients died of non cardiac events – an important caveat even if many more patients were in the vegan group. Why is death ignored????Hi Herb,I believe you are misreading the publication. There were two groups, 177 that followed the vegan diet and 21 who did not. Of the ones following the vegan diet, 81% improved, 8% remained the same and 10% got worse. 5 of them (3%) died indeed, but not due to cardiac events (3 cancer-related deaths, 1 fatal pulmonary embolism, and 1 case of pneumonia). Of those who didn’t follow the diet and only took medication, 0% improved, 38% remained stable and 62% got worse. 2 of them (9.5%) died due to cardiac events.It’s all detailed in Table 2 of the manuscript: http://dresselstyn.com/JFP_06307_Article1.pdfYou can play with the numbers all you want, but the picture is very clear. Much more so than with any other study involving medications. The only thing missing here is a study with much larger numbers to make the statistics more convincing (with the authors themselves suggest).Regards,FlorenBattle of the critics, and…….. truth wins!!!Welcome aboard FlorenIt may or may be statistically significant, as you yourself point out by your use of the word ‘probably’.My point which seems to be studiously avoided by all commenters it that the 5 deaths vs zero should have been disclosed in the video. Particularly since there are a number of trials that show a high all cause mortality associated with a significant reduction in cholesterol, which a vegan diet certainly results in.You’re not being honest about the stats here. All cause mortality was 5 to 2, not 5 to zero. It’ll take a larger randomized controlled study to determine if your cholesterol “deficiency” hypothesis is has any validity.You’re correct -non cardiac mortality is 5 to 0. All cause is 5 to 2. I meant to say non cardiac instead of all cause as I correctly stated in other comments.Which trials?What I tend to note is that the major meta-analyses to date indicate no serious risk of excess non-CVD mortality from statins:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23440795 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25579834Given that Greger was principally comparing different treatments in terms of benefits to CVD and did not take care to specifically mention any non-CVD mortality in any of the drug studies he cites, I don’t really see what has you in knots about this one omission versus all the others.“It may or may be statistically significant, as you yourself point out by your use of the word ‘probably’.”‘Approximately’ is perhaps a better adverb for what Arjan is doing, because that comparison is grounded in a relatively standard statistical test. 5/8.4 is the expected number of non-CVD deaths for the non-adherent group if as a null hypothesis, you assume they have the same non-CVD mortality estimated for the adherent group. However, 5/8.4 is substantially less than 1, meaning that there must be a substantial probability of getting 0, meaning we fail to reject the null.More formally, if the expected number of deaths under the null hypothesis is 1-x and the probability of zero deaths is p, then 1-x >= 1-p. So in this case x is 0.40476 and p > 40%, and is thus clearly not significant at the 95% confidence level.I’m not playing with numbers. 5 people on the vegan diet died of non cardiac causes and none of the others. That’s a fact which you acknowledge. I am not questioning that the vegan diet was much better at preventing cardiac events. What most people also want to know is whether their overall chance of death is better or worse on a particular diet. By omitting the fact that 5 vs 0 people died of non cardiac causes on the vegan diet, he is omitting a very material fact. One can have a reasonable debate about whether a vegan diet leads to more cancer, embolisms, pneumonia etc, but one can’t have have that discussion if the facts are not revealed can we?“What most people also want to know is whether their overall chance of death is better or worse on a particular diet.” With all due respect Herb, every last one one of us, regardless of diet, has an infallible 100% chance of death.Your comment takes the grand prize for a non sequitur. I appears that you can provide no substantive rebuttal to my comment. The logical result of your comment would be – Why bother doing any trial if we all have a 100% chance of death? Thus this – and every health – site might as well shut down. Is that what you’re suggesting?It seems what you meant to say is “What most people also want to know is whether their overall chance of death in a specific manner is increased or decreased on a particular diet”. My reply was fair based on what you wrote.Today’s video addresses the conflict doctors face prescribing medications with efficacy rates that could be significantly bested if our treatment paradigm was to encourage and support lifestyle change when a patient is a candidate for Rx treatment. The study of 198 people that you’re referencing focuses on already very sick people with CVD who’ve agreed to change their diets from omnivorous to plant-based with the support of intensive nutritional counseling – and for which there were significant positive results for those adhering to the new diet.Yes, there were people in both groups who died (5 in the adhering group from three different manners of death and 2 in non-adhering from similar manner of death). And yes, of course, the question can be asked, did adherence to the new diet contribute to the three other manners of death in that group? Or did non-adherence contribute to that cause of death? We can also ask, would these patients have died from those same non-CVD events, or even CVD events regardless? Would it have been sooner? But, that’s all we can do is ask questions so it’s not that as you said, “death is ignored”….but in the context of this video, highlighting the outliers of the study doesn’t add one way or the other to the point of the video.There are studies showing that at least 70% of us will die at some point in our lifetimes.It was a royal use of the pronoun “you”, I was not accusing you personally of playing with the numbers. My apologies for the lack of clarity.I will insist that the really important numbers are how many people improve/don’t get worse with the vegan diet+drugs vs the drugs-only group. Those numbers are incredibly clear. But if you want to focus on deaths this is what I see:– 5 people died out of 177 with a vegan diet+drugs –> 2.8%. NONE of them for cardiac events.– 2 people died out of 21 with only drugs –> 9.5%. All of them for cardiac events.As a percentage, more people die when they take only the drugs. To be honest, with a population of only 21 individuals the 9.5% percentage is pretty meaningless to me. But it is significant to me that out of 177 patients with a vegan diet, in several years, NONE died of a cardiac event.As I see it, people dying for causes other than cardiac events is not relevant to this study. If there had been 20 people dying of say, liver cancer, I would be worried about the effects of the vegan diet. But they didn’t, so I won’tWe can discuss to the end of days about what is relevant/material and what is not, but I guess it is a subjective matter. For me it is pretty clear that those deaths were unrelated to the study and therefore I would also leave it out of a 4 minutes video that discusses many other things. If someone is really interested in the details, he/she can look at the paper, which is cited in the video.If you wanted to have a discussion about the effects of diet on some other disease, then you should look at a study looking at that particular disease.Regards,FlorenFloren,You’re concluding that the other deaths were not related to a vegan diet. I’m saying you can’t a priori assume that and thus the numbers should have been disclosed, particularly given the many studies that show cholesterol lowering drugs (which I know is not the same as a vegan diet) often lead to higher non cardiac deaths. I would feel much better if the Dr had disclosed the excess deaths and attempted to explain why they should be disregarded. I guess at this point we’ll have to agree to disagree but I certainly respect your viewpoint.Herb,You are right, no one can positively conclude those deaths are unrelated to the diet. But you do not have not enough data pointing in that direction in this study either. If you take 177 people with cardio vascular disease (CVD) with a mean age of 63+/-10 years, after 3.7+/-2 years (these are the numbers from the study)it is perfectly within expectations that 5 of them will die of a number causes.So, I cannot say with absolute certainty that those deaths are unrelated to diet, but I can say with great confidence that statistically speaking there is nothing suspicious in those 5 deaths and that the only observation with any statistical significance (and a great one for that matter) is the fact that nobody died of a cardiac event in a group of 177 people that were already sick at the beginning of the study.I still think that since the video was about the low efficiency of drugs, looking at the nitty-gritty details of 5 deaths with no statistical significance in a study that is mentioned as an counter-example, is really going to far.As you say, I will agree to disagree :)Have a great afternoon Herb.FlorenHerb, Do you honestly expect no deaths from people who are this seriously ill? I don’t think anyone who reads studies (testing vegan diet or not) with this population would even assume there were no deaths. I don’t imagine a layperson would either.The issue isn’t that people died. The issue is deaths in each group. I don’t think most people would expect 5 vegan deaths vs 0 non vegan deaths (non cardiac). As I’ve written above I believe it should have been disclosed and discussed. That’s the only point I’ve been making.Surely, you’ve met people in your life who have had 5 more people die in their lives than yours. Is this statistically significant to draw some conclusion that that person may be the cause of death? Or how about that thing called chance? Now, if it was 50 in 2000, 500 in 20000, etc then it would warrant consideration. Much ado about nothing. Run a larger study (or fund it) and then we can move the conversation in a serious direction.Hey Herb,I think it is good that you pointed out a possible neglection of information here. Always need to question what people tell you. Anyway – on the matter I do agree with Floren and others. You can’t really compare the total numbers of 5 vs 0 for two reasons. First -> there were a lot more vegans in this study – so if the mortality rate would be the same it would need ~0.5 deaths in the non-vegan group (which is not far off from 0 actually. Second -> You can’t really discard the two cardiac deaths either, since they couldn’t die of any other cause since heart attack had them first, eventhough they might have been stage 4 cancer patients or something else.In my opinion stating the fact of 5 deaths vs 0 deaths in non cardiac deaths for vegan vs non-vegan seems to be more misleading than saying nothing at all, considering the above. No offense.Great answer Floren!Herb… 177 were those that followed the vegan diet and 21 who did not. More people equals more possibility of deaths…what’s not to understand? If those following the non vegan died would have been 177, the deaths (in proportion) would have been 16!!!You know, I had no idea that drugs were that ineffective! My husband and I haven’t taken any medications for 30 years, and we know that healthy lifestyle come first. It’s obvious that medications have some nasty side effects, however I never imagined the effectiveness rate could be as low as 3%! And you know those effectiveness rates are usually from the drug company’s own research, which means that’s a generous 3% (aka possibly 0%).That 3% can be misleading. Let’s say 6% of people in the trial who take the placebo get the disease without treatment. If 3% of the trial participants get the disease there is an absolute risk reduction of 3% (6-3%). Yet the relative risk reduction is 50% (half of the 6% who were expected to get the disease did not get it). Drug companies almost always publicize the 50% number rather than the 3% number for obvious reasons. Both numbers are important however to inform one as to what to expect from taking a drug.Good point. Worth keeping in mind, though, that in this video Dr Greger is comparing high risk patients (who have a 5 % reduction in absolute risk taking pills) but a 60% chance of major cardiac event (using Esselstyn’s group of high risk patients). So the relative risk reduction of the pills would still only be about 10%. Correct me if I’m wrong.All of Esselstyn’s patients in his 15 year study took statins!Yes, but so did the control group. Diet made all the difference:“Major cardiac events judged to be recurrent disease totaled one stroke in the adherent cardiovascular participants—a recurrent event rate of .6%, significantly less than reported by other studies of plant-based nutrition therapy. Thirteen of 21 (62%) nonadherent participants experienced adverse events.”“There are lies, damned lies, and statistics”, but any doctor should be capable of clearly explaining to you what your expectations should be when taking a drug prescribed by her/him. It’s their job to give us the pertinent information and ours to make a decision.Then Tom ran into Huck. Huck was carrying a dead cat. (Not at good sign) What are you gonna do with the cat? Gonna cure ma warts. – Yr a hoot :)Dr. G., I was hoping you’d stress (more) the dangerous side effects from those horrible drugs you mentioned in the article (Fosamax, etc.). When I was a kid, I used to hallucinate from swallowing even a spoonful of cough medicine, Some people are highly sensitive to medications, and I think I’m one of them. Therefore, I try to live in such a way that I’ll never have to be prescribed any. Avoiding doctors is one of the ways. :-)“With record numbers of patients suffering or dying as a result of prescription drug side effects, many wonder why medications that are considered dangerous are allowed on the market. The truth is that nearly all medications, both over-the-counter and prescription, have some kind of undesirable and sometimes dangerous aftereffects, from muscle aches to death.”http://www.drugwatch.com/side-effects/Dr. Greger has addressed this issue in other videos, including his year in review videos.I’m a 72 year old female with a blood pressure that runs in the 130-145 systolic with a diastolic usually in the 80s and have been on 2 blood pressure medications for probably 15 years. My cholesterol is around 200 but I do not take statins. I’ve been a vegetarian for 47 years, a vegan for about 8 years and the last 3 1/2 years have not been using added fats or oils . I do eat nuts, avocados and olives in moderation. I limit my salt intake as well. Do you have any suggestions to bring both my cholesterol and B/P down?May I suggest at least walking around the block once a day but as much exercise as you can reasonable tolerate. Another physician wrote a book called How to grow younger as you grow older as I remember. Also do not smoke.You need to work with your physician(s) to decide what is best for you. You need to balance the risks of the drugs with the benefits. If you have been on two BP medications and have changed your diet it is reasonable to revisit the need for your medication. First step is to understand what your goal for BP should be. At your age your BP results would be considered acceptable by all current guidelines. You might be a good candidate for a trial off going off done of your medications. A home BP monitoring kit will help you and your physician test this out. I would suggest that you read Dr. John McDougall’s article, “How I treat patients with elevated blood pressure” in his November 2009 newsletter… go to his website. He has the most experience and understanding of the clinical literature that I am aware of. He is very good at avoiding over diagnosing and treating patients as well as the most appropriate medications. Good luck.Already tried high carb low fat raw vegan? which mean based on fruits if you want calories and easy digestion~Have you watched Dr. Greger’s videos on amla?For blood pressure, this site recommends beets, hibiscus tea, seaweed, grapefruit, beans, brazil nuts, whole grains, vegan diet, and flax seed meal. For high LDL, this site would recommend: nuts (particularly almonds), whole grains (like Cheerioes or oatmeal), flax seed meal, kiwi, grapefruit, red yeast rice, dried apples, amla, and beans like chickpeas.Take a closer look at your vegan diet – if you are eating any foods made from flour (bread, pasta, crackers, etc.), then eliminate them completely and only eat whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, buckwheat, millet). Also, you may not be getting enough greens. Blend yourself a greens smoothie daily. My recipe: 2 handfuls of fresh greens (kale, arugula, or spinach), 1-2 fresh fruits (usually 1 banana or 1 apple with core removed or 1 cup berries), 1-2 medjool dates with pits removed, juice of 1/2 lemon, about 1.5 – 2 cups water. Blend well and enjoy – it’s really very tasty and easy to digest. Exercise, usually a 15-30 minute daily walk will work in addition to your regular activities. I also suggest that you look at taking a probiotic supplement at least 3x/week. There has been research showing that gut flora may be an important factor in hypertension: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/279909.phpUnrelated, anything on puerh tea? Curious to know which of its many claims are substantiated.As I sit here in my office enjoying my lunch of carrots, celery, apples, hummus and nuts I am reading the chart of a patient admitted yesterday for depression. 52 y/o woman, BMI 34. Here is her list of home medications: colace, Reglan, Ditropan, Inderal, Protonix, Neurontin, Compazine, Zoloft, Seroquel XR, lorazepam, Lipitor, Dilaudid, Antivert, aspirin, Evista, and, finally, Zofran. Oh, and she said she was having a migraine during our interview and requested a shot of Imitrex. Lest one might think she is an outlier, I can assure you that this is not an atypical patient. I’ve discussed lifestyle changes with her in the past. She prefers pills, especially when someone else, ie. the taxpayer, is footing the bill.She most certainly could benefit from a lifestyle change, but I don’t know that it’s realistic for a person in the grips of depression to take on the taxing task of changing their diet. I have suffered from chronic depression since I was a child, and before the last time it got bad, I was doing really well losing weight and eating healthy. But it’s a lot of effort to avoid the things I want to eat, and when I really don’t care whether or not I wake up in the morning, I’m certainly not going to choose the long-term benefit of a salad over the immediate benefit of a box of cookies.But you do have her admitted…. so… she eats what you give her or she doesn’t eat? :)I learned long ago that there is little to be gained by forcing a diet for a few days in the hospital on someone with a lifelong history of unhealthy eating. I do draw the line when 300 pounders demand double portions. Our hospital actually does offer healthy alternatives, at least for snacks. That is where I get my supply of veggies and hummus.2 years the clip is on youtube and within 18 hours after my attack its gone for copy right reasons. Hit a nerve hard huh? You must have a very low opinion of everybody here indeed if you think them incapable of seeing right through that move. I’m done here, what a joke.Sorry. I confused your name with Ariel.Some people are unwilling to give up the unhealthy lifestyle because this is who they are. This is the life that they are uncomfortably comfortable in. “Who would I be if I weren’t this sick person seeking medical attention?” “This is the way I was brought up.” And they won’t break out.Adrian, In my opinion you are way out of line.Arjan, In my opinion you are way out of line. Sorry for getting your name wrong.I am out of line, and I’m sorry if I caused you upset. But this person Psych MD is a charlatan, who asserts himself as a person of importance and station, while he is not. Talks the talk of caregiver but has repeatedly shown disdain to lesser beings, this is not a good person.Arjan, Thank you. We all have regrettable ” moments”.She prefers pills, especially when someone else, ie. the taxpayer, is footing the bill.NOT the first time I noticed something weird about you, maybe you should put some effort into finding a different occupation. This one is clearly not one that comes natural to you, the role of care giver I mean.Arjan, That is an extremely aggressive reaction!Yes it is, but I suspect this person doesn’t just study nutrition facts here, I think decent people mannerisms have his interest too, to better mimic.In light of your previous tirade, “exposing” Dr. Greger for what he really is, I consider myself in good company.That was not exposing for what he really is, I pointed out inconsistencies that could cause harm to either people or his reputation. And as person of good character he pointed out that any help toward maintaining quality control was most welcome, and offered his email to all to do just that. You are quite delusional if you think yourself of anywhere near similar caliber.Dear Arjan, in the recent study about antidepressants, they found people who take them are more likely to attempt to kill themselves with an antidepressant overdose than people who are not on antidepressants. They dressed this up to say people who do not take antidepressants are not likely to kill themselves and that antidepressants save lives. We are pretty sure antidepressants cause anxiety and depression and cause suicide attempts. These are very powerful and very dangerous pills. Almost all of them cause a loss of libido, weight gain, and impair some type of brain function. Many people who come to this site believe that the vegan diet can, at least biochemically cause happiness in the mentally ill. These are people who are told they will not be in control of their minds for the rest of their lives and will have to always be on these medicines for ever. The people who take them know there are terrible debilitating humiliating side effects and that the pills don’t work very well. I was happy to run into this report, vitamin B3 and Vitamin C for the treatment of mental illness, as a counter point. http://www.altmedrev.com/publications/13/4/287.pdf by Dr. Hoffra.There are two schools of thought. the old school who are products of their parents and social environment and the New school, willing to break free learn why we are sick and do something to change their life. The best advise is don’t waste your time and choose to not own the outcome from people who are not interested in getting well. Let them experience their life the way they chose to learn from it to grow their spirit and soul whether its healthy or not. To own their misery is just an negative energy drain on you. Concentrate your efforts on your own health, wealth and wisdom and share only when others ask for it. Tell them….”don’t ever eat anything green, you might get well.”Great video. I wrote a blog post on Supplements a couple weeks back. http://cleanfooddirtygirl.com/why-you-dont-need-vitamin-supplements/I was tod by drs maybe 6 yrs ago i had to start taking pharmaceuticals for extremely high bood pressure n cholesterol, or i would die.changed my diet instead to whole foods,now they say i have blood pressure of a teenager. I feel 20 yrs younger,actually went 100%vegan about a yr ago.i am 58.friends n family tell me how awesome it is n I’m the healthiest person they know but they continue their lifestyle of destruction. Never will understand the logic.Congratulations Jimmie on how you’ve taken control and turned your health around over the past six years. It is a huge accomplishment, and a path that few are willing to take even if gravely ill. I think that the lifestyle of destruction you’ve mentioned is because most people are addicted to their high fat, high sugar, and high processed foods diet. There is research showing how processed junk foods light up the same areas of the brain as heroin: http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/2010/20100329.htmlThe age of convenience we live in, at least in the West, is a blessing and a curse.There is an interesting website on evidence-based medicine based on a concept of “Number-Needed-to-Treat” for one person to benefit from a treatment and with reviews of quite a few different treatments: http://www.thennt.com/thennt-explained/When I was diagnosed with heart disease ,I was already organic vegan that did not stop my heart attack and being stented in one artery and found out the other three artery’s were at 90 , that was two years ago ,unfortunate for me my dad died from high cholestrol at 49 yrs when I was 13 ,I had my heart attack at 51 yrs I did not want to take statins I had no choice because my body produces high cholestrol ,and since that drama I now have other health issues ,so I never eat meat I am vegan and still in for more stenting .Comparing trials is possible (=meaningful) only if they are comparable. A single trial w/ no control group nor other interventions, based on an already very selected & motivated individuals vs a large amount of large, comparative trials (comparing the efficacy of statins against best known treatment) … There is no meaningful comparison here.Esselstyn’s diet may be more effective than current treatment options. Or it may not be. This cannot, however, be shown without a PROPER trial. Greger’s video is – simply put – useless.What happened to the video? All Black!Never mind, I needed to update on my computer..oops!Can anyone please tell me exactly just how is plant-based diet is better? Every time I want to be a vegan, people around me always say that ‘plants’ (vegetables and fruits) are GM foods, are using lots of pesticides, chemical fertilizers, etc. Now I don’t really know what to eat. Thanks in advance!Commoner: Your confusion is understandable. First, please note that there are only 9 legally authorized/commercially available GMO plant foods in America. So, your friends’ idea that vegetables and fruits are GMO foods in general is simply not true. Some people even question whether GMO foods are a health threat at all, but if GMO foods bother you, those foods are quite easy to avoid.One way you can avoid GMO foods AND limit exposure to harmful chemicals is to eat organic when you can. But even if you can’t eat organic all that often, check out this information, which puts the question of “pesticides, chemical fertilizers, etc” into perspective:“A new study calculated that if half the U.S. population ate just one more serving of conventional fruits and vegetables, 20,000 cases of cancer could be prevented. At the same time the added pesticide consumption could cause up to 10 extra cancer cases. So by eating conventional produce we may get a tiny bump in cancer risk, but that’s more than compensated by the dramatic drop in risk that accompanies whole food plant consumption. Even if all we had to eat was the most contaminated produce the benefits would far outweigh any risks.” from: http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/25/apple-peels-turn-on-anticancer-genes/So, this idea that eating plants = eating chemicals = extremely harmful is a false equation. It is even more false when you understand the concept of bio-accumulation. If your friends think that those chemicals are bad for health, then they definitely shouldn’t be eating animal products since those chemicals get concentrated the higher you move up the food chain. http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=bioaccumulationThe above quote from Dr. Greger is also helpful because it starts to get at your first question: ” just how is plant-based diet is better?” A whole food plant based, such as the one that Dr Greger recommends (see link below), minimizes your risk of getting the major diseases of our time. Including: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc, etc, etc. You can see proof of this claim by watching the many videos on this site. I would summarize by saying that in general, whole, intact, minimally processed plant foods promote health and protect against diseases. Animal foods are strongly linked to increasing our risk of getting debilitating diseases and early death. The good thing is that you can get all this benefit while still eating great food! http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/I hope this helps. Let me know if you would like some advice on how to get started.Today I spoke with an oncologist with 30 years of experience. It was a casual conversation, I was not his patient. He said some positive things about the progress made on cancers and how rewarding his career has been, etc. I have SUCH skepticism now but I was polite and did not tell him I thought he full of bologna. My work in healthcare is becoming more and more uncomfortable for me. I am not sure what to do or what my next step could be. Doctor’s and hospitals scare me!totally. I’m a Feldenkrais Practitioner, which means I’m very far down the tree of treatment plans. I get back-pain patients who had surgery and 60-100 sessions of PT already, still all covered in sweat and taking strong pain medication because of high pain. It’s shocking how they have been treated. Doctors are very quick to take out the knife and to cut through flesh and bones. It’s their fav. They are butchers. Not all of them, of course, but too many of them.Dr. Greger, I want to educate people about nutrition, specifically about vegan nutrition. I know nutrition is nutrition, whether or not it’s vegan, but I personally want to teach people how to eat vegan in a healthy long term way. My conflict with this is what is best? Doctor, dietitian, nutritionist? I know you’re an amazing doctor when it comes to nutrition, but most doctors don’t learn about treating people through nutrition. What do you think is the best path? I’m sort of at a cross roads, because currently I’m majoring in mechanical engineering, and my engineering interests seem to have been high jacked by vegan education interests. It seems I can help more people, the planet, and animals, through health education…especially my close family. Thank you for taking the time to read and reply to this.Hi Erika. I think it really depends on where you see yourself working in the future. I think any position in healthcare would be important if you were to focus on nutrition. We sure are in need of health educators so I would recommend seeking out where you see yourself in a job setting (hospital, school, non-profit) and what that position may look like. Of course, medical school is 7+ yrs, and dietetic school perhaps on 4 depending on programs. Whatever you choose best of luck and keep us posted! If it’s helpful my journey started off cooking food for breast cancer survivors and lead to becoming a dietitian. Family will be difficult to help regardless of your profession ;-) They’re family.Thanks for your nice post and good luck with schooling moving forward! JosephI’m confused. Before statins my cholesterol was 219, then after I started, it dropped to 109 – prompting a switch to a milder statin, but that drop is not a 5% drop.I think everyone will have a different reaction to statins and the video is just talking about the benefits on average. I hope that helps clear the confusion. The good news is that your levels plummeted and now you are prompted to go on a lower dose!

If anyone is interested, here is plant positve’s dissection of the TIME article featured in this video. I think its great supplementary info. http://plantpositive.com/blog/2014/6/28/how-time-magazine-sacrificed-its-standards-to-promote-satura.htmlThe cliffhanger is too goodlooking forward to the next one! Thank you Michael!Okay, I don’t want to be the crankypuss here, but on the BIG issues, (meaning important, arguable, controversial, whatever) what is wrong with a bigger, longer video? Apparently it may be about actual production rather than attention spans, but I personally would love to see some longer videos on relevant topics instead of having it split in two! Like someone else suggested, this argument will come in handy, and it would be easier to link to a single video rather than multiples…and a lot more likely to get watched.It will certainly be in a playlist on youtube, so a proper link to that should have the videos play automatically, back to back. I agree with you though. I don’t really see the point of the split.I imagine nutritionfacts has thought about it.I would second your thought for share-ability…It is easier to share a longer video.I like both the long and the short videos. I think the short ones are useful for getting people to actually *watch* them – when I am linked to an hour long video, I know I will often abandon it before it has even started if I’m not strongly interested in the topic already.I would also like to see longer videos, maybe with the Dr. talking more slowly. I’m in no hurry. Thank you, nevertheless.I got some really nice pointers toward mental health from this butter pushing psychiatrist: http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.nl/p/map.htmlHer bits on magnesium and choline (zombieland prt 2) have already proven a big help in dousing the fire/heat that was raging in my upper spine and brain past few months. Yes I’m aware of the choline is bad bits on nutritionfacts, but low choline from near vegan diet might actually have caused mania in me. Supping my already high magnesium from foods with an additional 600-800 mg and 3-4 250mg choline already completely changed my outlook. Unexpectedly locking a gaze looking someone in the eye was like looking in a high powered light for me even 6 days ago, made me actually recoil as if in disgust, so overstimulating. 2 capsules of choline and I could mingle and look people in the eyes again. Completely bizarre! I hope this experience of mine can help somebody else, just paying it forward.PS: I just can’t shake the feeling her pushing saturated fats is killing people though ^^Missing from this story is the value of the low and mid chain saturated fatty acids. Seems we’re going backwards. The Texas A&M study (see http://www.frytest,com ) showed clearly that trans fact was the main culprit. The American Heart Assoc. was given $4 million to advertise and they pulled a fast one by attacking the “Bad Fat Brothers – Trans fats and saturated fats”. They went silent on saturated fats for a while and now are back with their standard confusion of the issues. Coconut oil is probably the healthiest fat in the world. The 50% fraction is lauric acid which is a natural antibiotic and it’s found naturally in mother’s breast milk. The 2 chain saturated fatty acid is vinegar. Lauric acid can be bought as “Monolaurin” in 600 mg and 300 mg. capsules.Coconut slams my veins shut the same as does other overly fatty food. As a male you can use the firmness of your erections as a barometer of this process. You can check your d*** Dick to see if your theory holds up. For me it has the same effect as have other high fat foods.Do some food experiments and change something every week or few weeks, some changes will give you solid feedback. Then ride the wave of stacked good effects, it is worth it even though it takes some discipline.Coconut oil is not the healthiest food in the world. Please provide studies to back up your claims. Every study I have seen with coconuts show increased LDL and total cholesterol, never the other way around. Please see here for more on coconuts.http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=coconutWhat is the other 50% ??????? Watch the videos Toxins references below!Just because mothers’ milk has some of that type of fat in it to help an infant grow quickly, doesn’t mean it’s good for an adult, and it doesn’t mean that consuming a significant percent of it is good either. To me, what’s in breast milk is irrelevant. The question is, what’s ‘optimal’ for adult human health.I bet the dairy industry’s tactics will ultimately backfire.with all these vegan and vegetarian diet , there is a danger of Niacin deficiency as well as missing out of the goodness of lactic acid which comes mainly from yougurt !!Huh? Lactic acid? (Which we make ourselves) I thought the main selling point for yogurt was the bugs.Yeah, a good run should solve that ^^As MacSmiley says, at least know what you’re pointing out if you’re going to make a comment. Not only is lactic acid produced by the human body (excessively as a byproduct of strenuous exercise), but lactose (which is what I think you’re trying to say) is actually a sugar that is present in all milk products (not mainly yogurt), and often a source of dietary distress. It’s one of the major food intolerances that leads to gastric issues. Lactose, even if you like and eat a lot of dairy, is hardly goodness. Oh, and regardless of which spelling of yogurt you prefer, you spelled it wrong.As for your comments below, you can cherry pick all kinds of studies about dairy being or not being healthy. Cherry-picked science never makes a point. Peer-reviewed, data-driven and empirically valid science and the volume of studies which support a particular finding/position, do make a point. Longitudinal studies that cover many years, like the Framingham heart study, are better cherry pickings than one that lasted two years. You can’t possibly draw a conclusion about long-term effects and health from one two-year window.Why are you concerned about deficiency. If you eat properly, from a variety of sources, you should be fine. Besides, you don’t say what kind of deficiency. B-12 is likely the only realistic potential issue, and it’s a stored vitamin, not one you need to replenish all the time. Calcium, protein and virtually all other nutrients are very plentiful in well-planned veg diets. In fact, most research suggests the SAD provides way more protein than needed, which often contributes to issues such as osteoperosis, when calcium is obtained by upping dairy intake. Processing excess protein leeches calcium from the bones and blood, often creating a vicious circle.A harvard study = heart problems is the biggest killer and milk seem to help a big deal here ——————A recent study, which followed more than 5,000 Spanish university graduates for about two years, found a link between dairy intake and risk of high blood pressure.”We observed a 50% reduction in the risk of developing high blood pressure among people eating 2-3 servings of low-fat dairy a day (or more), compared with those without any intake,” Alvaro Alonso, MD, PhD, a researcher in the department of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, said in an email interview.Although most of the low-fat dairy consumed by the study subjects was as milk, Alvaro believes low-fat yogurt would likely have the same effect.to clarify , I am a vegetarian but concern about deficiencyOh, and referring to your first comment, it’s niacin deficiency you’re concerned about? Really? You only need about 16mg a day and can easily obtain that from grains, nuts and many other vegetarian sources. A well-balanced diet can’t possibly leave you deficient. Sorry, but you really need to become better informed about nutrition. It’s not ideal, but if you’re really worried, take a multi. Lots of people do, even though most of it gets flushed out of your system when you pee and isolated vitamins have very little evidence of efficacy.Mr. Smith, Niacin deficiency is unlikely to occur if eating whole unrefined plant foods. This means whole grains, beans, fruits, veggies, tubers and the like. If you go to cronometer.com, you can track your nutrient intake., You would be surprised how much you are getting of each nutrient.Mr Smith: Your concern is quite understandable. Concern about developing a deficiency is one of the reasons people fear adopting a whole food plant based diet. Given all of the mis-information out there, I totally get why people are afraid. However, as NutritionFacts shows/as the body of evidence currently shows, a whole food plant based (WFPB) diet is the optimal diet for disease prevention for the majority of people (ie, baring some unique/rare issue with a person). A well planned WFPB diet is the one that is least likely to leave you with a deficiency. You are in the right place to educate yourself on this topic.Here is a nice, short video that talks about common deficiencies in vegans vs omnivores. You will notice that niacin is not among the problems that vegans typically face. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/I would also refer you to a great book by Brenda Davis and Vesanto Melina called Becoming Vegan, Express edition. These are extremely knowledgable registered dieticians who have taken a close look at the evidence in nutrition, and put together a great reference book for people who are concerned about particular nutrients. (It also has menu plans for putting it all together.) The book has a section on niacin that would interest you. It includes a list of the many easy ways to get plenty of niacin from a WFPB diet – so that you can get it in a safe package (as opposed to yogurt which has plenty of drawbacks).This site is a great place to educate yourself about the problems of eating any form of dairy: http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/Let me know if you would like some additional references that put it all together to show you how to eat healthy so that you avoid deficiencies. It’s not as hard as you might think!As a nutritionist, I have a real problem with these types of studies. And those who are promoting such biased, and fractionated information/disinformation. No wonder the public is confused!Nutrition is about biochemistry, enzyme function, and the nutrients in food needed to run those enzymes and our bodies. I applaud the poster below who had the intelligence to look to more than one site to solve his health problems. He or she could have a PEMT gene snp or any of the other gene snips that would take extra choline to make him feel better.All of us as a species need essentially the same nutrients, but biochemical individuality will make some people have to take more of some nutrients to get specific enzymes to function better or function at all. It is the reality of the human condition. Some people actually will need more animal protein and/or saturated fat in their diets because they will have snps on their LDL receptors that will make it more difficult to get cholesterol into the cell or other snps. (Yes, Virginia, cholesterol is a necessary molecule.) Vegan diets will make these people ill. Others thrive on a vegan diet (but B12 is still an issue here).The cholesterol theory of heart disease is dead. But that does not mean one should shun fresh veggies for nothing but huge steaks. It also does not mean that a little butter on one’s veggies or some beef in your diet is going to kill you either. NO ONE diet is right for everyone, and in my view, anyone who promotes that a vegan diet (or a paleo one) is the ONLY diet that everyone should follow, (albeit with all good intentions and ignorance of the true science of nutrition) is committing gross malpractice. Period.P.S. By stating that anyone or anything “seeks to undermine latest guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology.” implies of course that the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology know what they are talking about. And of course they don’t. Heart disease is at an all time high largely due to their recommendations , plus statin drugs are most likely the cause of the huge increase in congestive heart failure since their prescribing has become (too!) routine! Cardiologist Stephen Sinatra finally woke us as have other forward-thinking cardiologists.YOUR analysis of this is just so biased!!!1See how we’re not having a discussion? Slow down the dismissive rhetoric and bring some credible evidence for some of your claims, and we can have a more effective conversation. We need to get beyond mere expressions of our opinion. At the rate that we are going this probably means that the discussion should focus on actual references to peer reviewed literature that either you or I (or any other party to the discussion) think were well-conducted, because it seems that we simply may not trust each others’ authorities enough to follow them as closely as the other party wishes.I, for one, am not so interested in the fact that you trust Masterjohn’s narratives (or a substantial part of them). I want you to highlight some of his central claims that you think to be strong, and give some indication that you have thought carefully about how he has supported them. If you can do that, you will also have shown us some of the stronger evidence for his position and that actually will make me more interested in following his point of view if I can verify that the evidence is of good quality.Stephen Sinatra? You mean THIS Stephen Sinatra?http://youtu.be/XumPQLTzPWIWhat a pseudoscientific joke.“[…] implies of course that the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology know what they are talking about. And of course they don’t. Heart disease is at an all time high largely due to their recommendations”How can the current heart disease epidemic be the result of the AHA’s recommendations if no one is following them?“How Many Meet the Simple Seven” http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-meet-the-simple-seven/“[…] in U.S. adults, only about 1% have a bare minimum of healthy eating behaviors, such as five-a-day fruits and veggies, eating beans, whole grains, drinking less than 3 cans of soda a week. What percentage of Americans hit all seven of the simple 7? 14,000 men and women were surveyed, and most had 2 or 3 but hardly any had all 7 simple health components. Just how low a prevalence was having 7 out of 7? Only about 1 out of 2000 Americans had all 7 factors intact. And the one they were missing the most? Diet.”“How Many Meet the Simple Seven?” Boy I agree with you on this one! I go above and beyond the simple seven with platefuls of veggies at every meal. Yes even breakfast. Huge veggie smoothie. Even most vegans I meet don’t meet this guideline. Lots of white bread and white flour and a few green beans with a lot of beans or rice at supper and think they are eating healthy. Heavy on the starches, skimpy on the veggies. And most non vegans don’t meet this guideline either. But this is where I think the two sides are arguing over the wrong things. I don’t think whether someone eats some animal protein or not is the real problem or bashing each other because someone dared to eat something that had a face or came from a face. It is that vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores all need to be eating more veggies. Pile them on, baby!Linda, if you are unfamiliar with the issues of animal products detailed in Dr. Greger’s previous videos I would encourage you to view them. The reason to avoid animal products has pretty solid evidence and is not based on ethical arguments. http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=igf-1 http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=endotoxemiaOnce you view most of the evidence available on this website I find it rationally impossible to continue considering animal products a healthy part of a diet.Irrationality is in eye of the beholder. I have viewed these videos, and I still find that both camps cherry pick the evidence. I am not a vegan, cannot be a vegan, and will never be a vegan. I do not follow a paleo diet, cannot follow a paleo diet, and will never follow a paleo diet. I see followers of both camps in viciously poor health every day. And they are unwilling to change their thinking because they are blinded by whichever guru they have decided to follow. Real nutrition education lies in understand nutritional biochemistry. I think it bodes well for any lay person to do his or her own research in the area. I do so hope whichever diet you choose works for you in the long run. Most consequences don’t show up for years.I am confused by your response.“I have viewed these videos, and I still find that both camps cherry pick the evidence.”What evidence to the contrary can you present that a plant based diet will lead to ill health outcomes. Vegan does not equate to whole foods plant based, the discrepancy is important. You cite cherry picking, so please present studies to show how the studies presented here are at fault.“Real nutrition education lies in understanding nutritional biochemistry.”Most of the studies presented on this website are in regards to biochemistry. I don’t quite understand what specifics your asking for.” And sadly it is MD gurus doling out most of the misinformation because they get no training in nutrition in medical school and think that double blind studies are the be all end of evidence-based knowledge.”Dr. Greger is not giving us his medical opinion, he is presenting evidence available for the public to view. It is important to use the available evidence and view it in its entirety. Dr. Greger has never claimed that double blind studies are the only usable studies, he has stated otherwise on several occasions about the importance of longitudinal and cross sectional studies, and presents these in his videos. Based on your response, I get the idea you are not quite familiar with the evidence presented on this website. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of studies shared here supporting a plant based diet, along with contrary evidence presented and examined. There is no cherry picking. I have said this before. but because the evidence points towards a plant based diet does not mean that the science is biased. Its just how our body works. Our biology is the same.If you have studies to share then please do, I have not seen you share any evidence thus far in your posts.This will be my last post on this subject because the wars between the diet gurus gets old after awhile.The links you gave me led me to a menu of videos one of which was here: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/“The Answer to the pritikin puzzle” with McGregor’s [fractionated] analysis that “Lower cancer rates among those eating a plant-based diet may be a result of reduced blood levels of IGF-1 and enhanced production of IGF-1 binding protein.”Cancer is a complicated disease and boiling it down to IGF-1 and citing in vitro experiments where they drop blood on cancer cells in a petri dish and then implying that this proves that blood of those on vegan diets stop cancer growth in its tracks “in vivo” is ridiculous at it’s core. It’s cherry picking AND its misleading.Of course the blood of anyone eating any healthy diet pitted against the Standard American diet would win out in almost any nutrition study. Healthy diets should be full of veggies and moderate levels of fruit but they do not have to be vegan to be healthy,Also McGregor seems to conveniently forget to mention that Pritikin himself suffered from leukemia and eventually committed suicide due to his pain and suffering. It is postulated that while he had clean arteries, Pritkin’s diet may have been too low in protein which may also be one reason why it was so hard for adherents to stay on the diet. Cancer stresses the body, and cancer patients may need more protein especially if they are undergoing treatment which Pritikin was.http://www.livestrong.com/article/428130-calories-and-protein-needs-for-a-cancer-patient/ Written by Erica Wickham, M.S., R.D., C.D.N. and http://www.livestrong.com/article/264906-protein-for-cancer-patients/And here is a study Claiming that “A Low Carbohydrate, High Protein Diet Slows Tumor Growth and Prevents Cancer Initiation”http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/10/0008-5472.CAN-10-3973The Pritikin diet has also been shown to be too low in essential fatty acids which why some modern promoters of it often modify it to include a variety of omega-3 fat-containing fish at least twice a week and that those with coronary heart disease consume one gram of omega-3 fats per day.http://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/page3.htmNutrition studies have to take into consideration the TOTALITY of nutrition and biochemisty. By this I mean biochemical pathways, individual genetic snps, the totality of someone’s nutrition, whether they have all the necessary co-enzymes for proper enzyme functioning etc. etc.This is the totality of nutritional biochemistry. Not the continuing hammering and cherry picking of data between the diet gurus who want everyone to believe that their dietary beliefs with their cherry-picked studies are the be all end all of nutrition research.Linda“”The Answer to the pritikin puzzle” with McGregor’s [fractionated] analysis that …”This video is one video of an entire series on IGF-1. To look at this video alone and to come to wide conclusions would not be proper. Dr. Greger has shared studies how those with the lowest IGF-1 do not develop cancer (little people) and how elevated IGF-1 is linked with various forms of cancer. After all, IGF-1 is, in terms of biochemistry, responsible for cancer proliferation, survival, migration and angiogenesis. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19075184Hence, why IGF-1 is such an important hormone and lowering it would aid in cancer prevention.A systematic review and meta-analysis found strong associations with elevated IGF-1 and prostate cancer. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2743036/17 prospective studies found strong associations with breast cancer and elevated IGF-1 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3113287/It goes beyond blood dripped on petri dishes, and extrapolating that lower IGF-1 in vivo would result in lower cancer rates is not based on strict in vitro experiments. Researchers in the field of nutrition and cancer research recognize IGF-1 as a cancer promoter. This is not Dr. Greger’s own workings.Yes, cancer is a complicated disease, which is why that a diet with animal based foods does more than merely raise IGF-1 for cancer risk. By the same token, a plant based diet helps to prevent cancer by more then lowering IGF-1. There is a reason why there are a large quantity of association studies linking vegetarian diets with lower mortality from chronic diseases and meat intake linked with higher mortality and chronic disease. Good luck finding studies linking increased meat intake with lower cancer rates, these types of studies do not exist, because human bodies do not work this way. Here are some more cancer links in regards to meat based diets. You can see the studies cited in the sources cited section yourself, this is an easier way to present the studies though for your benefit.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-plant-based-diets/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-feeds-breast-cancer-cells/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carnitine-choline-cancer-and-cholesterol-the-tmao-connection/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-choline-and-cancer/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-as-an-autoimmune-disease/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-survival-the-av-ratio/ etc. etc.“And here is a study Claiming that “A Low Carbohydrate, High Protein Diet Slows Tumor Growth and Prevents Cancer Initiation””How much that can be extrapolated from these genetically altered, immune deficient mice in this study is extremely limited. After all, we have human data showing the opposite effect in the real world. For one that claims that studies are not the end result, I would have hoped a better portrayal of the contrary evidence, because this is not it. Studies must be viewed as pieces of a puzzle in the big picture. This is not what you are doing here.Your concern of those on a plant based diet not getting enough protein is also not based on the evidence. A recent study comparing 33,000 nonvegetarians to 4,000 semi vegetarians, 6,000 pesco vegetarians, 21,000 pesco vegetarians, and 5,000 strict vegans found that they all consumed about the same amount of protein, and all groups exceeded 70 grams per day. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23988511Less than 3% of adults in this country do not consume enough protein as table 1 shows in the below cited study. This perhaps could be due to caloric restriction, as protein deficiency cannot seem to exist without other nutritional deficiencies. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/87/5/1554S/T1.expansion.html“The Pritikin diet has also been shown to be too low in essential fatty acids which why some modern promoters of it often modify it to include a variety of omega-3 ..” If you are unaware, whole plant foods have plenty of omega 3. Even without flax seed and walnuts, the entirety of the diet over the course of a day can still have plenty of omega 3 as long as total omega 6 is low. Needs are 1.1 grams for women and 1.6 for men. There is no need to supplement fish oil.“Interest in the cardiovascular protective effects of n–3 (omega-3) fatty acids has continued to evolve during the past 35 y since the original research describing the low cardiovascular event rate in Greenland Inuit was published by Dyerberg et al. Numerous in vitro experiments have shown that n–3 fatty acids may confer this benefit by several mechanisms: they are antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, and antiarrhythmic. The n–3 fatty acids that have received the most attention are those that are derived from a fish source; namely the longer-chain n–3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n–3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n–3). More limited data are available on the cardiovascular effects of n–3 fatty acids derived from plants such as a-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n–3). Observational data suggest that diets rich in EPA, DHA, or ALA do reduce cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death; however, randomized controlled trial data are somewhat less clear. Several recent meta-analyses have suggested that dietary supplementation with EPA and DHA does not provide additive cardiovascular protection beyond standard care, but the heterogeneity of included studies may reduce the validity of their conclusions. No data exist on the potential therapeutic benefit of EPA, DHA, or ALA supplementation on those individuals who already consume a vegetarian diet. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to recommend n–3 fatty acid supplementation for the purposes of cardiovascular protection; however, ongoing studies such as the Alpha Omega Trial may provide further information.Combined with the lack of convincing clinical data in favor of n–3 fatty acid supplementation for cardiovascular endpoints and the lack of data in those that consume a vegetarian diet, it is difficult to make the recommendation that vegetarians should consume fish to optimize their cardiovascular mortality.”http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/5/1597S.long“Nutrition studies have to take into consideration the TOTALITY of nutrition and biochemistry. ” Again, we are dealing with humans who are extremely similar with little genetic variation. To assume that everyone is genetically broken is a leap in logic. You have provided several articles to livestrong and random websites, these are not studies, nor sources of evidence. This website is not about propping up Dr. Greger’s dietary regime, it is about sharing STUDIES. That is its main function.I agree, but I post as a layperson who reads and eats, nothing more. I’m always interested in professionals who do post, their affiliations and how they’re paid. I’m not at all suggesting anything, but to suggest this information is any more biased than dairy/meat industry funded research, is a little bit of kettle and teapot stuff. Your Disqus history suggests you regularly attack this site’s posts and other things, like the benefits of grain, which is fine. Anything public should hold up to scrutiny and debate. You could easily link your Disqus profile to your website or some professional profile. You do seem to have a strong paleo-oriented approach. I’m totally open about a largely plant-based bias, but I also don’t think diets with some meat and dairy can be perfectly health (personally, not ethically or environmentally).The only thing I’d say about paleo is not so much whether a high protein/high fat/grain-free diet is healthy or not, rather that the notion that current paleo is anything close to how cavemen ate has been debunked. I’m not a vegan myself, but statistically I think you’re likely to find a lot less disease (via long-term studies) with it than you will with a paleo style of diet (which needs more time for any decent level of evidence).Also, the fact that people speak totally about ‘personal’ health and not holistic health is problematic to me. Meat and dairy production is inherently cruel and environmentally problematic. In terms of what we do to the planet we live on, and its inhabitants, focusing totally on nutrition and not the others is a lapse in logic. Current animal-derived food production is very damaging. ‘ethical’ or ‘sustainable’ or ‘humane’ meat is a serious fallacy due to lack of enforceable standards and the actual definition of free-run and free-range.They don’t like me on the paleo blogs either! LOL. I think grains are toxic, but not because they are grains. It is the mold in them because they sit around gathering mold in the grain bins. Thus I use quinoa and buckwheat as my grain substitutes. (Something the paleo bloggers go nuts about and trash me there for because they are so carb-phobic. I do agree that current animal-derived food production is very damaging. And these meats do contain more saturated fat than wild counterparts. Thus I look for naturally raised/organic animal products. I do not eat/drink dairy. Too allergic. I do think that most all industrialized nations eat too many grains to the exclusion of veggies!! I know paleo eaters who just down the commercial steaks and butter and if there are 3 asparagus on the plate they think they have had enough veggies for the day. I also know vegans living on rice and beans and sugar-laden fruit pies that are convinced that they are never going to get heart disease who become very surprised when the heart attack comes. (If they survive it!) I myself favor a mostly Mediterranean-style diet but again no one diet is right for everyone.If both camps don’t like you, you’re probably doing something right ;-) I don’t preach (or try not to), but do come primarily from the animal welfare side of the equation. I don’t distinguish between rights and welfare because the distinction is meaningless if we have a strong standard of care for all animals. Anyway I digress.Organic meat is definitely a step in the right direction and if it suits you personally, then it’s certainly an improvement. For me, there is simply too much suffering and/or pollution no matter which direction one goes for meat and dairy. I don’t eat any eggs, meat, fish or fowl but there is a very small amount of dairy in my diet. Cream in my coffee and occasionally some cheese, but very little. In most cases I use almond milk – love the flavour but not the consistency for many things. The best we can do is what works for us, while hopefully reducing the impacts of our choices.I like quinoa but it’s another potential digestive mess and I do find it causes gut problems for me. I’d agree we use too many grains, and in particular, the vast majority of commercial cereals and related products are so processed and sugar-laden that they’re not healthy. Plus, there’s so much sugar in so much of it. As for meat and veggies, the reason cardiovascular disease is so much lower with traditional “3rd world” and many Asian diets, is that meats augment a largely vegetable dinner plate, not the other way around. There’s just too much meat in most diets.Just like we often don’t talk about the holistic impacts of food choices, the other piece is exercise, of course. As a 50 year old with some family diabetes history, that’s my biggest concern and I’ll admit to something of a sweet tooth. It doesn’t absolve me of course, but I’m also an avid runner and cyclist. Depending what time of year it is, I’m doing anywhere from 10-20 hours a week. You can’t outrun a bad diet, particularly as you age, but you can sure use up some of the excess calories your body will convert to fat and you can do a lot to keep your blood pressure, blood sugar and triglycerides fairly normal by getting a good amount of fitness in.I’ll agree on the mostly Mediterranean style diet and that one definitely doesn’t fit all, but again, between food choices and lifestyle, regardless of what we choose to eat, a lot more thought about where it comes from and what else we’re doing is very important.I don’t have any problem eating animals as long as they are raised humanely, had a nice life before I ate them, and were killed humanely as well. I obviously do not want antibiotics and chemicals in my food either. These become necessary in Confined animal raising methods.I do agree that for most people using animal protein as more of a condiment than as the main dish is very wise, as most Asian countries do. But there are always biochemical exceptions. Those with genetic defects that require more methionine are but one example.Everything on this plane of existence eats and is eventually eaten. Bugs will eat us too when we are put into the ground. Energy is neither created nor destroyed. Just moved around. Such is the cycle of life. Total veganism is a relatively new. Even Vegans in India eat bugs (if inadvertently) in their grains and veggies, thus getting more complete protein than is otherwise calculated for in todays charts.I understand and totally sympathize with your ethical concerns. But for me the nutrition is the main focus.Processed grains and cereals and sugar and GMO’s Yuck! And, yes, exercise is another key factor, as is lifestyle. One overlooked aspect of health is all the toxic chemicals we put in and on our bodies today and that is a discussion for another day~You said this: “I don’t have any problem eating animals as long as they are raised humanely, had a nice life before I ate them, and were killed humanely as well.”By the same token, you shouldn’t have any problems if a more intelligent species arrives and does that to you. If you are raised “humanely” and killed “humanely” for the sake of their gluttony.But I suspect that seeing yourself in the other end you would claim against that “arrangement”Well those animals know and feel exactly as you, the IQ difference doesn’t change a thing.And if you feel that my example is extreme, know that in meso America people were raised as catlle (in great numbers) exactly for this end.Linda, instead of buying into the myths and lies fed to us by our culture and society, not top mention a few words on a label, why not investigate the matter for yourself. btw, you may be surprised to know that there are cultures who have been vegan for thousands of years-veganism is only a “new concept” in the western world.youtube.com/watch?v=R-W3xi2jMYIfreefromharm.org/animal-products-and-ethics/factory-farming-alternative-farming/bitesizevegan.com/ethics-and-morality/vegan-nugget-7-humane-free-range-cruelty-free/This is quite enlightening. What happens to the waste matter on factory farm. http://www.upworthy.com/a-drone-flew-over-a-pig-farm-to-discover-its-not-really-a-farm-its-something-much-more-disturbing?c=aol1&icid=maing-grid7%7Chtmlws-main-bb%7Cdl27%7Csec3_lnk4%26pLid%3D593426 North Carolina Pig FarmDrones are a valuable tool to root out environmental degradation like this. They have many other positive uses as well.As long as you eat animal products knowing the side effects for them and the environment, that has to be your call. I would dispute though, that even in a so-called ‘humane’ environment, they can possibly have a nice life. Again, humane meat is really a pipe dream. Intentions are part of being humane. It’s simply a value judgement to me that raising an animal to kill it is inhumane, no matter how I treat it.“were killed humanely as well” Is there really such a thing as humanely killed? Sounds like fantasy.As a dietician, (if you that’s what you mean by nutriitonist), it is your duty to have an evidence based approach and not fall for fad dietary trends. It is an indisputable fact that not a single person needs dietary cholesterol (unless with a rare genetic deficiency) or saturated fat. These are simply undebatable facts.“Saturated fatty acids are synthesized by the body to provide an adequate level needed for their physiological and structural functions; they have no known role in preventing chronic diseases. Therefore, neither an AI nor RDA is set for saturated fatty acids.There is a positive linear trend between total saturated fatty acid intake and total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration and increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). A UL is not set for saturated fatty acids because any incremental increase in saturated fatty acid intake increases CHD risk.”“Given the capability of all tissues to synthesize sufficient amounts of cholesterol for their metabolic and structural needs, there is no evidence for a biological requirement for dietary cholesterol. Therefore, neither an Adequate Intake nor a Recommended Dietary Allowance is set for cholesterol.There is much evidence to indicate a positive linear trend between cholesterol intake and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, and therefore increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). A Tolerable Upper Intake Level is not set for cholesterol because any incremental increase in cholesterol intake increases CHD risk.”http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10490&page=542Elevated cholesterol is also required for heart disease to occur, there is no other factor more important that can result in plaque build up other than cholesterol.Go read Chris Masterjohn on this issue. He has a Ph.D in in Nutritional Sciences. When he stopped eating meat and eventually all animal products, his health took a real hit. He had to go back to eating animal products. Eventually his 23andMe profile showed genetic snps that explained why he became so sick. He has it all over RD’s whose training is designed by the USDA, which is, of course, beholden to all food industries.“Elevated cholesterol is also required for heart disease to occur, there is no other factor more important that can result in plaque build up other than cholesterol” Bologna. Dr. Sinatra (cardiologist) found out how false that statement is when he went into practice. He found people with very low LDL”s and cholesterol just full of clogged arteries when he did tests, and found others with cholesterol numbers as high as 350 with whistle clean arteries. Only then did he start to look deep and found that there was much more to the biochemistry of heart disease than we have been led to believe. Remember, an awful lot of money is made on drugs that lower cholesterol, and drug companies run the health care show in this country. Yes, they even dictate to the government. And they will threaten anyone whose views they think will rain on their gravy train.Chris Masterjohn is a classic paleo “confusionist” spreading misinformation and claims without base. His anecdotal account of being vegetarian also has little value for this discussion and his advice is hardly scientific regardless of his pedigree. You can see all about that here. http://plantpositive.com/blog/2012/3/26/tpns-42-the-confusionist-mind-and-the-good-old-days.html http://plantpositive.com/22-cholesterol-confusion-5-choYour last paragraph is also not based on the evidence. Here is the link between cholesterol and heart disease that has been proven in hundreds of studies.http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=363237http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=373603“This systematic review and meta-regression analysis of 108 randomised controlled trials using lipid modifying interventions did not show an association between treatment mediated change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk ratios for coronary heart disease events, coronary heart disease deaths, or total deaths whenever change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol was taken into account. We found a statistically significant, substantial association between change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk ratios for coronary heart disease events, coronary heart disease deaths, or total deaths, adjusted for other lipid subfractions and drug class.” http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b92This study looked at 13,148 participants using an ultrasound to measure arterial wall thickness. “In general, wall thickness increased with increasing intake of animal fat, saturated and monounsaturated fat, cholesterol and Keys’ score and decreased with increasing intake of vegetable fat…the association between diet and wall thickness was in the expected direction in all race-sex groups.”http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/139/10/979.abstractThere has never been a single study showing that increasing saturated fat leads to less heart disease. Not one. In addition to the many other studies showing this link, animal models clearly show that a pattern of high fat diets leads to heart disease. There has never been an animal model showing that atherosclerosis was created with carb feeding but many with saturated fat feeding. A high fat diet has never reversed heart disease. The only diet to ever reverse heart disease is a low fat, plant based diet very high in carbohydrates. http://www.jfponline.com/fileadmin/qhi/jfp/pdfs/6307/JFP_06307_Article1.pdf http://www.pmri.org/publications/1761.pdf“Chris Masterjohn is a classic paleo “confusionist” spreading misinformation and claims without base. ” This is a classic example of attacking the messenger, so I pay it no attention. Whatever you think of Chris Masterjohn, he has a Ph.D in Nutrition Science and you do not. That makes him better at understanding the limitations of most nutritional studies, including those posted here by Dr. Gregor. As far as I am concerned NO MD is qualified to give advice on Nutritional matters unless they actually have studied nutrition. They studied disease (symptom clusters) and drug therapies for suppression, not cure.Masterjohn is not the messenger of truth Linda, he is someone who is spreading misinformation. Like I said, his degree does not make him an authority. It makes no difference what someones degree is in, they have to use studies and evidence to back up their claims regardless of who they are. That is what I have provided you with and that is what you are depriving me of. If you viewed the links to plant positive you would see how Masterjohn does not have a coherent view of the evidence.I have viewed the links to plant positive. Find them incomplete and cherry picked. Both sides of the diet wars have this same problem. If you believe that Dr. Masterjohn does not have a coherent view of the evidence, that is your choice of course. I suspect, however, that your being a NF team member can cause you to be biased to any evidence that does not support the views of this site. That would make you not be able have a coherent view of any evidence that does jive with your own beliefs. The very thing of which you are accusing Dr. Masterjohn.As I stated to James. I am not a paleo promoter. Nor am I a promoter of vegan diets or any other diet. I thought I knew all about nutrition from physician blogs too…until I went back to school.I don’t need to tell you where to find opposing evidence. I am sure you can do that for yourself.Is this Dr Sinatra you mention, reversing and totally curing heart disease JUST with his diet? Present the cases, then.Dr Esselstyn does exactly that, he has hundreds of cases, terminal ones, and brought them back to heal and yes, of course clean arteries with a WFPB diet. Show the evidence that the diet you promote HEAL hundreds of terminal patients. Not hearsay or anecdotal evidence, but as a treatment that is being done every day. We are waiting.If you’re going to start pushing Masterjohn as some sort of authority, you’re losing any possible goodwill you were building with me. Hardly the ‘science’ you claim to value, and validating (as I initially suspected) your paleo leanings. Most claims of paleo have zero longitudinal shelf life for validity and have nothing to do with how our forebears actually ate. I guess Robb Wolf is next? Or what about the claim that everyone can have grass-fed meat, despite the fact that our planet could come nowhere near producing enough grass-fed meat without making it inhabitable.I am not pushing Dr. Mastejohn as some kind of authority. But he does have credentials. As do some vegan nutritionists I knows. Believe what you will. James. I do not eat paleo, nor am I a vegan, Also I need no ones’ good will. I don ‘t get destroyed just by blogger’s opinions of me. I just am interested in nutrition. That is why I went back to school. But I have also found that cholesterol is not the boogie man either. As I stated before, some people do well on a well-planned vegan diet and thrive on it. For others it is disastrous and wrecks their health. It all depends upon biochemical individuality. If you want to shoot the messenger because you do not like the message, be my guest. I thought I knew all about nutrition too…until went back to school.I’m not going to debate you any more Linda, as you’re passive-aggressive in your approach. This is twice now you’ve made a statement like, “I thought I knew all about nutrition too…until went back to school.” First, I’ve never suggested I knew all about nutrition, though this kind of comment suggests both I’m clueless and you’re educated and well informed. Neither is true, and your bias toward a paleo diet comes through in everything you say, though you keep saying you don’t have one.You keep claiming things for which little empirical evidence exists and try to veil that fact by suggesting you’re educated and everyone who doesn’t think your way, including government agencies, are idiots.Whether you look at the Framingham study, much of the work of ‘real’ doctors like Dean Ornish (who’ve not only been able to stop, but reverse heart disease through lifestyle changes which include low fat vegan diets) and countless others, plant-based diets have longitudinal data that shows they work.Thousands of nutritionists/dieticians and health professionals understand that healthy, natural carbs are our primary fuel source, yet somehow you’ve got magic knowledge that suggests more fat, more protein and fewer carbs is healthier. High protein diets are hard for our bodies to manage, fat is harder to access as fuel. That’s simple body chemistry. And, no I don’t need to go to school to understand that, as I’ve got solid reading skills. Paleo proponents, through how they cherry-pick and conduct themselves, are akin to climate change deniers, in everything from science/evidence denial, to finding random and uncommon conditions for which standard dietary evidence doesn’t apply, then claim that’s why the approach is completely invalid.Until you actually indicate what your credentials are and link to some kind of resource on the web as proof, you’re just coming off as a crackpot with a chip on your shoulder.“Yet somehow you’ve got magic knowledge that suggests more fat, more protein and fewer carbs is healthier” I Never said any such thing. So this is a straw man argument because you have determined with no justification that I have Paleo leanings. I did say that for some people having a lower carb diet can be useful and I stand by that statement. And I will add now that diabetes and/or obesity are two good examples. In other ways, most people could use more carbs in the form of veggies rather than grains, especially processed grains. But most people can and do eat a balanced diet which includes grains with no problem. I do believe that Beans are great as they are very slow absorbing and most people could stand to eat more of them. The Paleo people would obviously not agree with me, however. If I did have paleo leanings it would be my concern, but since I lean neither towards paleo nor vegan, passive aggressive allegations that imply that to have Paleo is irrelevant. and ridiculous. It is like calling someone a women to insult them. It is what it is, The paleo people throw out the accuasations about vegans that come to there sites and it serves no purpose in my view. I do have credentials (both from the UK and the US) but feel no need to justify myself here, nor post them on the internet where they can be stolen or altered.On paleo blogs to be called a vegan is an insult. And of course on vegan blogs to be called a paleo follower is an insult. What nonsense. I think both sides do themselves an injustice by playing this sort of game and failing to look at nutrition as a whole or nutritional biochemistry as the science that it is.I do also see a lot of bloggers on both sides of the isle making statements that have no basic in nutritional biochemisty. And I defended one blogger with a Master’s degree on that issue. If we could not get energy from fats by turning them into ketones or turn proteins into glucose by gluconeogenesis we would be in pretty bad trouble. Our bodies have several pathways for getting the energy that we need. Eskimos lived for long periods on a high fat, high protein diet and adapted, but there is a study some place on the internet in a clinical nutrition journal that talks about how they probably were able to do that because of the high level of potassium and minerals in water supplies near by. The Citric acid cycle pathway does need a small amount of glucose to prime the pump so to speak but that would be a biochemical discussion for another time.And I am not in agreement with some paleo proponents that ancient man lived solely on low glycemic leafy veggies and meats he could hunt or eggs he could gather. There is some evidence that ancient man knew very well how to dig up roots and tubers.And, a diet without plenty of fruits and veggies (Veggies in my book more than fruits as they were always seasonal before modern times.) is deficient in so many nutrients that I do not think good health can be obtained without them.What bothers me about most posts on both the paleo and vegan blogs is an unwillingness to look at nutrition as whole and unwillingness to look at anything the other side has to say because the posters appear to so wedded to their believe systems that they are blinded to any other views. There are plenty of studies on both sides of the isle.Sad. Sad for them, Sad for Dr, Gregor, and Sad for the paleo proponents as well.Masterjohn is not really paleo. He’s been a Weston Price apologist since 2005 or before. His PhD is a RECENT acquisition, for which he was motivated by WAPF to obtain for the purpose of lending some legitimacy to his advocacy of their organization and dietary tenets.That hardly makes him the most reliable of sources.Agreed, the paleoechochamber is hardly anything you want to bother with.Hey Toxins, Lawrence posted a link to a Klaper presentation below, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tJyb1wTxg4#t=133, explaining his theory as to why longtime meat eaters taking in exogenous choline for several decades from childhood have permanently downregulated endogenous choline genes/enzymes and that is why they have a hard time quitting meat – quite simply it is a very physical addiction, hard to break like heroin.The Economist has fallen as well. https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/posts/10152978299379060Aren’t healthy saturated fats (ex. coconut milk) ok if you’re on a low carb diet (20% of your foods are from carbs) since cholesterol isn’t oxidized on a low carb diet?Sorry, but why would you target only 20% carbs? While paleo and vegan folk will argue percentages endlessly, this is pretty low for most kinds of energy needs. A healthy lifestyle includes moving your body and healthy carbs are the best fuel for that, due to conversion to energy. Your body has a much harder time converting fat into energy.Agreed, James. Having said that however, some people might indeed have to go on a relatively low carbohydrate diet for a while to rebalance. Insulin resistance due to obesity comes to mind here.Yes, but we have to speak in generalities when we’re discussing here. There are always edge cases that require special treatment. Vegan can’t work for everyone, but based on current research, well-planned vegan diets will provide very solid nutrition and much less chronic disease than either the SAD or what is currently called paleo to make it more palatable.Hi phil, coconut milk and oil actually raise cholesterol levels. In addition, about a third of the saturated fat is long chain. Cholesterol oxidation is not necessary for heart disease to occur.LDL does not have to be oxidized to enter the endothelium and become foam cells, the beginning stages of heart disease. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2877120/Nonoxidized LDL’s typically precede accumulation in aortic lesions, thus LDL does not have to be oxidized. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1850639/In human models,LDL is higher on a saturated fat rich diet, saturated fat increases insulin production, the accumulation of liver fat was also present on a saturated fat diet. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/95/5/1003.longPlease see here for morehttp://nutritionfacts.org/?s=coconuthttp://plantpositive.com/ , watch even parts and you will never go low carb again ^^ ( I liked his Taubes series much better that his bro science series Toxins, well till part 8 at least ^^)His taubes series is really good, as well as the “drivers of the heard” and the cholesterol confusion series.Dr. Greger at NutritionFacts.org shows that a vegan diet is “maybe too effective” at treating heart disease, obesity, and most numbers (“biometrics”) of internal medicine, inside and out. A diet without animals can even reverse cancer and has immediate and lasting effect on heart disease. This site both recommends no saturated fat from animals and recommends limited plant saturated fats and less cholesterol just from animals and more fiber just from plants. Walnuts, which are almost entirely fat and have saturated fat, are so heart healthy not eating them is a risk factor for heart disease. Eating Cocoa several times a week can reduce your risk of heart disease by half, although Dr. Greger doesn’t like the industry funding of dark chocolate research. Dark Chocolate is also high in saturated fat. This site, and many people who post here, do not recommend olive oil or coconut oil (one of the most purchased grocery items on Amazon.com) because they add calories without nutrition or have dangerous amounts of saturated fat. Pistachios, almonds, walnuts were very hearth healthy. Meat is very heart unhealthy, and cholesterol from diary and meat should be eliminated or drastically limited according to this site and Kaiser Permanante. On the nutrition label, less than 20 grams of saturated fat a day are recommended. Perhaps we should get half that from nuts, seeds, and dark chocolate. Diary has been linked to prostate cancer. If that’s true, there doesn’t seem to be any safe animal product. Eating less plant fat, while maximizing health benefits of plant fats like nuts, maybe is healthier than eating a high fat plant diet, based on the fact that posters here do not find coconut oil and olive oil. Less meat and diary has been linked to lower amounts of disease and can treat disease at any point in life, and beans, nuts, cocoa, green or matcha tea, berries, whole grain, fresh fruits, veggies, the best spices, mushrooms, nori, flax seed meal, less of more plant based meals all year, could add life to your years and value to your life.First, let me say that I have a Master’s in Nutrition and am a licensed nutritionist. I am also no stranger to the sway food/chemical/pharmaceutical industry conglomerates impact our lives via what they pay the goverment and what we see at grocery stores and in advertising. That being said, of course the dairy industry wants to drive sales, all businesses want to drive sales. I may be digressing here, however, unlike this video, there is a lot of evidence supporting a high-fat, low-carbohyrate (grain) diet, namely a ketogenic diet or high fat, paleo-type diet for improving overall health (50-80% of calories from fat). Low fat diets tend to be to high in grains, gluten and added sugar which is fueling our chronic disease epidemic. This year, as a country, Sweden openly rejected low fat diets: http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/sweden-becomes-first-western-nation-to-reject-low-fat-diet-dogma-in-favor-of-low-carb-high-fat-nutrition/This eating style helps the body tap into it’s fat stores for energy (ketosis) and not rely on sugar (glucose) for energy. Benefits include better satiety, better blood biomarkers and ketones are a preferred source of energy for the brain (see Dr. Perlmutter’s website, author of Grain Brain or Dr. William Davis’ website, author of Wheat Belly). I am not saying that fat should solely come from animal products as they are acidifying, but rather from a variety of 100% grass-fed, full fat dairy (because grass-fed is higher in omega 3 fats vs conventioally raised animals), avocados, olives, a variety of nuts, coconut milk/oil, MCT oil, chia seeds, flax oil, 100% pastured eggs, etc. This also encompasses a diet high in fruits and vegetables, at least 30% raw, little to no grains, high-quality meat products (again, pasture raised) and plenty of water. Anecdotally I have witnessed my own HDL increase to 65, LDL stay the same, triglycerides plummet to less than 50, inflammatory markers decrease and fasting glucose stabalize at 82. This also reflects what is demonstrated in studies: Long-term effects of a ketogenic diet in obese patients: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2716748/ Low-Carbohydrate Diets: http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/low-carbohydrate-diets/Meta-analysis’ are also disproving the AMA’s (American Heart Association) guidelines. From March 2014 in the Annal of Internal Medicine: Association of Dietary, Circulating, and Supplement Fatty Acids with Coronary Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: http://annals.org/mobile/article.aspx?articleid=1846638 reviewed 49 observational studies and 27 randomized controlled trials concluded “Current evidence does not Cleary support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of poly-unsaturated fats and low consumption of total saturated fats.”I hope this is food for thought.You said:“This eating style helps the body tap into it’s fat stores for energy (ketosis) and not rely on sugar (glucose) for energy. ”No, it doesn’t “help” the body — You are starving it of its natural fuel, to be in permanent ketosis is by no means what nature intended.And is strongly linked to many autodegenerative diseases.See this one just to begin:http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-grain-brain-or-meathead/I really like your comment here. Did you know that Dr. Adkins was fat? Did you know that he died of heart disease? You have shown that people can live without cholesterol. Are vegetarians real? Could it mean you eat one meal a day without meat? Do you think veganism is extreme? Are you proud of your diet? Would you share some of your fasting asceticism with everybody by saying you can say you are a vegitarian if you go without meat one meal a week to start? I was hoping if you are so self-denying you share your humble with the rest of us by giving us a place to start. Just they say to exercise five minutes a day at a moderate pace would be better than one half an hour a day because not a lot of people can do that. If you would share you kind indulgences by saying going with less meat would be better of us more of us would be like you. When the threshold is too high people will just eat pork! Everybody wants to be like you. So cool.@Matthew, frankly I would think that you were very sarcastic there, if wasn’t because I see your other comments on this site.First, despite that the Atkins foundation tries their best to hide it, it is well know how Dr Atkins died, so yes I knew it.Second of course vegetarians are real. :)India is largely a vegetarian country, and East Asian countries have large segments of vegetarians, pretty usual among Buddhist and Jainist, even if is just a cultural legacy, as happens in India. And they were vegetarians for thousand of years, isn’t a new thing.We as a species are naturally herbivores, as all primates — there is nothing extraordinary in eating as you were designed to.I don’t get from where you get any fasting asceticism on my part? Since you are interested, I am vegan. Nothing of meat any day of the week or anything like that, nor any other animal products.I never liked meat tho, none in my father side of the family do. So I have the advantage that before being vegan I was a natural, ovolacto vegetarian. Mostly lacto vegetarian, I didn’t eat a lot of eggs, neither I liked fish… Because all this for me is pretty easy being vegan. Yet, I would do it anyway because of health reasons (if you check the data as you are doing here, there is only one reasonable way to go) And also, I would keep from contributing to nightmarish industries. I don’t think we have the right to do what is being done to billions and billions of animals. We kill them, but what goes around comes around, people are paying the price for it.I didn’t mean to be sardonic, I really think vegans like you are cool. Frankly, some of your prestige drives people away, or rather we are surprised at your stoicism. Thank you for telling me there are vegetarian cultures, like in India. They must be a culture of cool people. They must also be very healthy! Would you welcome people to eat less meat like you, for partial health benefits or do you not proselytize? I find you inspiring. I frequently find myself questioning how a doctor would actually recommend the diet. Dr. Ornish had such great success, but most doctors are too floored by your integrity to believe they too eat mostly plants.You don’t need a lot of stoicism to change your diet, try substitutes first. Instead of dairy, try the many varieties of plant milk in the market, so with meat and other products. There are even vegan cheese and ice cream, a lot of varieties. Check labels tho, to make sure they don’t have coconut oil, but if you are between dairy ice cream, and cheese, vs vegan version that might include coconut oil… still this one would be the better option. (Just as last resource) Try versions without that kind of oil if you can.Take a look to this:http://www.pcrm.org/health/diets/kickstart/kickstart-programs/Thank you so much for your recommendations and your links. I can quick start my life at any time with them and if ever anyone had heart disease these could be a go-to guide. I have heard that some people plan on converting to devotion on their death bed. This is an okay strategy, but what about sudden death? I am planning on converting to veganism if I have heart disease, but Dr. Greger said that half of heart diseases are sudden. What a similar situation! The less meat I eat the healthier my heart is. Thanks to your help, I have put a vegan plan in place for myself for heart health. Thank you for peace.This actually could be an extremely long response but I am replying from my phone so I don’t want to type an essay. I will argue that the body does need a small amount of glucose, but runs very well on ketones. There is also a varying degree of ketosis- ranging from mild to severe. A mild range would still incorporate 50-100 grams of carbs/day. Ancestorally, I will also argue that our predecessors were not baking of bread, drinking soda or making noodles. They also didn’t get 3 square meals a day (check out intermittent fasting). Just these things require the body to adjust to tap into the fat stores for energy. It’s very efficient. On a cellular level more mitochondria are created. This is indeed a form of ketosis. Fast forward today- we have obesity, diabetes which are sugar regulating disorders. These people have plenty of glucose and are parodoxilly starving. They have plenty of body fat but have trained their bodies (aka hormonal cascade) to rely on sugar so much that it can’t even access it’s own fat for energy. These people literally feel starving all of the time. Enter to ketogenic diet. It works wonders.Thank you Miranda for your post. All views need to be aired here. Today’s diets do indeed promote sugar regulating disorders. One can indeed be obese and malnourished at the same time. See it all the time.Our ancestors, as all primates were eating plant food, which is complex carbohydrates. That is the natural fuel for the body. If you starve it of its natural fuel, before dying would use anything, like trying to use fat in a very inefficient conversion. And you are in an unhealthy starving mode.Regarding diabetes, it is exactly the opposite of your tale. You can completely reverse type II diabetes with a WFPB diet. No insulin needed anymore. It heals it and prevent it. While animals products trigger it. The direct relationship between high meat, eggs and milk consumption and diabetes — the rich western diet. Every place since, as they adopt the same diet, gets diabetes, heart disease and cancer among other degenerative diseases, exactly as happened in the West before.Dr Greger:” Plant-based diets (especially whole foods) may successfully prevent, treat, and even reverse type 2 diabetes (see also here, here).Excluding meat, milk (see also here), and other animal products may reduce the risk of diabetes and gestational diabetes by boosting our hormone-binding proteins, helping to prevent obesity, and reducing exposure to arsenic, BPA, dioxins, nitrites, and PCBs.Eggs may be particularly risky – eating only one egg a week may almost double the odds of getting diabetes. Fish, especially salmon, is one of the primary sources of PCBs and other industrial toxins, which may play a role in the development of diabetes.Indian gooseberries (amla), coffee, soy, flaxseeds, green tea, pulses (dried beans), chamomile tea, purple potatoes, a href=”http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-sprouts-vs-supplements/”>broccoli sprouts, whole grains, vinegar, and beans may be protective. Beans may be especially beneficial when replacing meat or refined carbs, such as white rice. Cinnamon, depending on the variety, it may be either too toxic for consumption at high doses or ineffective at treating diabetes. Diabetes drugs, on the other hand, have been found to increase the risks of heart attack, heart failure, and death, and regular exercise and weight-loss may work just as well against diabetes. Erythritol is a nontoxic sugar substitute. By eating plant-based and living a healthy lifestyle, 90%-95% of type 2 diabetes is avoidable. If left untreated, diabetes can cause blindness. Untreated type 1 diabetes can even be fatal. Babies fed baby formula seemed to have a higher risk of obesity, type 1 and type 2 diabetesDr. Greger covers diabetes in his full-length presentations: • Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death • More Than an Apple a Day: Combating Common Diseases • From Table to Able: Combating Disabling Diseases with Food ”For all the embedded links in the article, check http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/I agree with all of that. The Ketogenic diet encompasses lots of vegetables, some fruit, lots of non-animal fat choices as well as animal meat/fat. I listed the foods included in an earlier post.Except these things: Ketogenic diets have been shown in a number of studies to be more effective, faster and easier to follow than diets that are low glycemic and have 55% calories from food to treat diabetes http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1743-7075-5-36.pdfEggs are not dangerous and do not promote diabetes. And actually the body makes about 80% of our cholesterol so the diet only plays a small role in cholesterol levels. This site cherry picks data. Further, higher cholesterol levels are cardio protective for older women. Also there are different types of cholesterol with some being more atherogenic than others and lipoproteins that are worse than others EX LP(a) AND our ancient blood testing from PCPs doesn’t routinely test inflammatory markers which are directly correspond with cardiac events like CRP or homocysteine nor do PCPs routinely check insulin levels which happens to be a faster indicator of blood sugar dysregulayion. Oxidized proteins and cholesterol stick to arteries. Oxidation is largely from excess blood sugar (carbohydrates) floating around creating advanced glycated end products; caramelized blood. A1C actually measures this. Oh, here’s the egg articles from Harvard and webmd. http://www.m.webmd.com/diabetes/news/20141009/eggs-type-2-diabeteshttp://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/eggs/“And actually the body makes about 80% of our cholesterol so the diet only plays a small role in cholesterol levels.”Given the academic credentials and professionalism that you claim, this comment displays a profound lack of curiosity about the mainstream position to which you must respond. Dietary cholesterol is not proposed to be dangerous simply because it is absorbed and added to the serum concentration. That is a straw man. Dietary cholesterol is proposed to raise serum LDL in good part because it alters hepatic circulation of LDL, meaning that less serum LDL is cleared by the liver, meaning that endogenously produced cholesterol builds up in the blood:“Once LDL receptors become saturated, the removal rate of LDL is proportional to the number of receptors. Whenever the number of receptors is reduced, plasma LDL levels must rise. Experiments in animals indicate that the consumption of a high fat diet decreases the number of LDL receptors in the liver (123, 124). We believe that this mechanism operates through feedback suppression as described above. That is, when excess dietary cholesterol accumulates in the liver, the liver responds by decreasing the production of LDL receptors (Fig. 13C). The entry of dietary cholesterol into the liver is mediated by a receptor, termed the chylomicron remnant receptor, whose activity is genetically distinct from the LDL receptor (125). The chylomicron remnant receptor is unaffected by cholesterol accumulation (126), and it causes cholesterol to accumulate to high levels in the liver when the diet contains excess fat.The combination of saturation and suppression of hepatic LDL receptors contributes in a major way to the buildup of LDL in plasma when a diet rich in saturated fats and cholesterol is ingested. Insofar as such a diet also may increase production of LDL in the face of a fixed or declining removal capacity, the LDL level would rise even higher.”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3513311Given that the work toward illuminating this kind of mechanistic pathway was awarded a Nobel Prize, I find your apparent ignorance of it quite baffling.There is also of course the empirical evidence that dietary cholesterol raises serum cholesterol, and a likely explanation why some schools of public health and NGOs don’t think it raises serum cholesterol very much is because they are looking at extant variation in a population that already has elevated cholesterol as a result of diet, and forgetting that there is a regime of diminishing marginal effect:http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/55/6/1060.long“Eggs are not dangerous and do not promote diabetes.”If your statement to the effect that dietary cholesterol cannot effect serum cholesterol levels very much is based on a tacit admission that raised LDL is generally a bad thing, then the paper cited above also challenges your beliefs about the non-harmfulness of eggs. Egg yolk feeding was the source of dietary cholesterol in many of the controlled feeding studies used at the base of Hopkins’ meta-analysis.Great post! Thanks for your well thought out and evidence based contributions.Miranda: Sadly these posters cannot listen. And apparently with that mind set, they feel free to imply that since your thinking is not what they call mainstream with respect to cholesterol etc. that you may not have the credentials you claim to. (Where have I heard that before?!) If Dr. Gregor says it, it has to be true. If a non vegan or anyone else with a different view says it, it has to be false. Regardless of their knowledge or credentials.Thank you for your post. I think you need fiber to feel full. I think your body really counts fiber. Really fills you up. Maybe without fiber a person really is starving!“Meta-analysis’ [sic] are also disproving the AMA’s (American Heart Association) guidelines. From March 2014 in the Annal of Internal Medicine: Association of Dietary, Circulating, and Supplement Fatty Acids with Coronary Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: http://annals.org/mobile/artic… reviewed 49 observational studies and 27 randomized controlled trials concluded “Current evidence does not Cleary support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of poly-unsaturated fats and low consumption of total saturated fats.”Plant Positive gave a brief response to this particular meta-analysis: http://plantpositive.com/blog/2014/3/23/recent-articles-by-drs-chowdhury-and-dinicolantonio.htmlhealthy-longevity, another blogger in a similar genre to Plant Positive, covered the study more extensively: http://healthylongevity.blogspot.com/2014/03/saturated-fat-heart-disease-meta-analysis.htmlHis language is a bit more tortuous and his work is a bit dryer, but his quantitative analysis is generally more sophisticated than that of PP.If only I had a nickel every time Toxins and Thea shoot down paleo-ish posts from “licensed nutritionists” (I’ve heard of Registered Dietitians or RDN’s, not aware of any ‘nutritionist’ license) and refer the readers to http://plantpositive.com/ . . . (see below) . . .Fear not, it is a real license issued by my state. http://mn.gov/health-licensing-boards/dietetics-and-nutrition/applicants/applicationnutritionist.jspMIranda, are you actually suggesting the flake-fest healthimpactnews.com you linked to (which is a cover for a nut-job religious fundamentalist) is a source that anyone should pay any attention to? Regardless of the license application form you linked to and whether you have any credentials or not, you’re not helping your case by citing the previous Sweden example. The guy who writes that ENTIRE site has a BA in Bible studies and an MA in linguistics. Puhleez. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but the study he cites is from another paleo-promo Swedish blog.Okay, I apologize for that. I was searching for the information to show that it was adopted in Sweden and typing this up at work, so my time was limited. I don’t always like healthimpactnews.com either. Here are some other sources to refer to instead about Sweden adopting the high fat diets:http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diet/low-carb-high-fat-diet.html http://journals.lww.com/nutritiontodayonline/Abstract/2014/05000/The_Swedish_Review,__Dietary_Treatment_of.7.aspx http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/news/20140916/high-fat-dairy-diabetesBut the Scandinavian countries doesn’t have any stellar numbers in hearth disease and cancer. And also what’s new? Sweden eating few vegetables, grains and legumes..? It was always like that. Their statistics will keep as bad as they always were.The ideology recently changed about 6 months ago. It would make sense for a country to choose support what would be healthiest for it’s citizens, but it can’t force people to eat that way.I had thought that the Sweds have a very Western like diet and drink fruit juice as a health choice. The Western diet is taking over the world! Is this a good thing? Yes, more of the world is now obese than starving and more people live in suburbia than in rural areas. Many less people are hungry than before and people have more wealth. I think people on Western diets, offered healthy information, make healthier choices than people who are poor and not offered health choices. Giving people options I think is actually good for right now for life extension. In Dr. Greger’s cited example of vegetarians of Uganda, he showed that their diet of only vegetables and roots, the people didn’t have a single case of heart disease. However, as a country, they currently have a median life expectancy of only about 55 in Uganda. The doctor who described and used this diet lived to 93. Using the plant based diet as prevention could combine both life styles. I think fast-food mostly makes money selling french fries and salad and really only makes money selling ice cream. I would like to acknowledge my mom for her deep devotion to life, oh, that the Earth loves the wealth of plants. As the western diet spreads, there is going to be more heart disease and obesity related death. The plant based diet here can help. Just one bottle of fenugreek spice could help many Americans lose five pounds with a small amount of exercise.is saturated fat from plants anything to worry about? i eat a lot of nuts and seeds this time of year. I’ve never actually seen anything that specifically says all saturated fat is bad, just that of animal origin.Hi justin, Check out these videos from William Harris, M.D. long-time vegan doctor and co-founder of the Veg. Society of Hawaii. I think you will find ample discussion of whole-food plant fats that will help you make an informed decision about your diet choices. http://www.vegsource.com/harris/My%20Videos.htmDr. Greger: Can you review the research studies (many of which were done in Europe) cited by Dr. William Li MD who says that hard cheese particularly Gouda, Edam, Emmenthal and Jarlsburg prevents cancer and atherosclerosis.Contributor: William Li MDDr. William Li is President, Medical Director, and Co-founder of the Angiogenesis Foundation, and is a highly-sought international lecturer, advisor, and Fortune 500 consultant for his predictive insights into medical breakthroughs. –The following information is stated on his web site.“The Surprising Truth about Cancer, and an Arsenal of Weapons to Fight ItA Surprising WeaponBut this arsenal also contains surprising weapons. Here is one: Cheese.Eating certain types of hard cheeses, including Gouda, Edam, Emmenthal, and Jarlsburg, can lower your risk of developing cancer. Why? Because these cheeses contain a form of Vitamin K called Vitamin K2 (the scientific name is menaquinone) that is both antiangiogenic and also kills cancer cells directly. The studies indicate that eating as few as two slices of these hard cheeses a day can lower your overall risk for cancer, including lung cancer and prostate cancer. You can find these cheeses in your local grocery store.You might be wondering whether eating cheese frequently is such a good idea? Well, in this case, it turns out that vitamin K2 also protects the heart by preventing hardening of the arteries. Many of the medical studies I’ve cited were done in Europe where cheese is regularly eaten, even on a daily basis, including breakfast. Personally, I think the research is so compelling that we should all find ways to add vitamin K2 into our diets. If you are a cheese lover, Gouda and the other types I listed above are good choices. For people who are lactose intolerant or who just don’t like dairy, chicken is another good source of Vitamin K2. Not the whole chicken, but the dark meat like the thighs and drumsticks. There many tasty chicken recipes that let you substitute dark meat for white breast meat.” – See more at: http://www.eattobeat.org/frontlines/3/the-surprising-truth-about-cancer-and-an-arsenal-of-weapons-to-fight-it.html#sthash.nimh5Ikj.dpufThere are much better/healthier sources of non-animal, cruelty free, environmentally responsible vitamin K, e.g. kale, spinach, Swiss chard, mustard greens, parsley, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, avocado and my fave, the culturally popular/unpopular natto! http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10874601 Available frozen in most Asian grocery stores, throw the sauce packets away (never mind the ingredients listing the soy beans are always plain and those scary ingredients are only in the flavor packs) and use your own soy sauce, mustard, miso, ketchup etc.My takeaway from this video comes from the Harika paper. Bangladesh had the lowest fat intake (11.1%) of 40 countries. Judicious ‘modernization’ of their diet plan to improve micro-nutrient intake seems like a good target to shoot for to lower total fat intake while maintaining a well-planned WFPB diet. Here’s a look at what they eat in Bangladesh: http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ag126e/AG126E05.htmAs for the claims that some people cannot thrive on a WFPB diet, Dr. Michael Klaper, M.D. has some interesting thoughts on this topic that I (a layperson) find thought-provoking and probably correct: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tJyb1wTxg4The facts that someone has an interest doesn’t mean he is wrong… I prefer more scientific arguments.Latest from PCRM:Low-Carb Dieting Takes Another BlowPeople who consume more whole grains live longer, according to a new study from Harvard. Researchers analyzed the diets and mortality of more than 118,000 men and women from both the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and found that, after an average of 25 years follow-up, more whole-grain intake was associated with lower death rates and that every whole-grain serving was associated with a 5 percent lower risk for death in general and a 9 percent lower risk for death from heart disease. Whole grains, for this study, were defined as the whole grain (whole wheat, oats, brown rice, etc.) as well as its pulverized flour form (whole-wheat flour, oat flour, brown rice flour, etc.), which may be found in products such as breads and cereals. The benefits were independent of other lifestyle factors, including exercise and other dietary choices.These findings support other studies (see https://pcrm.org/health/medNews/low-carb-diets-increase-heart-disease-risk) that show avoiding healthful carbs and consuming more animal products increases the risk for dying.Wu H, Flint AJ, Qi Q, et al. Association between dietary whole grain intake and risk of mortality: two large prospective studies in us men and women. JAMA Intern Med. Published online January 5, 2015. http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2087877Margarine is a plant-based food, it contains plant oils. However, it has trans fats, it is a trans fat derived product. Is Margarine, with its trans-fats, healthier than butter with its cholesterol and saturated fat? Margarine may soon be banned by the FDA, or at least is now in a nebulous category as a food that uses trans fats that cannot be served in the restaurants. Perhaps you could use extra virgin olive oil as a spread or shortening, which is slightly recommended by Dr. Greger. It is not a matter of which is healthier for you, butter or margarine, but which is worse. The saturated fat in butter and its cholesterol raise LDL, the trans-fat in margarine very much hardens arteries. Maybe even peanut butter should be your spread. Maybe there is no healthy fat except for that which naturally occurs in some plant foods.Mathew: re: “Margarine is a plant-based food, it contains plant oils. However, it has trans fats…” This is true of traditional margarines. However, in the past few years, a couple companies have come out with plant based margarines that are free of trans fats. Two American brands are: Smart Balance and Earth Balance.As you noted, it is still not very healthy. However, if you are indulging in a special treat, like a favorite dessert for a birthday or something, and you need to use margarine, there is definitely the option of a a plant based margarine that does not have trans fats.Just a thought for you.Thank you! I like your comment. Do you think canola or rape seed oil is healthy? It is said the healthiest oils are olive, sunflower, and canola. Maybe non of them are healthy compared to what you can find in a sheet of Nori and flax seed meal. Patiently, olive oil is neutral or only slightly recommended here. This site recommends a very low fat and very low saturated fat diet with nuts and seeds as a treat. This is very much the opposite of many fad diets! (Low gluten high Adkins). I think this site would more recommend oatmeal, and whole grain rice than lean ham and a cut of steak.Oil despite its plant origin is not healthy. If one wanted to use a little oil for some reason canola sounds like a good mix of fats but its chemical extraction and processing makes it very unhealthy.Mathew: re: ” Do you think canola or rape seed oil is healthy?” I don’t think *any* oil is healthy. Period. In fact, I think oil is less healthy than sugar. But even though I don’t think sugar is all that healthy, I still eat it. (More than I should!) I look on oil the same way. It’s not healthy. But as a rare treat in the context of a very healthy diet (that normally doesn’t have any oil), it shouldn’t be a problem.To understand why no oils are healthy, I *highly* recommend the following talk by Jeff Novick: From Oil To Nuts. I’ve watched this talk multiple times and keep picking up new info. And I’ve shown it to many family and friends: http://www.amazon.com/Oil-Nuts-Essential-Facts-Oils/dp/B003UYAQIY/ref=sr_1_1_twi_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420838132&sr=8-1&keywords=from+oil+to+nuts+jeffHere is a free excerpt from the talk where Jeff compares oil to sugar. If you like this bit, you will love the whole talk. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbALgjmZUekAll that said, if I had to pick an oil to use in a recipe, I would pick say canola oil over olive. You will find out why in Jeff’s talk. :-)What do I say to ppl who recommend a high fat diet or paleo? Why is 80/10/10 best diet? Any evidence?Hi Derrek this website is full of videos that support a plant based diet. Under each video there is a sources cited area. All research will be the evidence you request.In the acknowledgement of the referenced article by Aranceta and Perez-Rodrigo we find the following statement: “The preparatory meetings for this series of reviews on fat and health were funded by Puleva Food. Neither Javier Aranceta nor Carmen Pe´rez-Rodrigo have conﬂicts of interest to disclosure” (the grammar mistake is theirs). The website of Puleva Food identifies a company producing a large variety of milk with various supplements. No conflict of interest???Off topic: I’m curious what your position is on fasting?I know you are not polling me, but Dr. Greger has a video on how a restricted calorie diet can add many years to your life. “Eat until you are eight tenths full,” is a common expression among some 100 year old cultures. You could also eat peanuts, whole grains, green tea, or spinach, for a similar benefit. I thinking fasting has many definitions. Some go without eating meat once a week or for 40 days in lent (Cathloics), or do not eat for two meals in a row (Mormons) some go without eating for 24 hours once a year (Jewish peoples) or more often, the most extreme people, the orthodox do not eat meat or milk most of the year on any Saint Days. Being mostly Vegan, these people should have many heart benefits. The people of India are mostly vegetarian but they do not consider themselves to always be fasting, Hindu people will never eat the cow, as it is Devine to them. Fasting is healthy. Christ said to not show off your fast, although the religions and the religious leaders sure should. Christ knew many people fasted, at least then. I think all the vegetarians and vegans here are to be complemented on their fast and thanked for allowing us to benefit from reading their writing as it adds to our lives. I am hoping to share in their diet for the health benefits, learning from such heart healthy people. I sure wish I had the will power to fast like that. http://lds.about.com/od/basicsgospelprinciples/f/fasting.htmI’m happy to get useful information from anyone, so thank you :) I was thinking of people who promote not eating any food for one or more days, e.g. once a week. I’m not interested in the “weight loss benefits” as I am already on a WFPB diet, so I’m lean by definition ;) So my question is should I consider fasting as a way of increasing my health?Off topic: The video http://nutritionfacts.org/video/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/ seems to cut off before it is finished.The only thing that worries me why so many vegans (especially raw ones) end up having health problems? it doesn’t make sense. For example, maybe you have heard of Victoria Boutenko (author of ’12 Steps to Raw Foods’ and other books) and her family. Not long ago she admitted to eating eggs and fish because of health problems after being vegan for 10 years..Maybe our optimal diet should be patterned after that of chimps (our closest DNA relative from mammals and primates) or something like that?I’ve recently watched a few documentories about their life. They are about 90% vegan. But they hunt other species (including other monkeys) and eat eggs and insects too though they have plenty of plant foods choices around. Doesn’t that mean that if animal foods were the root of all evil chimps and baboons would instinctively avoid it? The Mother Nature always proves to be wise so there must be an explanation to that.There is a big problem with a 100% raw food diet. The body needs nutrients that are not bio-available from raw food. Legumes and grains need to be well cooked. These are very important for good health. Perhaps someone will direct you to videos that explain the matter better.“The only thing that worries me why so many vegans (especially raw ones) end up having health problems?”One might speculate. For one, anecdotal evidence is not really that good and can give you a distorted picture of the world even when the cases are true. Many people will be keen to report on people who report that they abandoned a vegan diet for health reasons, regardless of whether those health reasons are solid and solidly connected with veganism. The story feeds other dietary ideologies.Raw foodism is highly restrictive, and as far as I know is not really based on sound science when rejecting cooking. It’s harder to implement healthfully and it is attractive to some people who perhaps are not so great at implementing it, or so attracted to restricted diets in itself that they do other weird things. Some few people may have food intolerances of the sort that they have problems when their grocery store becomes effectively limited to a few fruits. Veganism itself won’t work if you don’t have half a brain; you can’t get your B12 from a feeling of smug superiority or a dogmatic dietary ideology.“Doesn’t that mean that if animal foods were the root of all evil chimps and baboons would instinctively avoid it? The Mother Nature always proves to be wise so there must be an explanation to that.”This is dichotomous reasoning. Animal foods aren’t the root of all evil but there aren’t particularly good reasons to consume significant quantities of most animal foods. I don’t know why you think Mother Nature is always wise. Baboons will instinctively try to eat the Western diet of junk food when they get the chance, just as bears are known to seek out campers’ food once they have tasted it and know what its all about. Humans instinctively seek out a diet of junk foods too because they are calorie dense. It’s not good for us as modern people with an abundance of high-calorie nutrient-deficient junk, but it would have been good for fitness in an environment where the chief dietary barriers to reproduction were things like starvation before sexual maturity.Maybe it’s better to eat 5-10% energy from select animal foods such as insects or mussels, but there’s really not much systematic evidence in favor of this idea — and in some important ways, it’s much easier to work out a basic pattern for home cooking that has 0% animal food. AND, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, which is often charged with bias in its curriculum due to food industry influence, has nonetheless stated clearly that well-planned vegan diets are not deficient for any stage of the life cycle: http://www.eatright.org/About/Content.aspx?id=8357Was there a link between the actual study mentioned at the beginning and the dairy industry?How would you respond to people who think organic, free range eggs and organic meat is healthy? Then they use a source like this: http://rawfoodsos.com/2010/07/07/the-china-study-fact-or-fallac/ to try to debunk The China Study. And they don’t believe cholesterol causes heart disease. Here’s there source they use: http://chriskresser.com/cholesterol-doesnt-cause-heart-diseasePlease reconcile your work with Gary Taubes’ work. You guys should be forced into a room together until a consensus is reached for the sake of the public.Yvan: If you are dealing with someone who intellectually dishonest, it would not be possible to come to a consensus. If you are interested in a discussion that directly addresses Taubes’ “work”, I highly recommend taking a peak at Plant Positive’s work. All of his videos really address Taubes directly or indirectly. But here are 50 videos that mention him by name: http://plantpositive.com/display/Search?moduleId=19496100&searchQuery=gary+taubesThe Plant Positive videos are not only interesting, but entertaining.Given that many self-described vegans try to be careful to not become Omega 6/3 unbalanced, but that most nuts (Almonds, Peanuts,) and Avocados are very High in Omega 6s — How can vegans, especially their children growing up, be assured — they are getting enough FAT in their diets, and converting ALA to EPA & DHA — Without maxing out on Omega 6s (Inflammatories)? In other words, if we want to avoid avocados, peanuts, and nuts, to avoid very high Omega 6 imbalance to 3s, as most plant-based researchers now recommend — then where do plant-based children need to get their fat? How much fat do children need for DHA and brain growth and function? The corollary question is therefore: Does ALA convert at a much higher rate to EPA & DHA, once on a plant-based 1:1 Omega 6:3 balance diet? Some studies show yes, other studies point to – no? But who knows who’s eating ‘oil’ on these studies? Because, being vegan, doesn’t mean they don’t consume vegetable oils – which is the No. 1 offender for Omega 6:3 imbalance. What’s a plant-based parent to do, but worry about developing brains? Thank you!Thanks for reposting this question. I think even though some of those foods you mentioned have more omega-6’s they do not take into account the entire daily diet. For example, once beans, whole grains, and tons of fruits and veggies come into play the ratio of fats balance out a bit. Their are many conversion factors and I think to be safe taking a DHA/EPA supplement is best if that is a concern. Note that children are a different ball game. They certainly need that fat and energy to grow if they are following a vegan diet. The best place for info on kids is perhaps the Vegetarian Nutrition dietetic practice group and the Vegetarian Resource Group.You ask extremely important questions. i am going to make a Ask the Dietitian Q&A about this and post soon. In the meantime. See these links for more info. Vegetarian Resource Group.Some vegetable oils like canola and flax have a good ratio of essential fats. More to come…Thanks, JosephI understand that saturated fat from animals is bad. Is the saturated fat from organic cold-pressed, unrefined coconut oil as bad as the saturated fat from animals? I’ve read that saturated fat has some beneficial effects.Hi pat thanks so much for reposting this question. Dr. Greger points out the differences in this video. From the transcript “Unlike saturated animal fats, coconut oil doesn’t cause that spike inflammation immediately after consumption of animal foods, which makes sense because as you’ll remember it may be the dead bacterial endotoxins in animal products ferried into the body by saturated fat that are to blame. ”I am not sure of the benefits from saturated fats. Feel free to post any studies here to support that claim and we can look and see why the researchers came to that conclusion. Here is more info on saturated fat, if interested. Thanks again for your post!JosephDr. Greger! There’s been a few articles floating around the uk at the moment in regards to this ‘study’ http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-09/d-ssc091214.php that suggests, ” in contrast to animal fats in general, fats specific to dairy products may have a role in prevention of type 2 diabetes.” ?!?! Would it be possible to have some light shed on this? Or maybe you could point me towards a video you have already done on this. Surely this study is misleading…. dairy preventing type 2 diabetes?!Hi t1planteater. Thanks for the review of the study would be to read it in full. I wonder if they looked at lipids, heart disease risk, or what kind of diet people in the intervention consumed? Just last week a study came out showing high amounts of dairy products increases risk of advanced prostate cancer. We have so many videos on dairy. Also, Dr. Forrester’s thoughts on diabetes. See if any of these help?You didn’t provide evidence that saturated fat is bad. And if that evidence is merely that it raises cholesterol, then please provide evidence that this is bad.

Are there solvents involved ?It depends on the process. Swiss water process or Mexican water process uses only water if I understand correctly.Thanks for the reply.Doesn’t decaffienation remove antioxidants? Not that it is a big deal if you eat your fruit & veg anyway.Buy Swiss Water processed coffee. It is a patented process that uses only water to remove caffeine. No chemicals whatsoever. Also another side benefit is that SWP Decafs generally indistinguishable taste-wise from caffeinated coffee. Grocery store decafs will be almost certainly be chemically processed using a benzene like fluid (dry cleaning fluid). I buy mine online here (look for the green logo with “SWP” : http://www.toomerscoffee.com/buy-toomers-coffee/Great topic. And timely for me. I just read in Dr. Neal Barnard’s book that he feels that tea consumption should be limited due to “significant” levels of aluminum in tea. I know that that there are different beliefs on this, but Dr. Neal Barnard is highly regarded in this community, as well as amongst many other vegans I know.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-there-too-much-aluminum-in-tea/Yes, I’ve watched this video before, and took it into consideration. But I also take into consideration the fact that not all people excrete/eliminate things as effectively as others, and that so many diets out there are dense in fat, primarily saturated fats, and these fats might somehow increase intestinal permeability, allowing aluminum into areas of the body where it does not belong, before the GI tract/organs have even had a chance to eliminate the aluminum. For Dr. Barnard to state his message so clearly, it is enough to make me pause and consider that there are many different views, and that maybe tea is simply not for everyone (as far as aluminum safety).Hi Elsie – I’m not from the medical profession so I wouldn’t know – just thought the video would be of use.ChrisA study in Japan found that drinking green tea is a factor in Asian longevity and that each daily cup of green tea can add a year to your life. Those drinking five cups gained five years, living to 80, those drinking ten cups lived to 85 years, gaining 10 years. There was more of a benefit for women than men. Can you imagine drinking five or even ten cups of matcha a day? This site seems to recommend 7-10 cups of tea a day, and matcha as well. Do you think that tea limits you to ten years beyond average? This would be about one to two standard deviations above normal for Japan. Many of the doctors described here who are vegans live to 93 or later. How do you think you could gain two or even three standard deviations of years to your life, knowing that 70 percent of lifespan could be implied to be environmental? By eating a plant based diet, not smoking, getting exercise, and staying trim. Perhaps by eating the healthiest foods and dosing antioxidant rich foods throughout the day and maintaining a healthy mood we could get to 93. Demographers today believe that the average Australian girl born today will live to 100. There is a way to make that true for you too, we think it is beans, nuts dark chocolate, green tea, whole grains, berries, fresh fruits and vegetables. We think the famous cultures of 100 year olds have some common characteristics. Not eating meat, drinking light alcohol, lots of fresh vegetables and fruits, light fish consumption, and eating less are all common traits. Perhaps its simpler, perhaps they all eat peanuts. Perhaps beans could be more powerful than that. Picking carefully among these fruits and vegetables, as this site makes possible, could extend longevity and reduce health burden.Just let me know as soon as you have the answer…….If the largest study of it’s kind, Harvard researchers found that nuts make you immortal. In all seriousness, eating a walnut a day could add ten years to your life, which in addition to green tea, could profoundly add to life. The benefits of walnuts mean that they should be in every diet. Some people were recommended a 1/4 cups of nuts a day. The benefit of nuts was so profound, some people think maybe three hand fulls of nuts a day would be better. Lora Dunning researchers found people who replace 200 calories with 14 macadamia nuts lived longer and better. There were similar results with pistachios and peanuts. Whole grains were just as protective. Dr. Greger said that eating four bowls of oatmeal a day could dramatically improve your lifespan. The only thing more effective than nuts is beans. Even string beans or peas should be in a daily diet. Black beans really add to life. Peanuts are a nuts and a bean, maybe they add life to all who eat them daily, knowing that people think of them as an indulgence. Those who see them as the spartan item they are, and eat them with others live longer (like those who eat peanut butter, much longer lived people). Dark Chocolate also virtually destroys your ability to get heart disease. I think the only problem with nuts and dark chocolate is trying to manage the saturated fat. Beans, nuts, whole grain, green tea, dark chocolate, berries, fresh fruits, and vegetables can glean live for all cost effectively.English walnuts being the best variety for fighting cancer – http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/I eat all the supposedly heart attack proof foods. Still had a heart attack and heart disease in my late 40’s. There just aren’t any guarantees in life.I am so sorry to hear about your heart disease. Thank you very much for eating all the heart healthy foods. They perhaps made your heart attack more survivable. If eating beans cuts your risk of heart disease in half, if drinking tea cuts your risk of heart disease in half, if eating nuts cuts your risk of heart disease in half, if eating whole grains cuts your heart disease risk in half, if taking an aspiring a day cuts your risk of heart disease in half, if drinking one drink a day cuts your heart disease risk in half, does that mean if you do all of them you have 1/64 the risk of heart disease? Add dark chocolate for 1/128 the risk? Add kiwi for 1/256 the risk? Add exercise for 1/512 the risk? Apparently it does not because there are no guarantees in life, as you say. However, there are superfoods that can add to the benefits of the food you already eat. Foods like green tea, mushrooms, black raspberries, nori seaweed, walnuts, black beans, peanuts, sweet potatoes or pumpkins, garlic, broccoli, and others that can bind in health benefits. Dr. Greger said that you can be 14 years younger on the plant based diet, exercise, losing weight, and not smoking. He said some Vegan men have had their semen tested at more than 30 years younger! Beans, nuts, dark chocolate, whole grains, berries, fresh fruit, and fresh veggies can add to heart disease survivability. For heart disease, this site recommends nuts, whole grain, beans, cocoa, exercise, and fresh vegetables like garlic and fruit like apples.Sounds so great but how did they know when they would have died without the tea? They did not of course…They did not know that they would have died earlier without the tea. The idea is that tea fights inflammation, oxidation, wear and tear, dilation, clogging. diffusion, inconstancy, erratic changes, uneven pathways, stress, damage, missing chunks. nerve movement, and pain. The more of it you drink the more it reduces damage inside of you, the more it keeps you whole. Perhaps friends have commented on feeling fitter after eating some nuts or drinking some tea. This benefit really adds up, as opposed to letting medicine really break down when people are sick to let them get better. Is that an okay paradigm for medicine? To let the fittest survive, to let those invest the most in their health stay the fittest? The economics of medicine. I think doctors have to treat all patients the same but they should be very diligent in telling everyone to try to prevent all disease with the most plant based diet, exercise, not smoking, and losing weight. Drinking more tea, eating more beans, and eating more nuts based on how you feel can dictate your health. As you say, people don’t age without some sort of stressor and that stressor isn’t always time or space, but all people can respond to it to prevent disease with adaptogenic (stress relieving) plants like tea, nuts, beans, whole grains, berries, fresh fruit, and vegetables.Do you know if Green Rooibos Tea (Aspalanthus linearis) has the same health benefits as Green Tea? It is unfermented and very palatable whereas I don’t enjoy Green Tea.Hello, Dr. Greger highly recommends Rooibos tea on this site, saying it is “wonderful stuff.” It has many of the same health benefits and none of the caffeine as green tea. It has anti-aging, anti-oxidant, and heart health properties superior to green tea. I have read that green Rooibos tea has many times as many antioxidants as you’d need in a day. You could certainly drink it instead of green tea. It is a delicacy in Japan. I actually think we should campaign for green rooibos matcha, Green rooibos is a bean and a tea, making it an ideal health drink. Rooibos tea is relatively new to the health sciences so long term benefit is difficult to assess or unknown. Perhaps it will take many years to show that green rooibos is better for you then green tea, but for now it is just as healthy. Drink 5 to 10 cups a day instead of any other beverage you’d like as you wish.According to this site, green rooibos has 100 times the antioxidants you’d need in a day. http://turtlewoman.hubpages.com/hub/Rooibos-tea-health-benefits-lose-weight-and-cure-insomnia-naturallyThank you for the information. I bought some from Mtn Rose Herbs but had forgotten about it. It will be a great warm drink for the winter.Where do I find de-alcoholed wine?? HahaGrape juice..Hi Elsie, did he mention what the limit should be?Dr. G covered this interesting topic here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mB4j5Iof0c His analysis comes out pretty much “no worries”He simply stated to “minimize the use of tea.”I’ll be offline for the rest of today, so if anyone replies I won’t be returning until to this post until maybe sometime later this weekend.Another issue with tea is fluoride, which can cause all sorts of problems in the body, depending on the individual, and depending on buffers such as milk. Pineal gland, thyroid, and kidneys are at special risk, from my last research on the topic.In know that this is really off-topic, but I invented my best friends for a christmas dinner at my new place, and almost all of then are meat-eaters. So, I wanna make a great a delicious dinner with only whole plant food for convincing that it’s delicious eating this way. Anyone have a secret recipe that can share with me?Cheater Pad Thai is fabulous: http://www.thechinastudy.com/endorsed-by-t-colin-campbell/happy-herbivore-series/recipes/hmm… sounds great! I will make one this week to give it a try :)yes. I advise you do all that and also have a barbie in the back making the flesh crispy on the outside and tender on the in so they can eat what they feel they need, and puruse the other delectables. deny them the meat and they wil feel slighted and hungry and in the end annoyed or angry you fed everyone else and left thme judged and starved and shamed since they do not even merit consideration in your mind. Like a christian who makes like they accept you though you think you have the truth they do not, pretends to be friends just to convert them. Seems manipulative and passive aggressive and unfriendly. I’m a grain free vegan and my meat eating friends LOVE everything I make, but they want it with meat because that’s how they feel fed. And they always think of the health benefits eating from less meat, and get to contemplate how awesome all the other food there is to eat is. . . . my 2 cents.My friends and relative know that I do not use meat and if they want it they are welcome to bring their own already cooked. Just as I take my beans to their gatherings. No problem.As JJ said, I also told them that they can bring their own food if they want. In my house I don´t cook meat (not only because of human health issues, but also because of the environmental situation of our great home (planet Earth).Hello Filipe, Chef AJ has a video of holiday dishes to make that are delicious, eye-appealing, and tasty to omnivores. Her hearty lentil loaf is great! Below the video, click on “show more” where the notes are to see the recipes printed out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHqKMY8mf4kAnother idea that is easy to prepare is to use Butler soy curls. http://www.butlerfoods.com/products/soycurls.html I rehydrated and cooked them in veggie broth with some herbs and diced onions. Then add favorite barbeque sauce and you’re done. They look and smell like pulled pork or chicken. Serve on a bun with some cole slaw and everyone will be happy. I made these for my daughter’s new Texas relatives at her wedding and they were a big hit. Great prepared and served in a crock pot for a low-stress holiday buffet. Good luck!P.S. Yes, we also love Cheater Pad Thai mentioned by Mike S. Make the sauce and add lots of veggies, such as bok choy, broccoli, cabbage, bean sprouts. Squeeze lime juice on top when all is assembled. I serve this over plain brown rice instead of rice noodles; filling and easy to prepare.Sounds great!I agree with Sunshine and Thea, a lentil loaf is a great idea. My personal favorite is Dreena Burton’s. There are lots of ingredients but most are seasonings and it comes together pretty quick and easy in one pot.http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2012/04/dreenas-no-fu-love-loaf.htmlI made fatfreevegan’s Mushroom Seitan Roast for thanksgiving, and while it’s a great recipe and I would highly recommend it, at the dinner table to be honest I kind of ignored it, as I was much happier to fill up on all of the sides. I had mashed white potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, a side roll, mixed sauteed veggies, corn, all topped with delicious and super easy blended bean gravy:http://glutenfreevegan.me/savory-white-bean-gravy/People love starch! Fill em with starch and you’re off to a good start. For another “entree” style recipe, Isa Chandra’s lentil stuffing burgers are another favorite of mine. Instead of eating them as burgers, I prefer to eat them on their own as patties with gravy, mashed potatoes, etc. Personally I omit the oil, use commercial bagged bread cubes (which I believe prevented the sogginess issues some of the commenters had) and use walnuts instead of hazelnuts.http://www.theppk.com/2013/11/stuffed-thanksgiving-burger/Good luck! I’m sure whatever you end up making it will be delicious. Have a great holiday :)Thank you b00mer! I will take a look at your options. After the fest session, I will try to tell you what was my options and the results.b00mer: Thank YOU for this post! I have made a bunch of recipes from Let Them Eat Vegan. That book is on my short list of go-to books. So, I’ll have to look up the no-fu loaf. Also, thanks for the stuffing burger link. Looks really, really good.So many recipes to try! So few meals in a lifetime!Sunshine99: I made that lentil loaf for Thanksgiving and it went over really great. I made it in a bundt pan which gave it a great shape. And then I used a cranberry-balsalmic glaze to put in the center and dribble on top that I got from a different site.Filipe: I also suggest recipes from the following book if you can get your hands on a copy: http://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Holidays-Celebration-Thanksgiving-Through/dp/1570672849/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1418426538&sr=1-5&keywords=vegan+holiday+cookingI haven’t made recipes from the Christmas chapter, but I’ve made several other recipes in the book and they almost always come out perfect – with great taste, texture and presentation. I make those recipes outside of holidays too, I like them so much. The main drawback to this book is that those recipes are bit more involved than some people may want to do. But I think : hey, this is for special holiday cooking. So, a few more ingredients and effort are called for to make it special. (That’s just my approach. Of course, holiday cooking does not have to involve more effort.)Good luck. I hope your event goes off great!Thea, love the bundt pan idea for the loaf! While I don’t have a regular sized one, you’ve reminded me that I happen to have a mini bundt pan that makes little cupcake sized bundt shapes (have never used it, lol!), which I think could make some pretty adorable little loaves. Might have to try that. Also the cranberry balsamic glaze idea. Have bookmarked a recipe for one to try out next week.Also thank you for sharing that cookbook link. From the few recipes I could view, the Garlicky Chestnut Butter is definitely calling my name! I made regular cranberry sauce for thanksgiving, and the Cranberry Pear Compote sounds like a nice change of pace to try for Christmas. Whether I pick up the book or not I think I’ll try those out next week as well.b00mer: I can’t take credit for the bundt pan idea. Chef AJ suggested it in her Unprocessed cookbook. I have a big silicon one with ridges, and it really did work great and look fancy. I think mini-ones would be very cute, though. No reason not to give that a try.I really like this thread/exchanging ideas for holiday cooking. It sure can help when you want to try to impress more “traditional” (?less sophisticated) pallets.The book is a real winner. I have *lots* of cookbooks, but only a few that I would really praise highly. If you end up making some recipes from that book, I would be interested in knowing how it goes. There is a recipe in the book for a savory yule lot made of chickpeas if I remember correctly. But there is no picture. I’m really interested to hear from someone who makes it.Moosewood vegetable tofu lasagna. Get the new Moosewood cookbook at the library. Takes about an hour to make even non vegans like it. DELICIOUS!Google Vegan Black Metal ChefThat’s not whole food vegan.Yeah, I agree his stuff isn’t all healthy. I don’t cook it that often.But if you know someone who has a palate accustomed to salt, sugar and fat his stuff usually works.most of my non-whole food friends tend to think the stuff I regularly eat is bland… I think there is room for compromise when cooking for other people. I consider it gateway food to a better diet.Lots of yummy vegan recipes here, including a winner soy whipped cream (really delicious!) http://www.godslastwarning.comDe-alcoholized wine sounds terrible!Isn’t this what you’d have when using it in cooking? I’m pretty sure the alcohol evaporates upon serious heating.Not even at high temperature, it seems it does evaporate around 80°C~Surface temps achieved with a pan on the stovetop are much greater than 80 C.no doubtThis is very confusing. One study shows we should filter coffee to remove the negative effects on cholesterol levels. (Should this matter if cholesterol is below 150?) The next study shows a negative effect of coffee on endothelial dialation. The next study contradicts that one by suggesting that drinking some of the grinds (which is what we’ve filtered out in the first study right?) offers benefits to endothelial functioning. So, those studies contradict each other, no? The next study suggests caffeine helps heart function. (The coffee in that test evidently didn’t have the non-caffeine elements of whole coffee right?) A final study on coffee suggests it impedes blood flow to the heart. So, I guess given the contradictory information, it’s best to drink tea.Would using some soy milk in coffee be considered a creamer?Just drink water. Simplify your life.Tea is in the clear, too!This is a link –> A cup of Joe has many benefitsI`m in!Thanks for this summary, Tobias, to which I’d add research on longevity. As the Mayo Clinic, e.g., summarizes the research: “most studies find an association between coffee consumption and decreased overall mortality and possibly cardiovascular mortality,” which raises questions about the meaningful effects of coffee on endothelial function found in the research cited in this video. Dr. Gregor?Having no idea what “Greek coffee” was, I did a little research and found out that it is actually Turkish coffee, artificially renamed for political reasons. ( Just like “freedom fries” are actually French fries )Great video. The mention of aluminum below does intrigue me, especially the discussion of intestinal wall permeability. As a raw foods vegan, I have given thought to intestinal wall health; i.e., is the intestinal tissue enhanced, as I would imagine, or, might it be weakened by particular vegan diets that include raw foods. The matter of tea consumption is timely for me, in that I have elected to eliminate fermented tea from my diet, opting for only green.Am I the only one who would be very grateful for a video on the latest news about what we can add soy milk to without any or much suppression of beneficial nutrients? Fruit and veggie smoothies, coffee, tea?I have the same question. I put a splash of soy milk in my tea, and add almond or soy milk in my smoothies. It would be great to know if that is good, bad, or indifferent.Yes, I’ve been wondering the same thing. Why does Dr. Greger feel that soy in his smoothie is appropriate? Doesn’t that negate the anti-oxidant benefits of all the berries? I still put soy in my tea and coffee, but sometimes, I reach for the hemp milk instead, despite the less pleasant taste. Not sure that’s a benefit, but maybe…. A video on all this would be great!Abover 14% daily energy from proteins you get a massive rise in cancer vulnerability (china study), with 10 % a good bit safer then 14%. 14 to 20% representing a doubling or even tripling of growth rate, the graph really shoots up after 14%. S0 extra soy protein is probably safe if your daily total is around 10 % of your caloric intake, and reasonably safe at 10 – 14%.Hi Arjan! Thank you. Since the China study treated casein, the safe percentage of protein pertained to animal protein, no?A single cup of coffee can raise your blood pressure by twenty points, before blood pressure screenings. It can increase your heart rate. Drinking coffee in such a way, long term, might raise blood pressure chronically and even damage the vascular system. Switching to Hibiscus tea could lower blood pressure. Blood pressure is the force with which your heart pumps blood, the harder the worse long term. Expresso has almost as much antioxidants as matcha tea. Coffee has anti prostate cancer benefits. However, for immediate help with heart disease, going of coffee could improve your heart rate. So could going on a berry, greens, and beans diet.The best thing we can do is eat, and drink, a diverse set of plants! Videos like this one are perfect for helping us tune the intake specific plants over time to maximize the potential health benefits. It’s the best game I’ve ever played!How about almond milk in smoothie vs soy milk? I have been adding soy milk however, it seams like it is not the best idea.That is really strange, I like my tea very much but I’ve observed a very strong relation between my tinnitus and tea. Stress worsens it A LOT, and to much coffee and tea both literally amplify it too. So from the point of endothelial dysfunction this doesn’t add up, is there anyone here who can fill me in on the missing piece and or pathway, these stimulants can be responsible?I’ve had tinnitus for over 40 years…there are some supplements that claim to help it….those that improve micro-circulation. Main thing is to not fight it…learn to live with it until if and when you find a solution. Mine comes and goes in intensity…stress is probably one factor for sure.One thing that might help is l-theanine…the amino acid found in tea…the sun theanine brand is best…one cap might relax you for 12 hrs or so. I can’t take one every day…makes me too relaxed over time…does give a “sunny disposition” though.My tinnitus is at least partly related to migraine. It comes and goes or it’s louder and softer. I have learned to ignore it.This isn’t the nail in the coffin, but the strength of the evidence supporting coffee’s health benefits has been slowly losing ground over the years. Based on the latest evidence that we have, I’m going to take action and swap one or two of my morning coffees (currently 3 – 4 per week) with tea, which I already drink habitually. Hibiscus, green, black, and chai. I’ll keep drinking a few cups of coffee per week as a treat, and keep an eye on the developing evidence.In the assessment of coffee’s benefits, it is important to remember the basics : coffee is an organic food that has been roasted* and therefore also smoked. High-heat on anything organic is known to create clinically relevant amount of tars, polycyclic hydrocarbons, aldehydes…which is exactly why BBQing is unhealthy. Important occupational risks for coffee roasters that directly involve the gaseous by-products of this “charring” process. http://www.epa.gov/ttnatw01/hlthef/acetalde.html Without even the need to dive into pointy studies, there are predictably going to be pros and cons on anything high in anti-oxidants yet that has been roasted (and therefore smoked) on high-heat, something which tea doesn’t suffer from. Coffee, as much as we love it, is no different from roasted-smoked broccoli or kale :)Correct me if I am wrong, I assume the coffee drinkers did not drink their coffee black? I assume they drank it with sugar, yet they did not measure the amount of sugar. Could it be the sugar and not the coffee itself that spiked the rise in TG?IS ALMOND MILK A CREAMER? I ran through the comments quickly and didn’t see this answered: Is almond (or other non-dairy milk replacement product) considered a creamer? I am a very healthy 59 year old WFPB commercial pilot but have had creeping up BP that is intermittent. I DID drink a lot of black coffee too (2-5 cups a day). Undoubtedly some stress issues can affect BP I understand. But I switched to tea a few months back (trying to stay away from any medical prescription intervention) and have noticed my blood pressure creeping back down to the normal range mostly with no other lifestyle changes. But I do add almond milk because in the early morning after I wake up, the tannins in straight tea make me nauseas and the almond milk seems to keep that from happening.Very interesting. I’m a vegan, and I stopped drinking black tea years ago because I read that unless you add cow’s milk to black tea, the tea leaches iron from your system. True? Not?What a difference a year makes! According to other recent “studies,” caffeinated coffee is great for our arteries.http://www.webmd.com/heart/news/20131120/does-caffeine-in-coffee-perk-up-heart-healthI wonder if cold brew caffeinated coffee would have the same effect. Maybe it’s the heating process that we use to brew the coffee; or it could even be the roasting of the beans and decaffeination clears away whatever we’ve done to the bean during that process. Interesting…“But about 10 years ago a study was published on the effects of coffee on endothelial function, and the function of our arteries.”Dr. G, have there been any recent studies regarding this? We know how “things change” from day to day, especially in the nutritional advice department. :-) I myself drink 2-3 cups of black coffee a day, part of which is decaf. The famous psychic Edgar Cayce said that coffee is a “food,” but only if it’s taken by itself, with nothing added to it. There’s something in cow’s milk, especially, that goofs up the digestion.There haven’t been further brachial artery tourniquet tests of endothelial function comparable to Papamichael et al 2005, but I do think these uncited studies merit attention. Coffee consumption and markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in healthy and diabetic women (2006) Long-term coffee consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies (2013)Oh thank you extremely much for these extra links on the subject. My google-fu isn’t so strong. And this is such a wonderful topic for the good doctor to cover with his followers because for many of us vegans, coffee is one of the few hard-hitting sensory pleasures we have left. I personally think that since most coffee for people and research is prepared with classic coffee makers, a lot of the toxins from the plastic lining can get into the hot water and possibly corrupt the coffee’s benefits.Would appreciate a report on the many coffee alternatives based on chicory, rye, barley, etc. There are tons of these and it appears that they are more popular in Europe, especially France.Chicory is a traditional coffee “extender” in New Orleans (about a third of blends with coffee). Given chicory root is ~40% inulin and ~20% oligofructose, and these prebiotics are commercially extracted with hot water, I’d love to see if chicory brew might offer similar benefits for healthy gut microbiota as the extracts: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.I’ve purchased 15+ different types of these products for tasting purposes. They often also use rye or barley. Some say malted. Some are instant, others require brewing. The powders, though often having a bitter taste, is very pleasing to consume, I mean just dipping your tongue in the powder. I find it hard to stop eating it. One brand, which appears to be the biggest producer in France, is must more sweet though they add no sugars.I gave up coffee a year ago and never missed it since. Was actually very easy. Benefits? Less stinky armpit sweat, no headaches anymore, whiter teeth, less expenses. All upsides, no downsides.Any actual info on fluoride toothpaste and in water?I realize this was not tested but I wonder if drinking black tea with almond milk would avoid the “undermining” aspect they found when dairy milk was added? I need almond milk in my tea and coffee….Getting too complex. I’ll stick with water.I am a black decaf coffee drinker with heart disease. Too bad I can’t stand the taste of tea. Maybe another thing I must force myself to acquire a taste for? Ugh.Here’s my big question for the Doctor. Everyone is going on about Dave Aspray’s Bulletproof coffee, and how they are losing weight and feeling energized etc. The thing that gives me pause is the whole idea of adding butter (albeit grass-fed) etc to his supposedly mold-free coffee. I would love to get everyone’s feedback, especially Dr. Gregor on this huge trend.The bullet proof diet is another play on the paleo diet and has no scientific bearings. Kale, chickpeas and quinoa are considered “suspect” foods, according to the author of this dietary plan. I would not pay attention to this fad diet.Really, after hearing all that I’ll just stick to clean pure water. No B.S. thanksSorry, some of these studies simply sound ridiculous. I drink coffee when I want to and I think I will be fine. I am healthy at 67 and plan to live a little longer but really who the hell wants to live forever?Prediksi bola palermo vs Atalanta .. http://198.50.133.242/prediksi-palermo-vs-atalanta-10-mei-2015/Dr.Greger, where is the video where you said we may be attracted to coffee for good reason?

Thanks for this Dr.This latest research appears to contradict earlier Caloric Restriction (CR) results re the reduction of IGF1 (for example, “Eat, Fast and Live Longer” – Michael Moseley BBC). I will personally sit on the fence on this one until all the numbers are crunched, notwithstanding the fact that I practice both veganism and about 16hrs of fasting per day.Any additional info re the length of CR in hours required to reduce IGF1 would be appreciated.I don’t see any contradiction, Veganchrisuk. People in the CR society limit their calorie intake to around 1800 calories a day- and in my mind, they look terrible-way to skinny! They’re probably cold all the time, can’t exercise much and get sick often. I wonder if they have any libido or good bone and muscle mass- although I understand that their blood lipid levels are as good as a vegan’s. What you practice- and I practice it too, is called intermittent fasting, not to be confused with calorie restriction. I’ve read that it may result in healthy brain aging and it’s possible that it promotes autophagy- the removal of garbage from the cells. The benefits seen in CR seems to be in the body producing ketone bodies from the breakdown of fat, which also happens around 16 hours of fasting, but without depriving yourself of the daily calories you need. Thanks for the Michael Moseley reference; I’ll have to read it.Hi Pat – thanks for the reply. I certainly think you will find the BBC documentary very interesting – I’ve just searched for it and it’s available free on a site with the intitials D M (not sure if I can promote it here). The Cronies (calorie restrictors on optimal nutrution diets) do appear to be aging better than the average person, however I have not seen any comparisons made re vegans or vegetarians therefore I wouldn’t be so quick to discount them, as like all things in life, certain factors affect different people in a variety of ways; what will work for you may not necassarily work for me, and so on.Re the IF, I think you’ve got me slightly confused – what I practive is a daily regime (last meal about 7-8pm, next meal about 12 midday (following a gym session). If I were an Intermittent Faster I would be fasting on an intermittent/irregular basis – you say potatoe, I say potato…..If you’re interested in science as well as nutrution you will also be able to find other BBC Horizon documentaries re The Wonders of the Solar System, and The Wonders of the Universe – fortunately for me they are presented in laymans terms, whereby you are presented with such facts as the human body being comprised of 99.9999% empty space due to the composition of the atoms that we are made of. Or that by jumping from the height of 2 metres on a neutron star (exploded sun), by the time you hit the ground you’d be travelling at 4 million miles per hour – if only we devoted more money to science and the pursuit of knowledge.The key phrase being “in my mind”. It is all in the mind.Cronies who do it right follow a healthy diet that is based on minimally processed roots and tubers, starchy vegetables, grains and legumes, with the addition of vegetables and fruits. These foods are low in caloric density, high in nutrient density and high in satiety (potatoes and sweet potatoes are by far the most filling foods). Cronies eat whenever hungry, until they are comfortably full. They are as lean as possible within the normal range of body weight, as the WCRF/AICR recommend. They wear extra clothing for warmth instead of extra fat reserves, but they are more comfortable when it’s hot/warm too. By definition, optimal nutrition is essential for optimal energy levels, immunity, sexual function and bone and muscle mass.Caloric restriction is the most powerful intervention to extend healthy lifespan in mammals. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12207/fullhttp://www.impactaging.com/papers/v5/n7/full/100581.htmlThe longest-lived populations have all practiced caloric restriction. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17986602http://www.cmj.org/ch/reader/view_abstract.aspx?volume=114&issue=10&start_page=1095http://www.hindawi.com/journals/crp/2011/679187/Hey Pat – It’s interesting to read about fasting from your perspective. I am in a Master of Nutrition and Integrative Health program right now. I’m studying physiology, and I can’t see a benefit to fasting – except that it creates a routine that is satisfying to you. However, I’m no expert (yet! :-) ). Mostly I wanted to write to correct your information about ketones, as they are not made from the breakdown of fat. Ketones are formed from the breakdown of amino acids to feed the cells energy when glucose availability is severely restricted. Amino acids are used for hundreds of physiological functions, including structural – bones and muscle. It is from muscles (skeletal muscle, heart, and kidney muscle) that the body sources the amino acids it needs to make ketones. They are particularly provided to the brain, nervous tissues, and kidneys, which have the enzymes that can transform them into energy. The body produces ketones when there are not enough fatty acids to recreate into glucose, or when that limited supply of glucose must be used by red blood cells (as that is the only source RBCs can use for energy). It’s the body’s emergency back-up for energy resources. It’s certainly useful, but it’s easy to let get out of hand if utilized too persistently.Ketones are formed to produce energy under certain, usually extreme, circumstances, mostly during severe carbohydrate restriction, starvation, or when diabetes is present. The risk of using ketones as a dominant energy source instead of glucose and fatty acids (as our bodies are designed to do) is that it can progress to ketoacidosis, resulting in lowered blood pH (acidic blood), nausea, and even coma and death. So, it really is wise to provide your body enough fuel along and along so that your body has a steady, regulated stream of glucose. Adipose tissue balance is created when 1) food provides glucose for the few hours after eating. 2) Then as those glucose levels dip during the post-absorptive state, the body accesses fatty acids in adipose tissue to provide the steady levels of glucose needed for continued energy through the day. Then it’s time to eat again. Insulin and glucagon provide this energy homeostasis in response to our food intake. Excess glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids are turned into adipose tissue (fat), so that’s where amounts of macronutrients needs to be considered to create adequate energy without packing on the pounds.Nevertheless, there has been increasing evidence that extending the post-absorptive state (which is short of fasting, which technically lasts 24 hours) contributes to long term brain health and longevity. It sounds to me as though what you and veganchrisuk practice is the extension of the post-absorptive state. There’s got to be a snappy term for that!Actually, ketone bodies are created by the breakdown of fatty acids, (ketogenesis), like Pat said:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KetogenesisThe human body doesn’t convert fatty acids to glucose in any appreciable amounts.Perhaps you’re confusing ketogenesis with gluconeogenesis, which is the production of glucose from glucogenic amino acids?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GluconeogenesisHi Ed, thanks for your response. As I mentioned, I’m still working on becoming expert – clearly not there yet! :-)I’m pretty sure I understand gluconeogenesis, so I don’t think that I mixed up the two. In looking back over my text and notes, I think the presentation didn’t draw enough of a distinction between the use of fatty acids vs. ketogenic amino acids. The concept of ketogenesis is obviously still new to me, so I didn’t pick up on the primary use of fatty acids in that process. Still, I understand that under extreme conditions when fatty tissue is used up, lean muscle tissue is converted for energy as amino acids are taken from them for ketogenesis. Those are not the conditions of the post-absorptive state or even fasting.My text describes that fatty acids are tapped by “many cells” during the post-absorptive state as an energy source to produce enough glucose for red blood cells (gluconeogenesis). “Many cells” is pretty vague, but it does make it sound as though fatty acids are routinely tapped to make glucose. Also, during the post-absorptive state, declining insulin and rising glucagon stimulate lipolysis and the release of free fatty acids into circulation. At this point would you say that the fatty acids are being used for gluconeogenesis or ketogenesis? Ketogenesis is explained by my text as being stimulated primarily in response to starvation (starting as one hits a state of fasting, which is much longer than the post-absorptive state), persistent low carb intake, and diabetes.Under the fasting state, the body must rely on gluconeogenesis when glycogen is depleted. Muscle tissues contribute amino acids, lactate, and glycerol to that process, and adipose tissue contributes fatty acids. I’m guessing this is the point where I lose touch with what happens next. I know that ketogenesis begins when glucose sources run dry.Thanks for clarifying and enhancing my education! I think that I will copy this post and put it on my class forum as well. This is one of the few spots in my physiology and macronutrients courses where I still need to shake out misunderstandings before I move ahead. I’m studying nutrition mostly to be able to work with people with allergies and mental illness, but the facet of energy metabolism is critical to any study of nutrition, so I need to be sure I’ve got it!I’d say, vegans today are not skinny exactly, they are as they should be. I have seen loads of old black-and-white movies where we can see how people actually looked like in the past, like 50-60 years ago for example. Some women were chubby, others and most of the population, including men, were extremely skinny and bony. And I am not talking about malnutrition, I am talking about structure, they looked healthy, they smiled, etc… So I think the human body is not supposed to be that meaty, if I can say so, to be that heavy (if you were in the wild after a dear would you be even able to run after it if you weighted 80 kg… tough job, I think :) ) These latest videos here were really interesting, I always watch them after receiving the daily newsletter. And finally, I never count my calories, but when it happens to do so in days when I had huuge appetite and didn’t restrict myself, I would go beyond 2000 calories per day, in the end I feel bloated, heavy, even breathing is a bit hard…. thanks, but I’d stick to below 2000 calories/day… my best days are around 1500-1800… I can’t even understand how other women are supposed to eat 2000+ daily (and most people eat more than that)… I’d be permanently obese…In most japanese regions, and I believe chinese too, people are always skinny because they have smaller portions. Oh, and in some japanese rural areas people live the longest compared to other countries. So, again… I’d stick to lower calory intake. I won’t starve on 1800 calories, but raise the chances of being healthier at older age and maybe even living a bit longer than average. Physical food is not the only food in this world.I know my post gets very long, but I’d like to share something else. I love mountaineering. My country’s mountains are just breath-taking, and every time I go there, strangely, the scenery being that beautiful, I honestly forget about the food. I enjoy the trekking and climbing so much that it fills me constantly with joy and adoration for this beautiful nature… and then… when after hours and hours of climbing, I sit after all to have some lunch or such, then the food tastes the best!!! It never tastes so good when at home or work, or the city…. never…. while in the nature, after hours of beauty, the food is almost godly… although it may be just a silly sandwich… In such trekking days I may even eat lest than usual and the feeling of tiredness is actually even pleasant…Since then I know that eating physical food is not the only thing.i dont limit calories because plant calories are already low and i eat plenty (i am Polish with big appetitie). At 65, I go to the gym 6 days a week for strength and cardio. Did my first sprint triathlon at 65 (3rd place–only 3 women in my age group LOL). I dont get sick and can chase my grandkids around like crazy. Dont generalizeThanks very much for that BBC Moseley link. I watched the video and found it interesting.Good, I’m glad you liked it…..Apologies for the late reply BTWI love that I can get up in the morning and in 4 to 6 minutes learn more information about nutrition than I learned in my whole seven years in medical school and residency. That’s not saying much because the residency programs should be teaching this but it is truly awesome that you put this information together so I can pass this information along to my patients! Especially during this month of Noshember. (No Shave November)Lookin’ good Doc!You are too kind. That pic ended up being too big. Your beard looks better!!!About those well-trimmed beards! Do women like kissing you? Of course, they like you You are both handsome and wonderful men from whom I have learned much, but I am asking about the greyed thistle-texture of the beards? I could not resist asking!You say such wonderful things and you are too kind. Actually I have never grown a beard before. It’s only on my face because of the Noshember idea which I use to bring awareness to cancer and reducing ones risk by eating plant based. Interestingly, I wasn’t going to do it but my wife liked it so I will keep it going but you are right about the texture. She doesn’t like the feeling of the thistle-texture on her. ;(It is sort of embarrassing.I am in my second year as a med student. We know nothing about nutrition. It isn’t covered on step 1 (that looming standardized test) so we have trouble finding the motivation.Without dr g’s videos my nutritional knowledge would be terrible.Some residencies are changing but not fast enough. I had to stay in the “fire” (residency) until I was able to get out and make my own “water”.Hang in there because it is worth it! There is nothing better than watching your patients actually reverse their chronic diseases and improve their quality of life!!I have some years of training ahead.In my education I’ve only really heard veganism be mentioned as a connection with B12 deficiency.How did you improve your motivational interviewing, patient interaction type skills? I still quite often leave patient interactions feeling like the visits are unfocused.When you have chronic disease staring you in the face daily, the same people coming back, and you know you are not helping them, believe me you will find the motivation, (if you love medicine and people) otherwise you might be tempted to quit medicine…Oh I am concerned about it.Motivational interviewing is a practiced skill.It’s hard to figure out all the social causes of disease going on in people’s lives. I hope some things I’ve said in patient interactions have helped people make “better” lifestyle choices. But when someone is weighed down by so much of the stuff of life I’m not sure where the best place to start is.You start where the patient is.Meaning you meet them wh10 PMere they are. Some people will never be able to accept a lifestyle Change and that is OK. I always find ways to bring up plant based eating and “test the waters” so to speak.If I feel like someone is staunchly against changing their lifestyle I don’t push it (you’re meeting them where they are). But if they give me an inch, I will take a mile and educate them about their personal benefits if they change their eating habits.This means if they come in for diabetes u ask them if they would like to get off their medication regarding diabetes. I don’t tell them about lowering their blood pressure. You see? I met them where they are. That is what u call motivational interviewingAt least you know enough to know you don’t know anything. Most people haven’t even learned that much. :)Since we “nosh” so much on turkey day, we have other reasons to call the month Noshember.Thank u doctor, it is so nice to see sometime for change some open minded M.D.The last statement in this video:“It’s not how many calories we eat, Protein intake may be the key determinant of circulating IGF-1 levels in humans, and so reduced protein intake may become an important component of anticancer and anti-aging dietary interventions.”doesn’t make any sense in light of http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vegetarians-get-enough-protein/ which tells us that vegens get as much protein as everyone else. I myself, get about 80 grams of protein a day, much of it from beans. And I don’t think it would be a good idea to stop eating beans to reduce my protein level. So, it can’t be the protein that reduces IGF-1 in vegans, unless the quality of protein in vegetable food is different somehow than in animal “foods.” Other videos indicate that vegans get less leucine and methionine, two components of protein, than do meat eaters. Perhaps that, along with reduced body fat is the reason for the greatly reduced cancer rates in vegans.Animal protein and isolated soy protein will both increase IGF-1 levels, whereas regular plant protein will not. So avoid anything made out of isolated soy protein such as soy “chicken” and protein bars.What about whey isolate?Whey is dairy product disguised by a different name. Any isolate is processed, and it is best to steer clear of processed foods in general. Being that it is a dairy product, it is also a cancer promoter. If you haven’t seen “Forks Over Knives” (the documentary on Netflix), I highly recommend watching it.from where do you take this fact?! it`s not true at all, soy protein are ok, in reasonable quantities, of course…Isolated soy protein is extracted from the soybean, and is about 95% protein. Dr. McDougall discourages eating it: https://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2005nl/april/050400pusoy.htm .Also, Dr. Fuhrman recommends minimizing consumption of it: https://www.drfuhrman.com/library/Animal_protein_IGF-1_colon_cancer.aspx.Information on soy is diverse and contradictory. Try better a review: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257705/.Isolated soy protein is nothing more than concentrated protein from soy grains! If added in small quantities from time to time, when needs for proteins are high and one has not the capability to eat enough, they are not at all harmful.When I studied nutrition I learned about complementary proteins, which are plant proteins/amino acids that, when combined, are equivalent to animal source proteins, e.g., peas and rice combined can equal animal protein amino acids. Not much is said anymore about complementary cooking and combining at meal time. It is my opinion that many are under the impression that plant protein is high quality protein, which is not factual UNLESS or UNTIL complementary cooking and eating is practiced.May I suggest this site http://www.nutrition411.com/patient-education-materials/allergies-intolerances-and-special-diets/item/2282-complementary-proteins-origins-and-recipes/ for a ‘crash course’ in complementary proteins.Hi, Catherine. The complementary protein mythology has long since been proven incorrect. See here: http://www.diseaseproof.com/archives/diet-myths-complementary-protein-myth-wont-go-away.htmlyeah, Catherine. I thought I read about a year ago that this thing is a myth. Glad to see you dispel it.It is not at all a myth. You don`t have to eat them at the same meal. However, you have to eat complementary proteins.Just think cereals don`t have enough lysine. Without legumes, which are complementary to grains and nuts, it will be very hard to fulfill your necessities in essential amino acids.Corina-Aurelia: The information on the following page contradicts your post. I don’t believe there is anything in the following article that is disputed. As long as you eat enough calories in a whole plant food diet that includes more than just fruit, you don’t have to worry about protein combining or getting enough of certain amino acids. As explained in the following article, the person who originally came up with the idea of needing to worry about complementary proteins has long since retracted it: http://michaelbluejay.com/veg/protein.htmlHi Catherine! Thankfully, we now know that carefully matching complementary protein within meals is not necessary. You may find this resource from the vegetarian dietetic practice group of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics informative: http://vegetariannutrition.net/docs/Protein-Vegetarian-Nutrition.pdfCatherine: You have already gotten some great replies to your post. Here is another resource that is wonderful for understanding the big picture about protein. In other words, it does more than dispel that one myth. It’s a very good education about protein in general: http://michaelbluejay.com/veg/protein.htmlIs IGF-1 a standard test my doctor can order AND, as testing procedures vary leading to varying nominal results, how would we best use that information? I would guess we’d want our IGF-1 levels to be below normal, as normal would be what a western diet produces.IGF-1 testing (also known as somatomedin C) is not routinely used in clinical care. It’s possible that reference ranges haven’t been established, and, much like a blood glucose level, one isolated reading wouldn’t be very informative due to normal fluctuations. It is occasionally used in some pediatric diseases (to which I cannot speak), but generally, this test is only used in research protocols.Thanks Kerri. I am a bit of a numbers nerd so I like stuff like this. I take your point that a single data point is not useful, but, if the test were inexpensive (unlikely) and available I would have it done as a curiosity, even out of pocket. Also I have another interest in the test. My family doesn’t sucomb to heart disease. Cancer is our achilles heal, and, in the first instance brought me to veganism 4 years ago. Since then, the moral and ethical issues have made it a lifestyle easy to maintain.It would be really useful to have a video on protein, less from the chemistry building blocks (amino’s, etc) and more from the practical dietary viewpoint. What plant proteins can be listed as best and worst? It seems there’s some question about soy-derived products vs animal proteins, and this question is always coming up. Dr Greger’s videos and blogs are the first thing I do in my email every day, and I even post them on Facebook, contribute, buy the DVD, etc. It’s wonderful, I urge everyone to connect up, give and take from this bounty.bobluhrs: I totally agree with you that NutritionFacts is awesome. Thanks for your post.Concerning the topic of protein: I think you would find the following articles to be real eye openers. By the time you work your way through these two articles, you will have your answer, and so much more. Why Protein Is A Non-Issue: http://michaelbluejay.com/veg/protein.htmlTo fill in yet some more details is Dr. McDougall article from December 2003: http://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/newsletter/archives/ You might also check out the January 2004 newsletter article, Protein Overload.Hope that helps!Thea, Thanks for posting the, “Why protein is a non-issue” article. I’ve never seen that article before and it is very good.Your welcome! That article really helped me when I was first thinking about going vegan. It really helped allay my fears about protein concerns so that I could focus on what really matters.A plant based diet may unintentionally create calorie restriction. How about the feast/famine complex. A person in famine may develop fat cells to survive. Isn’t a base number of calories necessary? Granted that eating fruit and vegetables may seem like a feast but does it meet minimum required calories. Also, fat cells carry estrogen but, don’t plants have estrogenic reactions as a defense mechanism? I have been a vegan for the last 20 years.More great information! One question re. plant protein: As a vegan bodybuilder, I have a pea protein drink ea. day. Does that form of plant protein also increase IGF-1 levels?i was about to post an almost identical question but then just in time saw this. I’m not body building but i’m a long distance runner and have a protein enriched shake a day, containing about 30g of plant based protein isolates (pea, brown rice and hemp protein) and was wondering as much as Gerald if those protein isolates also have the potential of increasing IGF-1 levels?Only animals produce IGF-1. But plant protein, specifically soy protein, also seems to trigger our body (muscles and liver) to make it: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21711174https://www.drfuhrman.com/library/protein_powders_muscle_growth.aspxDr. Fuhrman suggests that if one wants to eat plant protein isolate (although one doesn’t need it; eat more whole plant foods that are high in protein rather than processed powders) then pea protein is a good choice (as is hemp and rice).In addition, plant protein in general (excluding soy apparently) seems to bring our IGF-1 levels down: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16201743They believe the issue with soy is that it’s amino profile is too similar to animal protein.very reassuring :)thanks!I’ll 2nd that Olaf. I too am very active and prefer to use pea protein from time to time. All the research I have done has since shown nothing but good health benefits and no adverse change in cardiovascular markers and common blood panels. Nevertheless, I am not a researcher. If there is other evidence out there, someone please post.I use pea protein as well. PS. Combine brown rice and pea proteins :-)Methionine-restricted mice have lower serum IGF-I, insulin, glucose, and thyroid hormones. If you wish to downregulate IGF-1 levels, you could consider lentil, kidney bean, adzuki, and split pea instead of soy. To be prudent, you should still meet your RDA for methionine. We don’t know what level of lowered intake is safe in the long term. You can track your micronutrient intakes at a number of free sites (cronometer.com, nutritiondata.com).source Miller RA, Buehner G, Chang Y, Harper JM, Sigler R, Smith-Wheelock M. Methionine-deficient diet extends mouse lifespan, slows immune and lens aging, alters glucose, T4, IGF-I and insulin levels, and increases hepatocyte MIF levels and stress resistance. Aging Cell 2005;4:119–25.This is not a snark, but why does someone need more protein when they are physically active? I can understand more calories are burned but why do you need more than the usual proportion of protein found in whole plant foods? thanksI include a protein drink for three reasons: one, observational: vegan bodybuilders are smaller than non-steroid carnivore bodybuilders (one big difference, protein consumption, I think); two, research: lots on protein amt & synthesis & muscle growth (as Casey Stengel said, “You can look it up”; three personal: I feel better & my muscles are a tad bigger with my protein drink. Your observation is reasonable, Coacervate, & I’ve wrestled with it myself, but I do think I’m a bit more buff with the protein drink (I’m not a big guy — 165 lbs. — so I want all the power & muscles I can pack in & on)There are a few reasons why I add some extra protein to my post workout shake. Not that I can quote any studies here but it appears that there’s a window of about 30 – 90 minutes after a strenuous workout during which the body is more ‘open’ to absorb nutrients. So I mix carbs (bananas, dates, etc) with oat milk, some blueberries if I have some, raw almonds, once in a while even leafy greens as spinach and 30g of protein powder. That is much quicker done and digested than boiling rice and lentils – so it can be regarded as a convenient thing.It does fill me up and it also lasts much longer as if I skip the protein. Without the protein, I’m very often extremely hungry within 1,5 – 2h max after that shake.Above average workout does call for above average nutrient intake. So I thought that 30g of extra protein won’t hurt but this particular video raised some doubt.I, too, subscribe to the “window open for absorbing nutrients.” There is research supporting it (I’ve come discussions of it in bodybuilding magazines), but I’ll also add, just with respect to personal experience, that when I’m lifting, I sip my pea protein drink (mixed with pomegranate juice, a banana) throughout my workout, and it definitely adds endurance & zip to having a good workout, in contrast to times when I don’t have the drink. When I do aerobic work (powerwalking) every other day, I have the drink after the workout, primarily for the reason you explained.Hey, Olaf. Anecdotal evidence aside, it seems, according to this study, that the belief of an optimum after-workout window in which to digest protein is an urban, or rather gym, myth: http://www.jissn.com/content/10/1/53/abstractWhat Coacervate may have been getting at is that we can get all the amino acids we require, and can use, through eating whole plant foods. If we exercise more, we burn more calories, requiring us to eat more. If we eat more whole plant foods as a calorie source, we naturally consume more amino acids (aka proteins).Here is a very in-depth article on protein requirements from the World Health Organization: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/who_trs_935_eng.pdfIt states:“A more active person expends greater amounts of energy, consumes greater amounts of food, and hence has a higher absolute level of protein consumption.” p.12And, as this study out of MIT shows, it is a myth that we cannot easily get our protein requirements from plants. It is also a myth that we need to mix protein sources at the same meal. Our body stores, intracellularly, amino acids that our bodies do not make. So when we eat foods with these limiting amino acids, like lysine, our body stores them, and uses them as needed. See page 1209S, last full paragraph here: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/59/5/1203S.longThe other critical misconception is that we, as a society, see nutrition as compartmentalized: proteins, carbs, minerals, etc. We don’t realize how that there are thousands of chemicals and hormones and micro and phytonutrients at play in ways we may never understand. Muscle formation, in other words, depends on so much more than just taking in more protein because there is so much involved on making muscle tissue. Here is one more quote from the WHO study: “The pathways of amino acid metabolism and interchange are critically dependent on adequate micronutrient status, and hence upon the amount and quality of food consumed. *** In addition, with either supplementation or food fortification, disposal of any excess consumption of micronutrients can impose . . . stress on the body.” See page 12.In other words, pounding our body with supplements (like protein isolate in any form) in excess of what we need only makes our body work harder to get rid of the excess. This doesn’t happen if we just get our calories (and hence amino acid requirements) from whole plant foods.Point being that supplementing your diet with more protein is not needed. But since it is plant protein, there is no harm, whereas doing the same with animal protein (whey, dairy, meats, etc.) does have harmful effects.Thanks for putting it into words. On a personal level my family and closest friends are so concerned that äm I getting enough protein”. Cripes, I’m building green houses and installing water pumps around the farm…what do they want? I’ve never felt better. I think some confuse vegan with Whole Foods, Plant based. The two can be lightyears apart. WFPB = health. Blood simpleNo problem. I enjoy researching this stuff. I always learn something. You can have your family read the MIT article on protein myths. Also, show them these two vegan/plant-based athletes, just as examples: MMA fighter Mac Danzig, and one of the world’s strongest men, Patrick Baboubian, who recently set a world record in one event. These guys can achieve and maintain their endurance, strength and muscle mass although they are training harder than 99% of the population ever will. In other words, if they get enough protein without animal products, I’m sure the rest of us will be alright.http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/09/08/vegan_strongman_shoulders_550_kg_a_record_perhaps_at_vegetarian_food_fest.htmlhttp://www.veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bio_danzigI agree that vegan and whole food, plant based (WFPB) are different. I try to make the distinction with people all the time. They see that I don’t eat animal products, and they say I’m vegan. At the most I could say I eat like a vegan almost all of the time. Vegan, to me, however, means a lifestyle based on the moral and ethical issues behind the killing of animals for food and clothing (no wool, no honey, no leather, etc.). Whole Food, Plant Based, for me, means a primary focus on my personal health through the consumption of whole plant foods, although secondary issues are definitely environmental, ethical, and moral issues that deal with factory farming specifically. With health not being the primary focus with some vegans, they may tend to eat a lot of processed “vegan” food, and be just as unhealthy as someone on the SAD diet. This is why I don’t like calling myself a vegan. I eat honey, have leather clothing, have recently eaten venison from deer that friends have gotten. Calling myself a vegan only takes away from what the word really means.Your post reminded me of this cartoon: http://www.sexyfitvegan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/protein-cartoon.gifoh crimmony! what a great ‘toon…I’m mass distributing asap.Remember the catch-phrase Ïts the economy, stupid.” Well, I’d leave out the “stupid” because people are brainwashed, but I would love to drill everyone with Ïts the Nutrition”! Leave the belief systems out of it. The science is about nutrition and that is what we ALL should be adopting as the common denominator …. he said, preaching to the choir :)Yeah. I love that ‘toon. You should read Michael Moss’s book, “Salt, Sugar, Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us”. Incredible. Pulls the curtain back on how the food industry, as you say, brainwashes us.http://www.amazon.com/Salt-Sugar-Fat-Giants-Hooked/dp/0812982193Yes, nutrition should be the common denominator. Health costs, environmental issues (less factory farmed animals) and other issues would fall in place if people adopted a mostly whole food plant-based diet. But people on this site are the “choir”!! Which is why I try to get people on this site and watching documentaries about nutrition and where their food comes from. Chipping away one person at a time…Coacervate, here is my response to Olaf, but it actually addresses your question, too, so I’m replying to you.Hey, Olaf. Anecdotal evidence aside, it seems, according to this study, that the belief of an optimum after-workout window in which to digest protein is an urban, or rather gym, myth: http://www.jissn.com/content/10/1/53/abstractWhat Coacervate may have been getting at is that we can get all the amino acids we require, and can use, through eating whole plant foods.

But since it is plant protein, there is no harm, whereas doing the same with animal protein (whey, dairy, meats, etc.) does have harmful effects.Thanks for another video to keep me plugging along at this.“But the vegan group didn’t just eat less animal protein, they ate fewer calories.”That sentence reads like they did eat “some” animal protein. Not so, though, right Dr. G?They did eat “less” animal protein than the other group to the tune of zero (or they wouldn’t be vegans).Yes, that’s the point I was trying to make. A female can’t be “less” pregnant, say, than Suzy. Either she IS pregnant or she AIN’T. Same with vegans They don’t touch animal products, so IMO the sentence came off as awkward. “Less” should not have been used.You should make a video explaining how statistics work, in layman’s terms. I’m curious about the exact meaning of “metastudy,” for example.for a definition of what a ‘metastudy’ or rather a meta-analysis is, have a look at the linked wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysisIgf 1 seems to be of benefit to older people. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14563498If this is true, a vegan could consume more isolated soy protein to increase his/her IGF-1 levels.I’ve gained weight since going vegan. I wasn’t overweight before but now i’m about 10 pounds overweight. Help! any ideas? I really want to stay on a plant based diet but this is frustrating.Check your fat intake as well as how much of your food is processed. Chronometer is a good place to keep a diary. Also, you might be gaining water weight, as plant foods, more simply carbs, require water molecules to travel to your cells. Make sure you get enough water so that you don’t become bloated. My 2 cents.I’m experiencing analogous problems. I have noticed that eating cooked foods make my abdominal fat grow especially if i try to get some muscle mass on. Trying to get enough plant protein I eat a lot of whole grains and legumes. But they are very rich in carbs. Ol of them contain more carbs than protein. I’ve also noticed that I’m gettin skinner when eatin more raw foods.cindy: Most people lose weight when they go vegan. A small, but noticeably “lucky” few gain instead. I can understand your frustration. Usually the weight gain is easy enough to fix if you tweak your diet using the basic principles discussed in these talks:1) Free lecture available on line by Dr. Lisle. “How To Lose Weight Without Losing Your Mind” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAdqLB6bTuQ2) Try Jeff Novick’s DVD, Calorie Density; Eat More, Weigh Less and Live Longer. Also check out Jeff’s DVDs in the Fast Food series. Great, affordable food that is easy to make. All of these are available on Amazon. Here is the first one: http://www.amazon.com/Calorie-Density-More-Weigh-Less/dp/B003ASP6JE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1392424210&sr=8-1&keywords=calorie+density%3B+eat+more ———————— There are some good resources/cookbooks that give more detailed guidance on putting the above ideas into action. So, after you watch one or both of the above lectures, you might take a look at: > The Starch Solution (Dr. McDougall) > Breaking The Food Seduction (Dr. Barnard) > Consider going through the free 21 Day Kickstart program by PCRM.

Sounds like you can either have close to 0 risk and be learn, small and have the body run in a maintenance mode do to speak but to build strength size or have increased ability your risk rises…Unfortunately, the connection between IGF-1 and cancer is not as simple as Dr. Greger would have us believe. For example, the older we get, the MUCH HIGHER our risk of developing cancer but the MUCH LOWER our blood levels of IGF-1. Also, a person who needs to increase their bone density and muscle strength would greatly benefit from eating extremely healthy foods such as natto, tofu, edamame, unsweetened soymilk, soy yogurt, soy sprouts, fenugreek seeds, wheat germ, and/or wild ocean fish, all of which are high in the amino acid, methionine, and therefore will successfully raise our blood levels of IGF-1, thereby increasing our bone density and muscle strength.Meanwhile, here’s an interesting scientific study that links LOW blood levels of IGF-1 with INCREASED risk of developing aging-related diseases and SHORTER lifespans in real human beings. Strangely enough, when this same experiment was done with worms, flies, or mice, researchers got the exact opposite result: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19913048I wonder if there is any statistics about the longevity and general health of meat eating bodybuilders since they apparently should have relatively high blood levels of IGF-1 due to constant consumtion of animal proteins either from foods and protein supplements. I personally know a couple of amateur bodybuilders in their 50 who seem to be quite healthy and vital.This study in mice suggests a possible causal link between reduced IGF-1 with aging and decreased survival. Specifically, the authors suggest that it’s a combined relationship, with high GH in the face of low IGF-1 being what is driving the extra mortality in these mice.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12188/pdfThere is also this:http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140311163101.htm“Research suggests that as people age, their ability to absorb or process protein may decline. To compensate for this loss, protein requirements may increase with age. Megumi Tsubota-Utsugi, PhD, MPH, RD, of the National Institute of Health and Nutrition in Japan, and her colleagues in Tohoku University and Teikyo University, Japan, wondered whether protein intake might affect the functional capabilities of older adults. They designed a study to investigate the relationship between protein intake and future decline in higher-level functional capacity in older community-dwelling adults in Japan. Their analysis included 1,007 individuals with an average age of 67.4 years who completed food questionnaires at the start of the study and seven years later. Participants were divided into four groups (quartiles) according to their intake levels of total, animal, and plant protein. Tests of higher-level functional capacity included social and intellectual aspects as well as measures related to activities of daily living.Men in the highest quartile of animal protein intake had a 39 percent decreased chance of experiencing higher-level functional decline than those in the lowest quartile. These associations were not seen in women. No consistent association was observed between plant protein intake and future higher-level functional decline in either sex.”My impression is that up to age 65 or so…being a vegan pays off in reduction in cancer…after 65 see the above?Also this:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123210000573l-Arginine: anti-aging pilot study“In an open-label randomised limited study conducted by the author, 5 g/day l-arginine base was administered orally once at night for 28 days in 21 subjects with age ranging between 41 and 75 years old (14 between 41 and 49 years, 4 between 50 and 59 years, 2 between 60 and 69 years, and 1 between 70 and 79 years), 16 were males and 5 females, 17 were non-smokers and 4 smokers, and 18 of the 21 subjects were taking other medications to control either hypertension, myocardial ischemia, diabetes, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hyperacidity, hypothyroidism, neuritis, or rheumatoid. All recruited subjects gave written informed consent that complied with the principles of the Helsinki declaration.” ……The cohort of people over 65 is increasing daily…yet there’s not a lot of research related to healthy aging? Younger people are going to be so distracted by trying to survive the effects of resource depletion and global warming that they won’t need to worry? Please…do not harm the messenger.What about this?http://www.newswise.com/articles/calorie-restricting-diets-slow-aging-study-finds“Our study shows how calorie restriction practically arrests gene expression levels involved in the aging phenotype — how some genes determine the behavior of mice, people, and other mammals as they get old,” says senior study investigator and NYU Langone neuroscientist, Stephen D. Ginsberg, PhD. Ginsberg cautions that the study does not mean calorie restriction is the “fountain of youth,” but that it does “add evidence for the role of diet in delaying the effects of aging and age-related disease.”Thank You. Always great infoHi everyone. Thanks Michael Greger M.D. for this video. Very interesting :) I am just struggling to understand why you presented the last frame, which I find rather misleading (from “These findings” to “interventions”).The conclusion on rodents/humans seems invalid, unless the studies on rodents compared CR and non-CR using a western diet both with animal protein. More importantly, when it comes to the benefit of protein reduction, this cannot be concluded without the important protein distinction (animal vs. plant), which we know to impact IGF-1 metrics. Also, quid of soya consumption?New question: Why is there such a focus on the IGF-1 by-product instead of the GH that it came from?Dr Gregor. I have a related question. I am a 100% high carb vegan. Presumably i have lower serum IGF-1 levels than the meat & dairy eating population. If i switch from endurance exercise to weight training am i likely to weaken that advantage?May be not all the proteins have the same effect in IGF-1 levels… There are some papers about the differences of the effect of meat protein and milk proteins and it seems that only milk proteins have this effect…http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19423514http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15578035http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15054433hello Dr i am suffering from diabetic nephropathy with creatinine 2.2 plz suggest me what should i eat and how muchDoes the link between “reduced protein intake” and decreases IGF-1 apply any protein or just animal protein?What diet do you follow and why? 80/10/10? And any research?Is the source of protein relevant here for IGF-1 in terms of animal or plant-based? I currently supplement with several scoops of vegan plant-based protein powder each day. Should I be concerned about cutting this to a certain level or is this only relevant to a certain type of protein? thanks.Well, this still ends with a big maybe.This guy is extremely knowledgeable but why does he speak like he has marbles in his mouth? The facts are great but it’s difficult to listen to him for longer than 30 seconds.At the end of the video, the Dr. says something to the effect of people with high protein intakes generally have a higher IGF-1 levels. Does this include plant based protein sources? I can’t imagine the doc saying that protein from beans, for example, are just as unhealthy as protein from an animal source.Thanks for all your efforts and informationIt’s very controversial. What about this study? “A study from Tulane University published this year (2014) showing that people who went on a low-carbohydrate diet lost more weight in one year than did those in a group who followed a low-fat diet for the same amount of time. More importantly, the study showed that the people on the low-carbohydrate diet ended up with fewer cardiovascular risk factors. ” http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/QAA401531/Low-Carb-or-Low-Fat-Diet.htmlHere’s the study being referencedhttp://www.normanmarcuspaininstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Effects-of-Low-Carbohydrate-and-Low-Fat-Diets.pdfFirst thing to point out is “lost more weight” and “ended up with fewer cardiovascular risk factors” tend to mean the same thing in these short term studies. Losing weight alone improves bloodwork, so the way this and many other trials like it are designed, it’s simply whichever group loses the most weight will look the best on paper.Second thing to point out is that 30% of calories coming from fat isn’t “low fat,” and the 15 grams of fiber a day (the same as the low carb group, even though fiber itself is a type of carb) points to refined carbs in the low fat group rather than whole foods that are associated with lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. These studies aren’t very useful for determining what we should eat since they basically just put people on the standard American diet and another group on a slightly less bad diet and then see who loses more weight. It doesn’t mean you should eat less carbs and more fat, it means if your diet is already terrible, reducing the amount of refined carbs you eat (and the calories you consume) will give slight health improvements that may ultimately do nothing for you.I have a question for Dr. Greger What is your recommendation regarding how many calories one should consume? Of course when on a plant based diet. Thank youTal, as long as you consume whole, unprocessed plant foods, calorie needs will be dictated by hunger needs. Eat when you are hungry, till you are full. Counting calories is not necessary.Thank you very much :)Tal: Just to underscore/support what Toxins just wrote to you, here are Dr. Greger’s overall nutrition recommendations. http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/Note how the recommendations do *not* specify a calorie count. That’s because, *if* you eat the right foods, you naturally consume the correct number of calories for your needs. That instinctual ability is built into all animals. Dr. Lisle does a great job of explaining this concept in the following entertaining lecture (which was a great eye opener for me when I first heard it!):“How To Lose Weight Without Losing Your Mind” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAdqLB6bTuQIf you get a chance to watch the above video, I would be curious to hear if you feel that it answers your question to your satisfaction.I can’t get anyone to answer me regarding the latest diet war on youtube, perhaps the NF team can?! The big claim is adult women can eat 1600 calories per day (and even lower, I have seen people doing 800-1000) with lots of exercise, and this is a healthy weight loss plan. I wonder if this is true, because online calculators put me at needing 2400 a day to walk my dog, and I am a 31 year old woman who is 5’8″, 115 lbs, and have always had a bmi of only 18 which I think classifies me as one of those “naturally tiny people”. I do not understand how it could be healthy to eat less than what is needed to sustain a tiny body like mine. Can you guys help me understand this?Hi Nia. Calorie needs are vague and confusing. There are many ways to calculate energy needs using a plethora of equations that take into account age, activity level, disease states, etc. I cannot crunch your individual numbers, but I might add it may not be necessary. Here is the DRI for energy intake, if interested. Here is more information that may help: In this study, A multicenter randomized controlled trial of a plant-based nutrition program to reduce body weight and cardiovascular risk in the corporate setting: the GEICO study participants followed a plant-based diet with no portion control and still found significant weight loss. A few more videos on calorie restriction and diet from Dr. Greger if interested. And here. Let me know if this helps? I tend to avoid youtube wars :) as there are so many different approaches to diet and health it’s hard to know who is “wrong” or “right”. That’s why we have the research here free and available so everyone can make up their own mind.Thanks for your questions, JosephHow many calories should a person eat? I feel a lot of people (plant based and not plant based) argue on what really is calorie restriction and what is considered over eating therefore gaining weight.Hi Courtney. I touched on this below. Please see my comments and let me know if they’re helpful? The short answer is am not sure what the perfect amount of daily calories, especially because what we eat varies daily and we’re all different. Most of the studies I have been a part of discouraged calorie counting and portion control. I cited that study below. See if it helps.Thanks, Joseph","['aging', 'animal protein', 'animal studies', 'athletes', 'body fat', 'caloric restriction', 'calories', 'cancer', 'chemotherapy', 'children', 'IGF-1', 'liver health', 'mortality', 'obesity', 'plant-based diets', 'protein', 'side effects', 'smoking', 'tobacco', 'vegans', 'vegetarians', 'weight loss']",What is the best strategy to lower the level of the cancer-promoting growth hormone IGF-1?,That same data set that compared plant eaters to marathon runners was also featured in Hibiscus Tea vs. Plant-Based Diets for Hypertension and Arteries of Vegans vs. Runners.More on the caloric consumption and longevity:What exactly is IGF-1 and what is the relationship to animal protein consumption?

If they ate the same amount of food as non-infected people, the fat had to come from somewhere, perhaps because less muscle was being made or sustained- and that, perhaps due to a lack of exercise. Or perhaps the virus slows down the rate of metabolism while leaving hunger at the same level. Exercise would likely return the metabolism to the correct rate. Even if more stem cells convert to fat cells, what’s filling these cells with fat if they eat no more than normal and especially if they exercise. I’d like to see a study done to test the effect of exercise of various kinds on infected people.I’m thinking even better would be to eliminate the virus all together….Yeah we shouldn’t be having this virus in the first place. It would be nice to know how exercise or an increase in plant intake would impact the effects of the virus though.I’m wondering how elimination of meat intake has an effect on the virus.If you don’t eat chicken meat you don’t get the virus (not so far, anyway.)So, your plan is to eat chicken and “protect” yourself by throwing in some green veggies and doing pushups? That didn’t work for the polio virus.Exercise doesn’t prevent other viruses from spreading. Regardless, it’s not likely avid exercisers were culled out of the study. Considering we are an obese population of epidemic proportion, how would we survive if the chicken fat virus could mutate and transfer from human to human.Dr G – Is this the same adenovirus that is attacking kids here in Colorado, or is it a different strain? Viruses are some of the smallest living things, much smaller than a human cell. I wonder if adv36 has adapted to the point where it can control the fat mechanisms in the human body so it is able to hide there to avoid the immune system? It is clear that viruses can and do hide in the human body – as demonstrated by the ability of the chicken pox virus to hide for decades, then re-emerge as shingles decades later. No sign of the virus in between, and the adaptation of the immune system to destroy it in the first place does not work for the later shingles version. What does this say about ebola, which is also a virus?Why poultry showed highter gains might also be due to meateaters eating more chicken nowadays in response to all the red meat scares. Either way, best to not eat meat at all.Big pharma is coming! Antiviral therapy for obesity…NOT! Even better, blend antiviral drugs into ground meat together with a statin drug.Don’t give them ideas… :-)Exactly – sad but likely this is making many see $$$Big pharma is probably already working on a therapy already.It’s probably going to be another spice again. They take the spice, modify it a bit, and then call it a drug.It may be that our immune systems are compromised due to issues with virus, bacteria and Protozoa (specifically FL1953) that live in and is protected by biofilm. Fat feeds this protozoa and makes it stronger. Until we can lower the fat not only in our diet but also on our bodies our immune systems can’t detect these pathogens that hide in this fat and biofilm. A good portion of our immune system lie in our guts. The one thing that ONLY WE have control over is our diet. But sadly it’s the one thing many sick people refuse to change. They are looking for a pill to “fix” things without making any lifestyle changes. Becoming a low fat, whole food, vegan is our key toward better health.IssieGenetic and epigenetic reproduction?http://www.nonags.org/members/nijqk/ready-to-reproduce.jpgMethylation dysfunction causing some issues with mutations in gene function, maybe.IssieWow, the implications of this are staggering, even beyond the obesity factor. The whole virus thing in relation to factory farming alone is enough to scare one away from eating animal products, even if they had no ethical or previous health concerns! HINT HINT!I’m sure it will be on the nightly news this evening so Americans are warned to stop eating chicken. Media has our backs. (snicker)The ” I’m big boned ” excuse just got a little kid sister! ^^My question is — does the virus eventually die off, or is there anything that people who already have this virus can do to get rid of it?

Please see here http://plantpositive.com/25-cholesterol-confusion-8-a-l/It seems the doctor who was interpreting these studies for the egg Board was bending over backward to find data supporting egg consumption. Common sense tells us that eggs are high in cholesterol and it doesn’t matter how you characterize the cholesterol (fluffy), we have known for a long time that it contributes to heart disease. Maybe this doctor truly believes the message or maybe it is the paycheck that motivates the message.One of the authors is Volek. He is an outspoken proponent of the ketogenic diet for athletes. He has major conflicts of interest, including his association with the board.Yet, the ingestion of cholesterol doesn’t raise lipid cholesterol numbers in any meaningful way. So your premise is false.We can see an example of the problem of the century: corporations that can influence an entire nation policy.And the corporations had to think to their interests, so:1) MAXIMIZE profits.2) MINIMIZE losses.And the people’s health ?Well, that not fit in the equation.Ah, the incredible, inedible egg. I have been hearing a lot of hoo-ha from friends and family regarding the virtues of light fluffy LDL’s as opposed to its evil brethren, the small LDL’s and that one needn’t worry much about either because only oxidized LDL’s was harmful anyway. I often point out that if one were not consuming foods that would raise LDL’s in the first place, there would not be excess of LDL’s to oxidize. Now I come to find from the 2009 study sited in today’s video, that fluffy LDL’s raise hear disease risk by 44% as apposed the small LDL’s which raise it by 63%. What beliefs some people won’t cling to in order to justify their bad, familiar diets…Great video. The large vs small has been championed on medical “information” shows for a couple years now. Great to finally be able to discuss these claims intelligently! Thanks for showing us the numbers. I think this in another video I’ll add to my Elementary Stats class as an example of the misuse of statistics, and how by carefully wording your sentences you could actually be telling a partial truth. Reminds me of Darrell Huff’s book on “How to Lie With Statistics” written 60 years ago!Michael, the book is a free download on the internet. I just grabbed it…all 124 pages. Thanks for the mention.Having problems making comments? Disqus has been a bit wonky lately.http://carbsanity.blogspot.com/2014/09/disqus-and-moderation.html?m=1This is the kind of information I’d like to see presented on the Dr. Oz show. It would certainly start a conversation. And for anyone who claims Dr. Fuhrman and Dr. McDougall are 99% in agreement, well, I guess maybe this is why McDougall says “NO meat or dairy”. Still Fuhrman accepts meat three times every week. I hope he doesn’t claim that is a vegan diet.As an added thought, one table I viewed showed one egg has between 70 and 80 mg of cholesterol while one large chicken breast has 165 mg. Meat eaters think they are avoiding fat by eating chicken. They are in disbelief when they lean how much cholesterol is in chicken.Hi slider1, yes I agree it’s unfortunate the tendency for people to think of chicken or fish as healthier. Sometimes we have comments on here with the sentiment that people are just being willfully ignorant if they’re eating unhealthily, but with all the misinformation in the lay media pointing to chicken, fish, dairy, eggs as being healthy “lean” proteins, coupled with a universal love for “healthy” fats like olive oil, and now coconut oil, I really sympathize with people who might really think they’re eating well but remain unhealthy and overweight. Especially since often those people really are putting in a lot of effort into counting, tracking, and restricting portion sizes. Whenever I talk to people about diet, it is always a huge revelation to think that including certain foods as a “protein”, or fat in the form of refined oils are *not necessary*.And not sure if you’re familiar with cronometer.com? It gets referred to a lot on here. It’s a food diary website, and links to USDA data. I find it easier to quickly look up nutritional stats then actually navigating the USDA databases themselves. It makes it very easy to manipulate serving sizes and see how the numbers change. And often they do use colloquial serving sizes e.g. 1 chicken breast, but will list the weight in g or oz along with it so you can see how they’re defining it. Could be helpful to put all these different references you’re encountering into perspective.One thing about is that Ornish actually recommends fish oil on his diet AND egg whites, but no one criticizes him for that. See this, http://ornishspectrum.com/proven-program/nutrition/ that egg whites and fish oils are in the MOST recommended food group. Fuhrman does not recommend any animal foods on his diet, including fish oil or egg whites. He may *permit* them, but he also *permits* junk food as long as all junk food and animal products are below 10% of calories- he recently changed this to 5%. Fuhrman acknowledges that animal proteins can raise IGF 1, which can cause cancer. Even T. Colin Campbell who found this truth about IGF 1 allows animal products as long as they are below 10% of calories. You might also criticize Fuhrman’s supplements, but he doesn’t sell fish oil, but rather an algal DHA supplement, and the D3 supplement is completely Vegan and not based on animal sources. I agree with not eating any meat at all, and it is great that McDougall says no meat or dairy. I try to go further than McDougall and not even eat it on Thanksgiving as you wouldn’t if you were following the Barnard diet. If you are truly following the recommendations of the Fuhrman diet, you won’t be eating animal products, but you would if you followed Dean Ornish’s recommendations.Here, Fuhrman links eggs with many diseases, such as colon cancer and diabetes. https://www.drfuhrman.com/library/eggs_cancer.aspx Another aspect to this issue is that Fuhrman wants to recommend what the science actually suggests on the subject. Does the science actually suggest that we cannot eat any animal products at all? He doesn’t for one moment claim with the Paleo crowd that animal products such as eggs are completely benign. I don’t eat animal products because there is just too much cruelty involved in it. Like I stated, even T. Colin Campbell didn’t claim that people cannot eat any meat at all if they want to be healthy. Of course, one cannot eat very much and be healthy. It has to be very limited, as Fuhrman stated about eggs. Of course, I try not to eat any at all, but this doesn’t depend on the science, but on my own value system.Dr. Fuhrman is a proponent of a “nutritarian diet” which heavily stresses greens, beans, fruits, veggies (esp leafy greens), seeds and nuts. He does not apply the word begin to his diet, although one may practice a vegan nutritarian diet. Like Dr. Greger, Dr. Fuhrman admits that there are many vegans and vegetarians eating lots of junk which is not healthy.NOT TRUE!!! I have his latest book right here–THE END OF DIETING (2014), in which he says animal protein of ANY kind should be 5% OR LESS, preferably none, of our calories. That’s NOT 3 times a week, unless you have just 1 bite!!You are right Laurie. I have never heard Dr Fuhrman say he was vegan but if I had to guess he probably is.I didn’t know where to place this insight, but I will put it here. I just realized what sets Fuhrman apart from the others is NOT that he advocates animal products any more than the rest, such as Nathan Pritikin and Dean Ornish did or do, but rather he is not in the very low fat tradition. This low fat tradition started with Walter Kempner and went through Nathan Pritikin, Dean Ornish, Esselstyn, McDougall and Barnard. All of these recommend a very low fat diet, but Fuhrman doesn’t. Fuhrman advocates eating nuts and seeds more than the others. He doesn’t recommend getting fat or anything from animals, or even vegetable oils for that matter, but rather from nuts and seeds. He is not in the high fat, low carb tradition, but just not in the very low fat, less than 10% of calories from fat tradition. He is plant based and does not advocate any animal products, but remember, some plants do contain fat.Oh yes. Good point. Actually I remember at one point while training more miles I reviewed Dr Fuhrman’s recommendation of what to do when you can’t keep the weight on while training and eating WFPB and he says eat more nuts. McDouggall would say eat more starch. Both recommendations will solve the problem. What do you think Daniel?Off for a run!I guess I would say both. However, that is not quite my problem just yet, since I am trying to maintain an enormous weight loss, But it does seem that beans and nuts both help hold the weight on. I need to get on my bike now, I have been putting it off. I am off today. When I work, I don’t put it off, since I ride to work and then ride back. I need to get going, but thanks.He must know!Dr. Fuhrman isn’t consistent. What you read in his book is different from what he says in the video and what I’ve read in his other articles. Still, how much damage can 5% meat do? McDonald’s hamburgers are “only” 1.6 ounces. One Fuhrman article says eat as much as three servings of meat each week. What is a ‘serving” The US Government says a small serving is 3 ounces. Sounds like Fuhrman is OK with five or six McDonalds hamburgers each and every week. Are we suppose to eat extra broccoli to combat the cancer cell growth? I think Dr. Fuhrman is still evolving and sometimes either forgets what he previously said or recognizes yet another standard he wants to advocate. Maybe he’ll tell us someday.Unfortunately, Dr Oz is part of the problem. He has given a platform to advocates of low carb high fat diets, including proponents of ketogenic diets. They all have asserted on his show the large buoyant fluffy LDL is supposedly benign. And Dr. Oz has played along without objection. In fact he has used his gimmicky contraptions to demonstrate the alleged “safety” of large LDL.Sounds like the egg board is taking a page from the climate denier playbook and just trying to get incorrect info out there that might sound logical to a layperson. This way, people can believe what they want to believe, or as so many omnivores I know say, “well, there’s so much conflicting info out the that I seems best just to eat a balanced diet”. Of course a balanced diet to them is some small amount of veggies with a meal, like a little squash or lettuce on a meat sandwich. It’s a sad tactic but usually works.http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/119/7/931.longLipoprotein Particle Profiles by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Compared With Standard Lipids and Apolipoproteins in Predicting Incident Cardiovascular Disease in Women“In summary, CVD risk prediction associated with NMR lipoprotein profiles in the present large prospective cohort of women was comparable but not superior to standard lipids or immunoassay-measured apolipoproteins. Thus, the present data support the use of standard lipids, in particular the total/HDL cholesterol ratio, which are highly effective and readily available, for routine CVD risk assessment.”Please explain the high TG on her raw vegan diet… .http://youtu.be/iMr7bP5IUeE?t=6mI don’t think your red herring adds much to the discussion. Also, this individual’s extremely restrictive raw food diet that includes primarily fruit is not even close to the recommendations of Dr. Greger. Equating her diet to the guidelines of Dr. Greger or Fuhrer would be like equating the Standard American Diet to Paleo.Anyways, her personal explanation is as follows: “For those who are asking, my triglycerides are OK. They show high but that’s because eating any carbs (especially fruits after you have gone some hours without eating) makes triglycerides go up. Given my perfect cholesterol levels it is nothing to worry about. Any food that had carbs will mobilize fat. Vegans often will test high in TG but have far less risk of heart disease.”Red herring? You buy her explanation? TG of 210 is not OK. HDL of 43 is not OK. She claims her cholesterol levels are PERFECT. High triglycerides coupled with low HDL increases risk for heart disease.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7KeRwdIH04Yes, it is a red herring. You seem like you are trying to associate her diet with Dr. Greger. You are also off-topic and distracting from the evidence in this video as you don’t even discuss the above evidence at all. Google “red herring fallacy” and you will see what I mean.Did you even watch the video you linked or the above video? I would ask you to note particularly where Dr. Greger discusses HDL cholesterol.I never said I buy her explanation nor do I endorse a raw food diet.Hi Eric, I re-watched Dr Greger above. Does he mention triglyceride levels? Did I miss that? Really linked the video but I couldn’t find him talking about triglycerides.Charles Grashow and I discussed this question with her doctor on Twitter. The TG number of 210 was postprandial, not fasting TG. (The doctor’s tests were actually more focused on potential nutritional deficiencies, and the lipids were tested incidentally.) Postprandially that is quite normal. That same number would be of concern if it were fasting TGs.The low HDL-C is not worrisome either under her circumstances. If her TGs were over 400 fasting, that would render the LDL-C calculation unreliable.As Dr. Ornish points out, the surest way to boost your HDL is to eat a stick of butter. Not the healthy way to go (see Seth Roberts).How much does TG rise postprandial? Assuming she did fast, would it fall to normal levels from 210? My point is the doctor was disingenuous is leaving that glaring point out of the discussion and claiming she had PERFECT levels when clearly the results said otherwise.How much do your TGs go up after a meal? Considering triglycerides of 150 fasting is considered a normal level, why wouldn’t 210 be normal after a meal? And if 210 is an unremarkable number, why would the doctor have to address it? Yes, he could have thought ahead to head off any potential confusion and debate, but he didn’t.A 40% TG increase from a raw vegan? Let’s assume her fasting TG is under 100, how much of an increase would that be? 100%?! Eating bacon and eggs wouldn’t shoot TG that high postprandial.My fasting TGs are 50 – so can we make any assumption as to what my PP TGs would be?As MacSmiley and I pointed out on Twitter as well – her VLDL was 42 which is not good at all. Dr. Davis said they will be be checking fasted LDL-P so will see if they post those results as well.Hi Really, Fully Raw Christina looks so Dog-gone healthy I can barely stand it! ( She runs 6 miles per day). Her B12 is off the chart. And if I understand correctly from your Youtube link, she took the supplement “a couple of times” in the last year. I have watched her videos in the past and she has said she doesn’t take B12. How the heck did the B12 get so high. What I noticed was her ferritin level. It is 7 ng/ml. That is low. (granted within “normal’ but just barely). But when mine is that level my legs feel heavy when running. And my endocrinologist says she would like to see it closer to 70 ng/ml. (so i take a plant based liquid iron)And as far as cholesterol and triglycerides it should be fasting since that is what the “ideal” levels are based on. I am surprised the doctor ran them. It will be interesting to see the fasting numbers. I do like the explanation from the doctor regarding HDL and how Christina doesn’t have dietary cholesterol in her diet so HDL lower is OK. I have never heard that before.So Really are you WFPB? Do you eat animal? I am just curious because Eric said Red Herring and I am wondering if you were just concerned and wanted answers or just saying “see vegans aren’t healthy”.So if any of my doctor friends read this should I not be concerned about Christina’s low ferritin (really mine)? Am I just imagining my heavy legs when my ferritin is that low?And i really enjoyed re-watching Dr Greger below. I can’t get enough of that brain.Also Christina has some great recipes for those that are interested. I am not raw but I enjoy her all the same. Her energy is off the charts. She reminds me of Dr. Greger.A study concerning ferritin. http://www.cmaj.ca/content/early/2012/07/09/cmaj.110950.full.pdfThoughts?Veganrunner:Interesting topic. I need to check my numbers, but I think I remember my doctor saying the thought my ferritin numbers were low. I have other issues to deal with and he wasn’t really that concerned or clear on the issue, so didn’t really address it. If you don’t mind sharing, what brand/which liquid plant based iron do you use?Thanks, – JJHi Thea, Gaia Plant Force. It works. Dr Greger has done videos on this before and I have talked with our resident doctors on this site. And they would probably tell me not to worry about it but I swear I can tell a difference when by ferritin is around 10. I have never gotten it above 45 regardless of what I do. Supplement. Eat C foods with meals. Concentrate on high iron foods. I just don’t absorb it well. But what is so curious to me is that Raw Christina must feel OK when she runs. Or at least I am assuming she does. You are welcome! GaleThanks a bunch!!!Thea a bit expensive but no gut issues for me with that particular brand.That’s really good to know. I’m willing to spend money on my health. :-)You made me concerned Really. I had to pull out my blood work. Triglycerides 79-Whewwwww!Is it okay then to eat only egg whites?Hi Normand, please see reply to paulgiomi’s comment with the same question. :)Egg whites have no cholesterol and are all protein, are they ok to eat?The following excellent comment courtesy of NF Team Member Toxins – I copied and pasted from another comment thread, hope this is ok with you Toxins. Btw this is one of those responses of yours I had in mind when I suggested an FAQ page a while back :) ________________________________________________________________________________________1. Egg whites are high in the amino Acid Methionine. Rice has 14 times less of this amino acid and beans 7 time less. When one consumes Methionine in a large quantity (like that found in egg whites), it is broken down into sulfuric compounds. these sulfuric compounds are buffered by the calcium of the bones. the result, over time, is osteoporosis and kidney stones. http://www.vivalis.si/literatu…2.Cancer cell metabolism is dependent upon methionine being present in the diet; whereas normal cells can grow on a methionine-free diet feeding off other sulfur-containing amino acids. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu… http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu…3. Insulin like growth factor is raised significantly by Methionine. Raised levels of IGF-1 = accelerated aging/tumor promotion. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu… http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org…4. Sulfur from Methionine is known to be toxic to the tissues of the intestine, and to have harmful effects on the human colon, even at low levels, possibly causing ulcerative colitis. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu… http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org…(information courtesy of Dr. McDougall)Wow! I learn so much from this website. Not just the outstanding videos but the comment section as well. Dr. Greger hit the nail on the head when he said “who has time to research this” . That’s why this site is an invaluable resource.How is methionine in nuts different than in eggs?The methionine in nuts is the same as the methionine in eggs. Methionine is an essential amino acid, and so is present in all whole animal and plant foods. The difference is in the amount: by calorie, egg whites have about 16 times more than nuts (at least the ones I checked – walnuts, cashews, and almonds).b00mer: Thanks for answering this. I was going to answer something similar, but you did a better job.Just to help supplement what you wrote, I’ll contribute a link I got from Darryl on the topic. He found a list of “Foods Highest In Methionine” from “Self Nutrition Data”. I don’t know how far down you have to go on the list to get to nuts, but it looks pretty far…http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-000084000000000000000.html?categories=1,18,9,0,13,14,5,4,42,16,17,15,6,3,2,11,7,19,21,12,10,8,22Per the nutritiondata link:1oz of raw english walnuts = 66.1 mg of methionine 1oz of whole, dried sesame seeds = 164 mg methionine 1oz of sunflower seed kernels, dried = 138 mg methionine1 egg, whole, cooked, hard-boiled = 533 mg methionineI LOVE this man! Thank goodness he shares so much good information with us all. Thank you, once again, Dr. Greger!This is great! Responses to the most public statements on nutrition are so very needed. Has Dr. Greger made a response to the recent cover article in Time magazine on saturated fat being good for us? “Eat Butter”. Man. How they get away with that sort of thing is beyond me.Plant positive wrote a good response to this in Plantpositive.com.Daniel: Thanks for mentioning that article. I looked it up and thought it was a great piece.For anyone interested, here is the actual page that I think Daniel is referring to:http://plantpositive.com/blog/2014/6/28/how-time-magazine-sacrificed-its-standards-to-promote-satura.htmlUnfortunately Plantpositive is not picked up by main stream media. Wouldn’t it be great if Dr Greger was on the front cover of Time magazine exposing all the nutritional myths.Yes! We want dr Greger on the front cover of Time Magazine!Hi. We are not hearing from you enough. I miss your funny and informative posts.Veganrunner, I like your posts!I can take a hit and a insult to boot and keep on reading if it gets me better information. And I am no sweatheart myself even a quite difficult man to make a point come across, but Mr. Plantpositive has me beat by miles in abrasiveness and after about 60 video’s I just had to take a long break from his attitude. Still not feeling particularly jumping at resuming the torture after a 2 months break.There is a very good reason he is not being picked up by mainstream media, I suspect its a kind of a OCD/autism thing going on there, I don’t want to go full douche here on the guy, but damn he really is hard to swallow. Completely belittleling attitude towards just about everybody and towards thoughts readers/listeners might have while going through his work. He should get some proof reading support before he does his vids, to make it more palatable.There was however so much of what he put up also on Gregers site, that could conclude there is some coöperation going on between the two. In that case Greger being the face was certainly the right call.I think plant positive uses such an attitude in some situations when the offender is extremely dishonest or is hurting people’s health. Especially when they are renowned by the low carb community yet completely foolish. I think its more of a passionate tone, as his site and Dr. Greger’s are very different. Plant positive exists to debunk paleo myths exclusively, Dr. Greger is here to spread the latest in clinical nutrition. For the most part plant positive seems to restrain himself, especially in response to anthony colpo.Stuff like: I would be a fool to take fish(oil) for my fatty acids. People who prefer going to the gym instead of using their brain are %$@&^% (can’t remember) He is a primeval ape because he spends his time lifting weights, if that is how you want to spend your time you deserve …… No thank you very much, with the slight implication that everybody who at any time did take the other option was a easily gullible moron.You can make a list half a book long if you would have the patience of really going through all his video’s. And certainly only partially directed to promoters of bad science, he actually snuffs at people for just enjoying leasure time. In the end every single living person on accord of his or her past decisions gets ridiculed for some of their life choices. You can not sell something by slapping people in the face, it really is as simple as that The youtube numbers speak for themselves, 2 year old movies with less than 3000 views average.The guy should really find help, a few people who can help him filter out the condescending ego orgasms, edit his work a bit. And make his message palatable to more than just the most extreme hardcore nutrition facts junkies. I really think its a shame that he just completely destroys his own effords. Maybe there is a Amy Farrah Fowler out there for him, to just take bucked loads of shit and walk with it?Much of that is taken out of context, nor is all of that negative. It has never bothered me. I feel that the information he shares is worth hearing if I have to hear a few witty remarks.Plant positive wrote a good response to this in Plantpositive.com.How did they get away with that?Poor journalism and ad-driven hitmongering sensationalism. More specifically? By not factchecking the references in the highly inaccurate book upon which that article (and dozens like it) was based.Wow, this is one of my favorite videos so far! I love how Dr. Greger integrates the effect of eggs on LDL cholesterol, “fluffy LDL” & oxidized LDL with all the false claims out there that eggs are a healthy food. Well done!Ehwww, stabbed and shot? Must be better analogues than that particular one. Its kinda tacky.It’s all over the InterWebs, repeated by Dr. Oz, countless low-carbers rationalizing their atrocious lipids, and this pseudo-factoid has unfortunately even been repeated by Dr. Esselstyn in one of the videos on his website, as well as in “The Last Heart Attack” news special that was on a couple of years ago.Thomas Dayspring was correctly pithy when he said that fluffy is an idiotic adjective for large LDL.https://twitter.com/drlipid/status/481980713626267648Has Dr. Greger addressed the author Nina Teicholz and her book, The Big Fat Surprise? I heard her on NPR and now I am confused.Confused? Start at these two blogs which have not only documented Teicholz’s inaccuracies but also her plagiarism.Evelyn Kocur, low-carber herself, but decries dishonesty, false health claims, and pseudoscience in the low-carb community. She is a college chemistry prof with an experienced background in lab science:http://carbsanity.blogspot.com/2014/05/book-review-big-fat-surprise-by-nina.html?m=1Once you’ve read that article, do a search for “Nina Teicholz” on the blog for more posts by Evelyn about the author. There’s lots of primary reference dirt.Also:Seth Yoder’s extensive review, part One and Two (which was written first):http://thescienceofnutrition.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/the-big-fat-surprise-a-critical-review-part-2/http://thescienceofnutrition.wordpress.com/2014/08/10/the-big-fat-surprise-a-critical-review-part-1/Dr. Greger, Thank you very much for providing this information. In the previous egg video, I asked these very questions. This video is the direct answer to my questions. I have always had two eggs a day. Now you have given me something to really think about.Like almost everything in life, you can line up experts on both sides of almost any argument or hypothesis. Even credible experts on both sides – which the author of this study clearly is not since she has a glaring conflict of interest, having received funding from the Egg Marketing Board and then claims she has “no conflict of interest”. Puh-lease!.So for just a minute let’s put aside our prejudices against omnivores (or vegans) and look at some facts with a truly open mind.I like to listen to both sides of an argument, look at the facts (not theories) from both sides and especially look at our evolutionary history to see what kinds of foods people all over the world have eaten for thousands, and hundreds of thousands, of years that sustain optimal health. That says more to me than anything any expert can say.So here is a fact to chew on that will likely cause some indigestion for many:1. Despite low cholesterol intake vegans and vegetarians do not live any longer or healthier lives than omnivores and carnivores.(As Dr. Gregor correctly points out it’s better to look at meta analysis (of many studies on one topic) rather than single studies which may be biased. That’s exactly the kind of meta analysis done in 1999 and again in 2009. They had identical conclusions:The 1999 meta analysis concluded “Comparing overall death rates between 27,808 vegetarians and 48,364 meat eaters there were no significant differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians in mortality from cerebrovascular disease, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer or all other causes combined.”The more recent 2009 analysis (The EPIC-Oxford Study), reviewed the largest sample of vegetarians (33,883) ever examined and came up with identical conclusions, i.e. “Within the study, mortality from circulatory diseases and all causes is not significantly different between vegetarians and meat eaters.”So if eating eggs, meat and other animal foods is so dangerous to health, then non-vegans should be dropping like flies at much earlier ages. Despite what we might like to philosophically or morally believe, the facts prove this simply is not the case.The traditional Okinawan people have the longest lifespans in the world – plus generally excellent health until they finally die – and they eat fish and seafood 3 times a week.In southern Italy there is a blue zone where men live typically to 90 and 100 and they eat a fair amount of meat.Same in a blue zone in Greece with more emphasis on seafood and squid.That does not mean people should eat unlimited amounts of animal foods and animal food products. The Blue Zones proved that diverse people in 5 totally different regions of the world that on average lived longest (typically to ages 90-100) in excellent health ate different diets, largely based on whole plant foods, but NONE of these groups were vegans. Even in the only American group in the Blue Zones, the 7th Day Adventists in Loma Linda, California, only 4% of them were vegans.So in my humble opinion their are valid moral, ethical and religious reasons to be vegan but claiming “it’s better for your health” is simply not true as the facts show.To paraphrase Mr. Spock:“Eat a wide variety of foods, mainly whole plant foods, as well as organic wild and wild-type animal foods, then you can Live Long and prosper.”Here are the links to the two meta analyses I referred to above:Key TJ, Fraser GE, Thorogood M, Appleby PN, Beral V, Reeves G, Burr ML, Chang-Claude J, Frentzel-Beyme R, Kuzma JW, Mann J, McPherson K. Mortality in vegetarians and nonvegetarians: detailed findings from a collaborative analysis of 5 prospective studies. Am J Clin Nutr. 1999 Sep;70(3 Suppl):516S-524S.Key TJ, Appleby PN, Spencer EA, Travis RC, Roddam AW, Allen NE. Mortality in British vegetarians: results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Oxford). Am J Clin Nutr. 2009 May;89(5):1613S-1619SFair points, but no comment on the main focus of this video, the harm that can be done by what some, including yourself, call ” the essential harmless ‘big fluffy’ particles of LDL versus the high density small particle LDL”?Tom Lang, you raise a good point about all of these pieces of theory that don’t fit with what really happens in various Blue Zones. As I mentioned previously the Kitavians are free of CHD with saturated fat and fish intake. But one thing that is interesting here is that I believe the Greeks, Okinawans, Kitavians, etc. all have a diet rich in plant foods. Their meat/fish consumption was very low relative to most American/European diets. Some researchers have postulated that there is a J curve for health and longevity for meat/fish consumption. A small about of meat/fish can be helpful, but if you eat too much it could be very bad. Others have suggested that meat/fish and eating tribes in Africa and the groups from frozen north that have very little plant foods are free of problems. But, I have heard conflicting information on how healthy these groups are. I would like to hear someone answer you and fit these pieces of the puzzle together. Is there one theory that really fits reality? I am not sure anyone knows what it is because of all of the complexities here.Hi Tom,Same here… from 2014:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016752731401290X“Data from observational studies indicates that there is modest cardiovascular benefit, but no clear reduction in overall mortality associated with a vegetarian diet. This evidence of benefit is driven mainly by studies in SDA, whereas the effect of vegetarian diet in other cohorts remains unproven.”What is going on here?JHHowever… this is a nice article. Eating fruits and vegtables does decrease risc…. http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4490.short About 5 servings a day is enough according to this systematic review, more does not provide more benefits. It also mentiones the strange result that vegetarians have no lower mortality risc.The fact that vegetarian doesn’t mean vegan. Those people eat plenty of animal products daily, all but meat.The SDA’s I know really do not have that healthy of a vegetarian diet. A few do but the majority eat rich foods, cheese covers everything, use plenty of oil, and they chow down on the desserts. Vegan or vegetarian does not equal a healthy diet.Maybe it’s because of “Subnormal vitamin B-12 status is prevalent (50%–70%) in vegetarians or vegans in Austria Germany, Italy, Australia, India and China ”http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/6/8/3259/htmHi Tom,I like your logical and scientific approach–Spock would be proud! :)) Not sure if you’ve had the chance to already see it, but here is a thoughtful piece Dr. G. made about the EPIC studies: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-study/re: “Despite low cholesterol intake vegans and vegetarians do not live any longer or healthier lives than omnivores and carnivores.”Here is a study showing vegetarians/vegans living significantly longer: (From PCRM Breaking News e-mail):“Vegetarians Live LongerVegetarian diets can extend life expectancy, according to early findings from the Adventist Health Study-2. Vegetarian men live to an average of 83.3 years, compared with nonvegetarian men who live to an average of 73.8 years. And vegetarian women live to an average of 85.7 years, which is 6.1 years longer than nonvegetarian women. This study is ongoing and includes more than 96,000 participants. The results further indicate vegan diets to be healthful and associated with a lower body weight (on average 30 lbs. lower than that of meat eaters), and lower risk of diabetes, compared with diets that include animal products.Fraser G, Haddad E. Hot Topic: Vegetarianism, Mortality and Metabolic Risk: The New Adventist Health Study. Report presented at: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetic (Food and Nutrition Conference) Annual Meeting; October 7, 2012: Philadelphia, PA.”I know that some older studies show differently, but I believe the tide is turning as people learn how to eat healthy, not just vegan. Dr. Greger is working on a book about living longer. I’m very excited to see what he says in that book as it will be based on the latest information. For me, I think it is just basic common sense that if you are in a group that is getting less cancer, heart disease, etc, then your group is going to live longer.Hi Thea,Just a quick reply.I agree that slowly the tide is turning that some people are beginning to learn that they can heal themselves by eating healthier and being more active.For me one of the “gold standards” in living a healthy and very, very long life are the examples set by the many 90 and 100 year olds in the 5 Blue Zones. Although none of them are vegans, they do eat a mainly whole plant foods diet.Their longevity is also do to other factors aside from their diet. They do a huge amount of physical labor/activity their entire lives, have a tight knit supportive social community, have a strong spiritual base, abundant clean air, low stress, very strong family support and several other factors that all contribute toward a long and healthy life. It’s more than just the food they eat or don’t eat but that certainly plays a role.I look forward to Dr G’s forthcoming book.TomTom & Thea, here is the link to the more recent info on AHS2: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23836264It actually shows that Pesco-vegitarians may be more healthy than Vegans.Here is another Paper “Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans?1,2,3http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/526S.long Both of these ideas are somewhat more supportive of the diet in these Blue Zones vs being a Vegan.I think it is important to note that a quality of a vegan diet can range significantly. A processed food vegan cannot be accurately compared with a whole foods plant based low fat vegan.These are 2 different animals.How many centenarians are or were vegans/vegetarians?Just a quick note, I saw that all the studies you mention were about vegetarians, but you comment about it as if the studies were done on vegans, like:“So if eating eggs, meat and other animal foods is so dangerous to health, then non-vegans should be dropping like flies at much earlier ages. Despite what we might like to philosophically or morally believe, the facts prove this simply is not the case.”Vegetarian in those studies are ovolacto vegetarians — and you can bet a few among them who also ate fish and still called themselves “vegetarians”, simply because they didn’t eat meat, but eat ALL other animal products.Vegans were such a tiny number that didn’t have any studies done until later.I read about the blue zones and the fact that they are consuming fish and they live longer at a comment below. That is partially true. This is not (the only reason) why people from Ikaria for example, live so long. First of all, they consume vegetables, and legumes mostly, and not so much read meat. They use olive oil to cook and not margarines and stuff like that. They drink red wine, they move, and then we have Vitamine D (we have loads of sunny days :)). We do not like the McDonalds. I know the post might be irrelevant to the subject of the video but I just wanted to answer to that comment. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/magazine/the-island-where-people-forget-to-die.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&amp;hey Dr Greger, what do you think of carbonated drinks?like caffeine free sodas, non alcoholic sweet malts, gassy water. trying to use them to get more carbs in.Are you saying that you would be calorie deficient without drinking these things? Why do you think it’s a good idea to consume empty calories?not deficient but would like to eat more, I know I know have natural juice, malt seems like a plant based low fat, kinda wholefood. I was thinking about some alternatives to plain water or fuit juice or coffee. im curious because maybe the carbonation makes the drink too acid, so that offsets the benefits of the drink.No matter how hard the egg administration tries to twist science, no matter how much they argue, no matter how loud the yell, no matter how hard they try to ignore dr. Greger (and Toxins!) – the fact remains: Eggs are a very unhealthy food…..the only positive thing you can say about eggs is that it promotes discussion….but at the same promotes atherosclerosis…..It’s not the egg, bacon, or butter that raises cholesterol, but rather the vegan muffin, pancake, waffle, hash brown, syrup, sugar in the coffee, and fruit juices in the morning.does this mean my egg beaters are not so good for me???Dan Jackson, Short answer: Stay away from anything containing any real egg, including egg beaters. There are two problems with eggs, the yolk and the white. (To paraphrase Dr. Barnard.)Long answer: According to Wikipedia, here is what is in egg beaters: “”Egg Beaters is primarily egg whites with added flavorings, vitamins, and thickeners xanthan gum and guar gum. It contains no egg yolks.”Since egg beaters do not have egg yolks, the cholesterol issue is not in play. But egg whites are just as bad for you. Dr. Barnard talks about the problems that animal protein presents for kidney health. Other experts talk about the (strong in my opinion) link between animal protein and cancer. The question scientists then want to answer is: Is there a causal link? If so, what is the mechanism by which animal protein might cause cancer?If memory serves, Dr Campbell in The China Study mentions several ways in which we think that animal protein causes and promotes cancer. Here on NutritionFacts, you can get a great education on how animal protein is linked to the body’s over-production of a growth hormone called IGF-1. IGF-1 helps cancer to grow. To watch the series about IGF-1, click on the link below and then keep clicking the “next video” link on the button to the right until you get through the bodybuilding video. Then you will have seen the entire series. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/And Darryl recently reminded me about the methionine issue. Egg whites have *the* highest concentration of methionine of any food: http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-000084000000000000000.html?categories=1,18,9,0,13,14,5,4,42,16,17,15,6,3,2,11,7,19,21,12,10,8,22 Dr. Greger did a nice video showing the link between methionine and cancer. So, now you know two clear pathways linking animal proteins, especially egg whites, to cancer. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/Darryl also pointed out that, “…high methionine diets increase coronary risk in humans. In its associations with cardiovascular disease and other disorders, homocysteine may be functioning partly as a marker for the major culprit, excess methionine.” http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475305001092And while I can’t find it right now, I believe that Toxins has pointed out some other health issues with egg whites.With all of the information we have about the harmful effects of animal protein in general and egg white in particular, I think it’s best to stay away from egg white. Why not get your protein from safe sources? Sources which are known to have lots of positive health effects and will naturally give you a balanced amount of protein? (ie: whole plant foods) Make sense?Thank you so much for such a detailed answer….very appreciated…danThanks very much. I’m keeping a copy of these concise answers to forward to those who (as I used to) figure they’ve found a loophole to continue eating animal products without the risk. In my view the info presented by this NFteam is literally adding many healthy years to readers lives. Tell me where you live and I’ll come mow your lawn … soon.Coacervate: I don’t deserve any credit here. I’m basically just repeating what others have put together, especially Toxins and Darryl. But when I have the time, I do try to answer this particular question, because it comes up *all* the time. And understandably so. People deserve an answer.I’m so happy I helped more than one person with this answer!I’m basically just repeating what others have put together,” … Thats what we all do. except the lab boffins. Some are honest and some are just making it up as they go along. Those are the most dangerous of all!Agree. Thea is too humble. Thea adds value to this site.I agree that following a low-fat, plant-based diet is no guarantee that you will have a low or acceptable triglyceride level. But triglyceride levels can be controlled by selection of certain plant foods and rejection of others. Reject refined foods such as flours and white rice, empty calorie sugars, fruit juices. and smoothies. Some people may also have to restrict whole fruit consumption. Select foods that tend to keep triglyceride levels low, such as beans, lentils, and greens. Some people may benefit from getting most of their calorie intake from these three foods plus other vegetables, and a starch-resistant whole grain such as dark teff. Avoid less starch-resistant grains like regular corn and wheat. It would also be interesting to explore the practice of taking an amla tablet with each meal, along with a few nuts such as walnuts, and some potato starch. Potato starch, though it looks like a taboo, white, refined food, isn’t anything like potato flour; it has one of the highest starch resistant compositions of any food, and might be useful in regulating both blood sugar and triglycerides. Esselystn tells everyone to eat more legumes and greens, and he is absolutely right. The whole field of starch-resistant plant foods needs more investigation.In the website run by Dr. Ben Kim, a Canadian Chiropractor (who, while not a Vegan, advocates a diet based primarily on plant products – http://drbenkim.com/) I encountered a comment he made saying that the problem with cholesterol in eggs is eliminated (or at least reduced) by eating (infrequently) organic eggs cooked without their being subjected to high heat. Specifically he says that it is subjecting the cholesterol to high heat in the cooking process that produces the adverse effects. He recommends a Korean dish made by steaming eggs. This is would also appear to apply as well to the “65 degree” egg – that’s Celsius -, cooked for a long time at 65 degrees (150 Fahrenheit). This produces solid white and liquid yolk. They are delicious, but I now longer eat animal products. I wonder if somebody can comment on the underlying claims.Well, did he provide some sort of citation for this claim? If not I might presume that he’s just blowing steam in the way of keeping his customer base broad.Hello Judas Priest,I think what Dr. Kim is trying to get at is that oxidized cholesterol does not cause problems, although I have not seen any direct research showing the effects of low heat cooking on cholesterol oxidation. Regardless, oxidized cholesterol is not required for plaques to form, nor is inflammation. Inflammation certainly accelerates the process, but it is not the only thing that matters in the development of plaques. It has been shown that non oxidized LDL also constitutes plaque. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2877120/And also nonoxidized LDL typically precedes oxidized LDL in plaque formation.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1850639/I think its also interesting to note that saturated fat alone may produce inflammatory byproducts by your gut bacteria, thus influencing the level of oxidized cholesterol in the blood.“In a comprehensive literature review, we show that the body preferentially upregulates inflammation in response to saturated FA that promote harmful microbes. In contrast, the host often reduces inflammation in response to the many unsaturated FA with antimicrobial properties.”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22970557Consuming unoxidized cholesterol will still increase serum cholesterol if your baseline is not already high.“Serum cholesterol concentration is clearly increased by added dietary cholesterol but the magnitude of predicted change is modulated by baseline dietary cholesterol. The greatest response is expected when baseline dietary cholesterol is near zero, while little, if any, measurable change would be expected once baseline dietary cholesterol was >400-500 mg/d. People desiring maximal reduction of serum cholesterol by dietary means may have to reduce their dietary cholesterol to minimal level”http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/55/6/1060.full.pdfFor these reasons, I don’t think it is supported by the evidence that eggs cooked on low heat are any healthier then eggs cooked normally.I know of one man who understood on an intellectual level that he was not making the lifestyle changes required to be healthy, but kept putting it off or backsliding. How could this one plate of eggs bacon sausage and spam hurt? Then he had the attack, the bypass, the recurring nightmare of angina. Then his understanding became more …. heart-felt. He’s doing so much better now that he got that click in his head. He that said the pleasure trap just ain’t worth it. I see him every morning when I brush my teeth.It is not easy for some to break their addiction. I had to adjust. The chopping up of the first steamed kale and potato casserole was a little difficult. After that it was just like spittin … now the angina is gone, the IBS(!), the weird mood swings, the joint/muscle pain. Just try it for a month and find out for yourself who is talking sense. WHOLE PLANT FOODS.You are living proof !! Hope you brush your teeth in the evening too :-) There is a link between poor dental health and heart disease (probably inflammation)Thanks PSDoc…message received and understood.Fernandez “chickened out” !!Can you please restore the transcript function which no longer works since the introduction of your new format.

Thanks for helping us perfect the new site!So are egg whites “only” just as bad or is the yolk the culprit?Egg whites are about 95% protein and very little fat. They shouldn’t be a problem from a cholesterol stand point but intake of protein especially animal protein is a problem over the long run. There are over 60 video’s relating to protein… you might start with http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-animal-protein-restriction/.ifdmike: There are two problems with eggs, the yolk and the white.

Thanks again.Cappy228: Glad I could help.re: Baking. Have you experimented with “Flax eggs”? For recipes that call for 1 or 2 eggs, “flax eggs” work very, very well as a substitution. Then, not only would you be avoiding the problems with egg whites, but you would be gaining the great benefits of eating flax.A flax egg is typically described something like this: mix 1 tablespoon well-ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water. Let sit for 5-10 minutes. I think I’ve seen recommendations about using warm water. But other times, I have seen recommendations about putting the mixture in the fridge for those say 10 minutes. And other times nothing is mentioned about temperature.I think it is worth playing around with.Thea, is there a problem with all those sensitive omega 3s in flax oxidizing when exposed to heat?Harriet: I believe that Dr. Greger has a video which addresses heat and flax, but I couldn’t find it. I’m not sure that video 100% answers your question anyway. I was able to find a post from someone else named “Jean” some time ago. She wrote:“Fortunately, the omega-3 in ground flaxseeds have been shown to remain unaffected when exposed to temperatures of up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, as part of a muffin mix, for two hours. http://www.livestrong.com/article/394798-can-we-cook-ground-flaxseed/ Found several web sites that say this same information but none of them sited who researched this.”So, I don’t know if this is true or not. If you find the actual study which says this, let me know. :-)Please help me with this problem. I went vegan Sept. 1, 2014, following the McDougall and Eselstyn eating plan. I had blood drawn 9-16-14 and my total cholesterol was 166. I was excited to try and get it to ‘heart attack proof’ of 150 or lower. I received my new blood report yesterday, 11-18-14 and my new Total Cholesterol number is now 191!!! WHat?!! I am SOOO discouraged and confused. I have been cooking totally differently without oils, eating more beans, greens and grains than ever. How can it go up? I can’t find ANY info on a vegan diet making the cholesterol rise. My naturopath told me it’s fine and not to worry about it. That it’s just my body balancing to its natural number. I can’t trust this after all the lectures I’ve watched over a lower cholesterol number and I am perplexed. Thank you for any help given.VeganMatrix: Well dang. Most of the time people experience only healthy outcomes of switching to the diets recommended by McDougall and Esselstyn (WFPB = whole food plant based). And as you describe, it sure sounds like you are sticking to that diet. So, your results are not just confusing, but sure to be frustrating.I’m not a doctor, but I have three thoughts for you. 1) incorrect results – it is possible that one or both of the tests you took gave you wrong numbers. What if your initial test was wrong and now you are lower than you were? Or what if this latest test is just wrong? Did you do a fasting test each time so that the results are comparable? Did they use the same lab for both tests? I raise this as a suggestion because, like you, I don’t remember ever hearing of a WFPB diet making someone’s cholesterol worse. So, maybe your are special (yeah? ;-) ) or maybe the tests are wrong.2) Are you losing weight? I may be incorrect on this, but I have the idea in my head that when you are in the process of losing weight, it can mess with your numbers.3) Is two and a half months enough time to really evaluate? I don’t think your naturopath’s idea of your body finding it’s natural number makes sense if your cholesterol really did go up. But on the other hand, maybe it is natural (just a wild guess here!) to have some fluctuations during a transition (which you are still in in my opinion) and after some time (don’t know how much!) you will get closer to that 150 mark. ???I really don’t know. Those are just some ideas. On the proactive side, I highly recommend taking a look at the following link. You should be able to use the foods listed at the bottom to tweak your current WFPB diet in order to maximize cholesterol lowering. http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/Hope that helps.sorry for the wrong spelling- Esselstyn!Thea: Thank you very much for you response since this has me completely perplexed and discouraged. I spent the month of August vacationing overseas and it was a time of indulgence. I went from 123 lbs to 127 lbs ( 41 yr old, female, 5’3 inches) I decided upon arriving home to start a plant based diet. Spending hours watching NF videos, Esselstyn/Caldwell Lectures, and watching plant-based chefs. I stir-fry in water, eat lots of rice/veggies, vegan chili/stews, grains and started consuming lots of potatoes/root vegetables. During this time, I upped my coffee/espresso intake (4-6 a day) since my circumstance provides all the free coffee bar drinks I want. Could that be the culprit alone? The new foods I transitioned with are Gardein products (2-3x per week), soy milk daily, tofu 1-2x per week. I cut out the use of eggs, dairy, butter – but use rationed amounts of vegenaise, earth balance 1-2x per week. I have no idea…1. I have lost the weight gained over my vacation month and am down to 122 lbs. I run 3x per week usually on a treadmill making sure I complete 3.2 miles each time.2. The first test was a preventative to see my baselines from my ob-gyn. The second testing was from a different office (naturopath). Maybe one did it wrong? I am so concerned and discouraged it might be worth paying to have it drawn again but I don’t want to waste money having it done too soon. Should I wait two months, keep eating WFPB but risk another jump in numbers?3. I have read online (Harvard website) that some people turn carbohydrates in glucose quickly and it raises their triglycerides too much? Should I go back to more condensed forms of protein (animal products and lower the complex carbs) Although the idea of eating animal products is traumatizing to me, now that I’ve taken in so much information. I am truly at a loss on how to proceed. The thought of my cholesterol jumping 25 points in 2 months is terrifying to me. Especially since my husband ( who’s family is rampant with heart disease) and my 4-year old eat the same way. Am I harming my health and my family’s health in a misguided attempt to be healthier?Once again, thank you for listening and responding. It feels better to atleast type this frustration out!VeganMatrix: That coffee question is interesting. I had never heard of a link between coffee and cholesterol before, but your post prompted me to do a quick search. It turns out, there is some evidence of a link. I don’t generally follow Dr. Weil, because I think a lot of his information isn’t that good, but this page seems pretty helpful: http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/QAA401225/Does-Coffee-Raise-Cholesterol.htmlSo, it depends on the type of coffee. And also note this sentence which I think is key: “They found no relationship between the amount of coffee the study subjects consumed and an increased risk of death from any cause, including cancer or cardiovascular disease.”Note that our NutritionFacts.org site generally has positive things to say about coffee. (But far more positive things to say about green tea. So, if you can make the switch, that’s even healthier.)Your diet is not perfect, but it sure is a million times better than most people’s diet. So, my lay person’s gut feeling is that your current diet would not contribute to cholesterol raising above what your previous diet was.I do think it is key that you likely had the two tests done at different labs. And also I think it is key to try to remember what time of day the two tests were done. It’s my understanding that cholesterol levels can change over the course of a day – especially after eating. While we may live most of our lives in a post-prandial (after meal) state, I would think that one would have to do fasting cholesterol tests in order to be able to compare results from two different test. I may be wrong about that, but if I’m right and if your second test was not done say in the morning before breakfast, it could be really hard to compare results of the two test – if they are even right.Since you are so stressed about this, I would suggest doing something to ease your mind now rather than waiting. But if you at all can, I would go back to the ob-gyn because that is where you got your baseline.I would also want to make sure that when you were given both numbers, they were talking about the same thing. Were both numbers from the tests about total cholesterol? Can you double-check?Triglycerides is different than cholesterol. It is a different type of fat. If your cholesterol levels went up, that doesn’t tell you what happened to your triglycerides. Also, I would think that there is no way that adding cholesterol back into your diet would help lower cholesterol. So, there is no reason to traumatize yourself with adding unhealthy food back into your diet.I think you should be proud of what you have accomplished so far. See if you can get another test with the same lab as the first one. If waiting won’t be too big of a burden, it might help to wait so that you have some real time to see differences. If the third test shows you are right in line or just below the second test, then you would have some pretty good evidence that your current diet is not causing your cholesterol to continue to spiral through the roof. And it may show that the first test was just a freak, wrong test. Or it may be that the third test is right in line with the first, indicating that the second test was wrong… I think you just need more data before making decisions.That’s my 2 cents. I hope you will report back and let us know how it went.Thea, once again THANK YOU for having compassion for my question and giving me a better perspective! I took a deep breath and decided that it is too little information to make any adjustments back toward cholesterol-laden foods. The coffee connection is interesting. All coffee I drink comes from a french press, so I will start cutting back now. Thanks for the link. I am going to keep trying to learn the WFPB recipes and tweak our diets away from the vegan transitional foods. I think I left some really healthy habits (although I was consuming animal products) I think I have used more ‘vegan junk foods’ than is advised. (vegenaise, earth balance) I am going to cut back on all of that. I feel so much less inflammation in my body and no longer need pain relievers on a regular basis. Also my digestion has been working better than ever. My skin looks great and the lymph nodes in my neck are not swollen for the first time that I can remember! With those benefits I can’t see going backwards just b/c of some cholesterol tests. Neither one of the tests showed the differentials just TOTAL Cholesterol number. (both were fasting tests, but different times of day, with different amounts of time- 15 hours of fasting on 1st, 11 hours of fasting on 2nd) I am going to give it a few more months and test again with the 1st lab. Thanks again for all your time and thoughtfulness in your responses. Happy Vegan Thanksgiving to you and yours! ;)Can you believe this video from the Discovery channel?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhFbsvb2jbQThey even used a study from Maria Fernandez in the video (1:29).DNews usually does a great job on their research. What a disappointment…I have heard many people say that eggs and especially egg whites are good for us. You clearly show why whole eggs are bad but how do I answer the egg white issue?schki: Here is what I share with people when they ask about egg whites:There are two problems with eggs, the yolk and the white. (To paraphrase Dr. Barnard.)With egg whites, the cholesterol issue is not in play. But egg whites are just as bad for you. Dr. Barnard talks about the problems that animal protein presents for kidney health. Other experts talk about the (strong in my opinion) link between animal protein and cancer. The question scientists then want to answer is: Is there a causal link? If so, what is the mechanism by which animal protein might cause cancer?If memory serves, Dr Campbell in The China Study mentions several ways in which we think that animal protein causes and promotes cancer. Here on NutritionFacts, you can get a great education on how animal protein is linked to the body’s over-production of a growth hormone called IGF-1. IGF-1 helps cancer to grow.

Then you will have seen the entire series. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/And Darryl recently reminded me about the methionine issue. Egg whites have *the* highest concentration of methionine of any food: http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-000084000000000000000.html?categories=1,18,9,0,13,14,5,4,42,16,17,15,6,3,2,11,7,19,21,12,10,8,22 Dr. Greger did a nice video showing the link between methionine and cancer. So, there are two clear pathways linking animal proteins, especially egg whites, to cancer. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/Darryl also pointed out that, “…high methionine diets increase coronary risk in humans. In its associations with cardiovascular disease and other disorders, homocysteine may be functioning partly as a marker for the major culprit, excess methionine.” http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475305001092And while I can’t find it right now, I believe that Toxins has pointed out two other health issues with egg whites.With all of the information we have about the harmful effects of animal protein in general and egg white in particular, I think it’s best to stay away from egg white. Why not get your protein from safe sources? Sources which are known to have lots of positive health effects and will naturally give you a balanced amount of protein? (ie: whole plant foods) Make sense?THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS! I really appreciate the time you took to answer it and all the amazing information that you all put out! I will share this with others and again THANK YOU!Dr. Greger,The liver regulates cholesterol and provides the amount that we need, so how can cholesterol have this detrimental of an effect if the liver regulates it? I am confused as to the physiology behind this. As an aside, I am a vegeterian and eat 3 eggs a day, so I don’t want to believe this is true, but am willing to change my ways.Thanks,Josh S.Is there a health argument against egg “whites”? As a vegan, I get asked this question a lot. Thanks!JR: Egg whites are just as bad for you. Dr. Barnard talks about the problems that animal protein presents for kidney health.

I’m not sure if that applies to egg whites or not. And the search feature in NutritionFacts is not working right now. But hopefully you can find it yourself if you are interested.Hope that helps!Did you see in the most recent addition of the “AARP Bulletin” April 2015 Vol. 56 page 15 under the title Health Shots They say that eating eggs and shellfish is OK for healthy people to eat?Hi Peggy. No I did not see that. Feel free to post a link or any references if you’d like and I can investigate more. Some info on shellfish can be found here and here. And eggs if interested.

No, I think the opposite is true. We do not “hate” any research and we are glad when people post studies on our website.Had my blood test done and a bit disappointed with my cholesterol levels. My triglyceride was 89.4 (I think that is good). My LDL is 105.7(I think that is good) Total Cholesterol is 151.2 (also ok I think) BUT my HDL was only 40.5 (I think that is bad/way to low). I’ve been all plant based for 2 years with lots of greens and raw fruit and veggies, nut and seeds. I walk over 90 minutes every day and I’m not at all over weight (5 foot 6 and 120 pounds).

What a way to start my day.Can someone help me find some studies that correlate cholesterol to risk of heart attacks?The correlation is stronger for plasma cholesterol than dietary cholesterol: Blood cholesterol and vascular mortality by age, sex, and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of individual data from 61 prospective studies with 55,000 vascular deaths. You may want a cholesterol converter to convert the international units to the American mg/dl convention. In most diets, the LDL raising trans- and saturated fats (myristate, palmitate, laurate) have a greater effect on plasma cholesterol that than cholesterol from the diet, however for those achieving plasma cholesterol in the “heart attack proof” range (< 150 mg/dl, < 3.9 mmol/l) with low-fat plant-based diets, ""modest amounts of dietary cholesterol added to a cholesterol-free diet would be expected to most efficiently elevate serum cholesterol“.Outstanding work Darryl, thank you. I need this info for skeptical friends/family who have “locked on” to the misinformation about dietary cholesterol.One question… in Paul Hopkin’s review figure 1 shows a model that predicts the increase in serum concentration as a function of dietary cholesterol. For example at the 500 mg/d ingestion level there is a predicted concentration of about 0.5 mmolar. But even if all 500 mg went into a volume of say 5 l of blood that would correspond to about 0.25 mM. Am I misinterpreting their model?Fig 1 illustrates the mathematical model Hopkins used. Actual estimates from experimental data are in Fig 2. My calculations are the same as yours. The 27 experiments Hopkins is estimating parameters from were generally multi-day controlled feeding trials in metabolic wards. Ie, “if 500 mg/d cholesterol (in pills) was added to a baseline 300 mg/d cholesterol diet over a week (or longer), how much would blood cholesterol change compared to baseline diet only”. We’d have to track down the individual studies to determine the actual durations.Begs the question, “Where does the extra cholesterol come from?” Does it seem likely that ingestion stimulates greater production too? Wouldn’t that be an obvious and glaring problem to them and their model?As always Darryl, everyone here on NF.org values your contributions. Thank you!Triglycerides, however, are from diet, are they not? From too much refined carbohydrates.. and even just from grain?The covariance of triglycerides with other CVD risk factors make them [not particularly useful](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3284229/) as clinical predictors.. However, more recent Mendelian randomization studies confirm a causal role, particularly for non-fasting/post-prandial triglycerides, though weaker than that for LDL (1, 2, 3).Sugars, high-glycemic index starches, alcohol, and health conditions like obesity, diabetes, liver or kidney disease can all contribute to elevated triglycerides. So, yes, refined carbs contribute. On the other hand, insoluble fiber, like that in beans and whole grains reduce both glycemic index and triglycerides in human trials, and are both consistently associated with lower risk from a variety of diseases. On balance I think starches remain the safest source for the bulk of calories, but I try to eat the whole grain/bean/tuber with the fiber, rather than refined products. My weakness is white rice, but my trigs are well within the normal range (< 150 mg/dL).The physicians I work (except one) don’t care about patients enough to encourage them to eat healthier. Sad but true. I have been at my current practice for over one year and we even created a professionally edited video of our patients that have reversed there diabetes, obesity, erectile dysfunction, hypertension etc. They (the docs) have read the evidence, and seen the incredible results but still the docs look at me and the dietitian like Deer in the Headlights. One of the physicians still explains, “Remember, those sick patients pay our bills.” Absolutely ludicrous, I say!This goes out to everyone that keeps this website functioning: Keep up the great work!Thanks for the insiders perspective (though now I have to be even a wee bit more cynical ! :-)). It seems to me that big ag and big pharma happily profit from a generally unhealthy population but I naively assumed that most docs were victims stuck in the middle, trying to help their patients but overwhelmed by corporate influence. I guess it’s a little more nuanced than that…In nearly thirty years of practice I have never heard a colleague make a comment like that. If I wanted to work twice the hours I could easily have twice the number of patients. The insinuation that physicians intentionally keep patients sick to increase business is “absolutely ludicrous.”You are a statistic of one, as is the one doc that Hemo referenced. She did not insinuate that ALL physicians intentionally keep patients sick to increase business. And you may not think like that and are well within your right to believe that most don’t, but don’t you insinuate that none do because that would be a ludicrous assertion./What RappFan said. For over 30 years I have heard my dr’s say: “Diabetics are babies” (referring to my complaint about fatigue), another said that it was “all in your imagination” in reference to other complaints. NOT ONE even hinted that I could TRY changing to a whole foods, plant-based diet as pioneered by real physicians like Kempner, Ornish, Pritikin, Esselstyn, Campbell et al. Rather, they all got in line to dope me up, slice me up and collect the cash. Wake up and smell the…erm… absolutely watercress.“The insinuation that physicians intentionally keep patients sick to increase business is ‘absolutely ludicrous.'”Interestingly, that is what I used to think as well.Dr Hemo you work with a bunch of slugs!I think it is more complicated then they just don’t care. They don’t know any better is probably more accurate. They don’t believe patients will change or they themselves eat like that and don’t exercise. It is practically impossible for a doctor to sell a patient on a WFPB diet and exercise with a fat tire around their waist and a hamburger in one hand!I have great luck with my patients. It takes time and I can’t put any pressure on them but little by little they drop the animal and start to exercise more.I feel for you….you must be so frustrated!It really is that bad! And it’s not even about the WFPB lifestyle thing. I don’t know if some of the physicians I work with have lost compassion for human beings, have ever had compassion or really just don’t care. It’s a trip to experience.I’m not frustrated (OK maybe a little) but getting burnt out quickly. I’m one of only two physicians that sees anyone who comes through the door. Heroin addict, drug abusers/malingerers, suicidal patients, acute psychosis, morbid obesity, non-compliant diabetics (I call them Limb losers), chronic pain with no desire to change. I even have a patient that tried to cut off his leg with a chain saw. It’s like I work in an ER/Psych Hospital but in an outpatient setting and even though I leave work at work it is mentally draining.We have two physicians who refuse to see those kinds of patients–they cherry pick! And they probably do that because it is so draining. I have asked them why they cherry pick but they deny it. I even had a Medical Assistant trainee recently, who has worked with all the doctors there, that asked why I see all the difficult, complex and psychiatric case patients? They asked if those are the patients I liked to see. Spontaneously I told them, “Have you ever seen a toilet?” they stared at me somewhat perplexed, I said, “That’s me.” My Nurse just busted up laughing with tears running down their face. Why? Because they saw the truth in that statement–I get dumped on. But hey, the patients need to be seen and if I don’t see them who else is going to.Regardless, when I get a patient who is interested in getting off their medication I seize the moment and when I see them change and their diseases stop or even reverse that is what motivates me to keep going; it’s hard, however, to keep making water when you are in the middle of a fire!My previous private practice was the same way with doctors. One of them would always be late to office management meeting by over 20 minutes and he would do the same to patients. And if the patient complained about having to wait so long he would go to his office and make them wait longer or go see his next patient first just to make them wait even longer! Happened nearly everyday for the two years I worked there. We had another doc at that practice that if the patient questioned the doctor at all he would kick them out of the practice! Really!!!! If the patient came to see me and wanted to switch providers, he would kick them out of the practice. His practice was mostly very compliant chronic pain patients. The reality is quite a few of the physicians I have been around have taught me there are a lot of unhappy doctors out there.I’m sharing this with you not for any empathy or sympathy but just to give you a glimpse into the crazy world of medicine.Hemodynamic: Every time I see your posts, I cheer. You are one of the good guys.But also sometimes when I see your posts, I not only get quite an interesting education about medical care, but I feel bad for you, because I know you are in such a difficult situation. I wanted to share with you the following article about a plant-based doctor who got burnt out and decided to tackle the situation in a unique way. I think there are a couple of articles about this doctor on the web and she has her own website. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/29/the-health-care-system-is-so-broken-it-s-time-for-doctors-to-strike.html http://www.idealmedicalcare.org/dr-wible.phpShe even has physician retreats: http://www.petgoatsandpapsmears.com/teleclass.phpMaybe this will help/inspire you in some way. You are such a valuable poster on this site! Thanks for your participation.Hey Thea I just saw your post ;(. Guess I should check my inbox on Discus more often. Your words are very kind and appreciated!After rereading my post I feel like I came across as probably a “down and out” burned out. But I’m not! I live my doctor life at work like the docs in M.A.S.H. (the old TV show) BJ Honneycut and Hawkeye Pierce– with a lot of humor. Oh, OK, and a Martini every once in awhile. :-)I’ll give you an example. When I was on one of my surgical rotations in residency I rounded with a very skilled 40 year surgeon who had an interesting side of humor. We performed a hemorrhoidectomy on another 70 year old Family Medicine doc (his friend). When he was done we glued a rhinestone butterfly to his left butt cheek.Medicine is kinda like a secret society and I like to let people look inside and see the real doings in medicine–The funny and the sad.I hope that made you smile. ;0Thanks for the links!Oh yes, I’m smiling big right now. :-) !!I loved M.A.S.H, so I know exactly what you are talking about. Wow, that brings back some good memories.I’m so glad/relieved to hear that things are not as bad with you as they sounded. Whew. Keep up the good work! I always love your posts. They make me smile.When you deal with people on illegal drugs and alcohol often, it’s a quick burnout. Perhaps a change of venue would be good… the rest of us need doctors like you, too.Hemodynamic, I’d love to give you a big hug! You give the kind of medical care that I admire in a doctor. I do hope that you can find a way for your practice to be more sustainable for you. You studied so long and so hard, and invested so much in becoming and continuing to be a doctor. You deserve to enjoy the work that you do without feeling like you are burning out. Yes, your workload is unfair and you are a better doctor for seeing the challenging patients that you do, but your work-life must be full of joy too. I don’t know if your workload is too heavy, but that could be adding to your sense of burnout. I think the references from Thea are an option to consider, as well as taking a course in caretaker burnout (prevention, etc.), which many healthcare workers from many different disciplines suffer from. You are not alone. I think everyone here wishes you the best in dealing with your stressful role at work.Thank you! I appreciate your kind words. See my post above to Thea.What I find particularly shocking is that bariatric surgeons are willing to put their patients on a lifelong diet that provides them with virtually no choice. That is to say, they are only allowed to eat 1/2 to one cup of food per meal. I suspect most patients would prefer to eat until they feel full. Why don’t MD’s (GP’s in particular) prescribe a whole foods, plant-based diet? Why wouldn’t this be the first line of recommendation for patients seeking bypass operations? In Canada, where the system pays, it would save a lot of taxpayer money to go the dietary route, and the patient’s quality of life would be so much better afterwards. In theory, health professionals are required to discuss risks, benefits and alternatives of their proposed treatments. Something isn’t getting through to this population. Perhaps the WFPBD researchers/MDs should be presenting their results at Bariatric surgery conventions. Maybe it is starting to happen, but I’d sure like to hear about it if these specialists are being educated on the safety and cost-effectiveness of appropriate and effective dietary treatments. FYI, Mayo clinic suggestions for post-bypass diet is here: http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bariatric-surgery/in-depth/gastric-bypass-diet/art-20048472Cardiologist approved and applauded. Thanks Dr Greger, send to every medical student and hospital administratorI eat only whole-food plant-based food at age 72 and feel good all the time, ride my bike, and walk, instead of driving.I’m a 3rd year medical student and I’d have to agree that medical nutrition training is abysmal. I had one nutrition lecture in biochemistry which consisted of a rundown on the essential vitamins. As for diet the professor said “make sure you eat a healthy diet”.What do your peers say about the lack of attention to medical nutrition? Is the word spreading among the “new guard” at all?Believe me dear Sidney that if you’re going to have a “Do It Yourself” Nutrition degree (of course with sites like NF, or others like http://thescienceofnutrition.wordpress.com/ ) you’re going to help a LOT of people and by the way maybe after you’re a licensed doctor, you can decide to specialize in Human Nutrition (a master degree i think)… or join the Ornish Spectrum: http://ornishspectrum.com/site-certification/#section_training-certification :-)I’m an RMT in Canada (2200 hour program), graduated in 2008. Even back in my day, we had a 24 hour course in which we had to keep and analyse a 1 week food diary, studied micronutrients, macronutrients, fibre types, essential fatty acids, anti-oxidants and phyto-nutrients. It is outside our scope of practise to prescribe anything to eat – we can’t even tell people to drink water (we can tell them to keep hydrated though). I am really shocked that your med school doesn’t have more training in nutrition, given how important it is to a person’s health and given the obesity epidemic. If you are brave, I would encourage you to address this issue with the Dean of your program. It’s a huge gap in the curriculum. Perhaps you have other colleagues who can also realize the importance of nutritional education and together you can petition the Dean.i would like to know if fat free cottage cheese is ok to eat inasmuch as one serving contains 0 Fat, 0 trans fat, 10mg cholest., 15g protein and 5g carb?? thank youit would be better without it of course but it wont hurt you much especially in moderate amount and if you have a plant based diet~I think this question is best answered by looking up videos on this site about milk products, allergies they produce, impacts on disease, like arthritis, dementia, asthma, ear infections, sinus problems and especially increased risks for prostate cancer (most recent video on this was posted not long ago). Someone else’s belief that it isn’t that bad is no substitute for you looking at the risks and deciding for yourself if you want to consume it. For example, in contrast, I will never again knowingly put dairy in my body. I encourage to do a few minutes of research and decide for yourself the level of risk you want to assume.Go to Trader Joes and get organic cottage cheese… I believe it’s live culture.My my husband has been on a WFPBD for more than a year, yet his total cholesterol is around 230 with a very bad ratio LDL and HDL. Do you have any suggestion. Is he doomed to take pillsI think this is an excellent article. It gets to the problem so many people are curious about when going to a plant-based diet. Why doesn’t my doctor recommend a plant-based diet when my cholesterol is high? I will have to stop eating all the junk foods that I like so much! How will I be satisfied when I can’t eat these foods any longer? These are the reasons so many people don’t move to a plant-based diet. I personally have found that I feel better eating a whole foods plant based diet. There is no question. My LDL cholesterol has gone from around 200 to just over 160. I feel better. I don’t have cravings for junk food. Though I still have some ‘food coma’ after lunch, I feel my energy level does not have the same high and low swings that it used to have. I also used to deal with chronic fatigue and dysthemia, both of which have vastly improved since I’ve gone on this healthier diet. People sometimes make fun of the food I eat, sometimes calling it bird food (and I can laugh about it too). The fact is, I feel better now; I have no reason to go back to how I used to eat (SAD- standard american diet). In my humble opinion, not eating a plant-based diet is foolish. The other thing is that it’s not hard to make vegetarian food taste good. In fact I don’t really like tofu–my body finds it difficult to digest– so I don’t eat that much of it. There are plenty of other things to choose from and ways to season them. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, leafy greens–these all taste good naturally and with very little seasoning required. It may take some time for your taste to adjust to the new diet. But you won’t look back once you’ve made the decision to go plant based. It’s a win-win in so many ways.Sorry Esther, I meant for this to be a general post–not as a reply to your post. I do have some questions for you. Do you know how much oil/fat your husband is consuming? I know you said he’s eating whole foods and plant based. So the question is, “is he getting saturated fats from the preparation of these foods?” If the diet is solid- no excess of fats or oils in the preparation- and it is truly plant based, then there appears to be another process at work undermining his efforts. I wish I knew more to tell you. From what I’ve seen and read, very few cardiac (heart-unhealthy) patients don’t improve on a plant based diet. Don’t give up looking for the answer. JThank you. I am positive. No saturated fíats, no industrialized food, just a few drops once in a while of olive oil, around 12 to 15 pecans a week, and yes 1/2 avocado almost every day. The rest of our daily intake is : around three pieces of fruit with granola and flaxseed on almond milk, lunch is made up of veggies, chickpeas, lentils, etc, quinoa and maybe a salad. Dinner could be a fresh greens wrap, a vegetable sándwich a bowl of beans. Or some hummus. Lots of hibbiscus, green tea, no sugar fresh lemmons lemmonade. Any suggestions????Dang, that sounds incredibly healthy to me! I know that’s not terribly helpful in regards to your problem. I just wanted to take a moment to celebrate what you have accomplished. I aspire to do as well you two have. I sure hope you can figure out the cholesterol issue . Good luck!Has your husband ever had his thyroid evaluated? Has he lost any weight since going plant-based? Does he exercise? Being hypothyroid can cause high cholesterol levels until proper hormone levels are established. Exercise can help increase HDL leading to a better ratio. I would consider having the thyroid evaluated and maybe the liver. I definitely wouldn’t give up on being plant-based, though. What a fantastic accomplishment. I hope you get to the bottom of the issue.The rate and extent of recovery varies. If you want to be even more aggressive, possibly ditch the granola, almond milk and lower the fats.Exercise?I do have some questions for you. Do you know how much oil/fat your husband is consuming? I know you said he’s eating whole foods and plant based. So the question is, “is he getting saturated fats from the preparation of these foods?” If the diet is solid- no excess of fats or oils in the preparation- and it is truly plant based, then there appears to be another process at work undermining his efforts. I wish I knew more to tell you. From what I’ve seen and read, very few cardiac (heart-unhealthy) patients don’t improve on a plant based diet. Don’t give up looking for the answer. JAnd yes. We feel much better. Some issues have improved, not high cholesterol. We would never go back to SADYou might try reading Dr. John McDougall’s newsletters, september 2002 on treating cholesterol, and January 2003 on lowering triglycerides to give you some ideas in working with you and your husband’s physician. Sometimes patients have to do an experiment such as cutting out the avocado’s, nuts and fruits with a repeat panel in 2-3 weeks. Exercise helps stabilize the arterial system along with other many positive aspects. You can peruse the video’s on nutritonfacts.org for those of interest and keep tuned in as the science keeps coming. Congrats on you and your husband’s progress so far.Esther, Go to Dr. Esselstyn’s site and contact him via email. Inform him about your husband’s predicament. Leave your phone #. He often returns calls and provides his insight.Can you help me with an e-Mail address. I coul not find it in his site. Thanks a lot.In lieu of contacting Dr Esselstyn, you can post a question on Dr McDougall’s forum. https://www.drmcdougall.com/forums/Thanks again. Very nice communityI think this is an excellent article. It gets to the problem so many people are curious about when going to a plant-based diet. Why doesn’t my doctor recommend a plant-based diet when my cholesterol is high? I will have to stop eating all the junk foods that I like so much! How will I be satisfied when I can’t eat these foods any longer? These are the reasons so many people don’t move to a plant-based diet. I personally have found that I feel better eating a whole foods plant based diet. There is no question. My LDL cholesterol has gone from around 200 to just over 160. I feel better. I don’t have cravings for junk food. Though I still have some ‘food coma’ after lunch, I feel my energy level does not have the same high and low swings that it used to have. I also used to deal with chronic fatigue and dysthemia, both of which have vastly improved since I’ve gone on this healthier diet. People sometimes make fun of the food I eat, sometimes calling it bird food (and I can laugh about it too). The fact is, I feel better now; I have no reason to go back to how I used to eat (SAD- standard american diet). In my humble opinion, not eating a plant-based diet is foolish. The other thing is that it’s not hard to make vegetarian food taste good. In fact I don’t really like tofu–my body finds it difficult to digest– so I don’t eat that much of it. There are plenty of other things to choose from and ways to season them. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, leafy greens–these all taste good naturally and with very little seasoning required. It may take some time for your taste to adjust to the new diet. But you won’t look back once you’ve made the decision to go plant based. It’s a win-win in so many ways.“Why then, don’t more doctors advise their patients to change their diets?”Because $$$$$$$$$$$$$$….. money. If people are sick, they go to doctors, then doctors give them drugs and similarly say, “If you feel ill again, please come back and I will give you more “medicine”.”“medicine” is bad drug. More sick people = more drugs = more $$$$$$$$$$$$ to docs. Evil cycle of money.you have the cycle half correct.More sick people = more drugs = $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ to Pharmaceutical companies.Doc’s only get about $60-80 for a 20 minute office visit and with that money they have to pay about a 50-60% overhead. These monies that they get are controlled by the insurance companies and every year they trend downward. Why? Because Insurance companies are for profit and have share holders that want to make a profit. So for insurance companies to make increasing amounts of money every year they have to increase insurance rates and decrease reimbursements which they do by paying less to providers and approving less procedures.I suggest you come over to Australia:The benefits:You won’t have to deal with HMOs or insurance companies.You won’t get sued unless you are mind numbingly incompetent. You will probably earn FAR more ($150-200/hr net).The downsides: You’ll see far more patients (40-60 day) No nurses or physicians assistants to help out Longer working hours (50-60 hours) and fewer holidays (due to a severe doctor shortage).The neutrals: No white coat The patients will use your first nameAll 3 (Doctors, Insurance Companies & Pharma) profit from sick people exploitation (not just the pharma). The whole health care system is based on exploitation of patients. I twice was almost conned into doing unneeded surgery (once for my back ache and a second time inside my eye – for a harmless “Birth Mark”. And don’t forget the hospitals. They charged my insurance company and sued me for more than 15K for a heat stroke I had in the park (in 100F I fainted). All they had to do was cool me down. Instead they did BRAIN SCAN & other Einsteinian unrelated crap. The vast majority are after your MONEY and it’s FRAUD.Would you think that another barrier is sometimes the physician’s or nutritionist’s own psychological denial or unwillingness to adopt a WFPB diet? Might it sometimes be that the professional is projecting his or her own unwillingness to change or “to give up” favorite foods onto the patient?Absolutely!I have 60 years and I need to try to have a reasonable life.My question is about supplements that I take, everyday:– Astaxanthin 5mg,– Pine Bark Extract (Pycnogenol) 100mg– Gingko Biloba – standardized extract (24mg Gingkoflavona glycosides and terpenes lactones 6mg), and– Coenzyme Q10 100mg.Is correct consuming these supplements? Or am I just spoiling the money and health?I also use other substances which are foods, not supplements, like Tumeric Curcumin, currently in capsule, 50mg (95% curcuminoids), but I will go to consume it in biological powder.I am thinking consume Peruvian Maca powder, bio, because, also, I suffer from erectile dysfunction after I get widowed, in August 2013.I appreciate with all my heart your possible help.I have published your work on social networks and will continue to do so, with all my enthusiasm.My thanks for the good you do to all people who have a little common sense in his head.Thank you so much.its so true, we are eating a plant based diet and we feel great and my husband heart disease is no longer a problem. Blood test show he is doing great. We feel so healthySo the question that comes to mind is if one can only partially shift to a plant based diet is it worth doing at all?I’m a 66-year-old vegan female. I walk two miles a day and keep my weight under control. Yet, I can’t seem to get my LDL below 130-150. My ratio is always good, and my HDL is good. My husband’s cholesterol was normal when he died of a major heart attack. I’m starting to wonder how important cholesterol levels really are.How long would you have to be on a vegan diet to get rid of all the plaque in the veins?I think it has been demonstrated that changes can be seen within the first 3 weeks, although I do not remember the citation. Remember to go as low fat as possible, no oils, and only whole plant foods. That is keyI already notice a big difference since for examply my eyesight improved quite a bit in the last half year and the etternal backpain went away. Also my cold fingers are gone and I have much more air while sporting. And something else is just as functional as it used to be.I’m doing mostly that. Except for the eating spoon of pumpkin seed oil I enjoy with a volumous salad, the local speciality of Austria.The pilot trial evidence is that plaque reductions are visible during angiography after 1 year (in the 1990 Ornish study) or 32-60 months (in Esselstyn’s first study) of a very low fat plant based diet.More importantly, case reports from these and other lifestyle doctors report that symptoms of angina (chest pain, esp. during moderate exercise) are dramatically reduced within weeks. I’ve also read similar early signs of improved blood flow in erectile dysfunction, a sentinel of systemic vascular disease. This seems due to better endothelial function (vessel dilation to flow), and reduced inflammation.In reduction of coronary risk, reduced endothelial inflammation is all important. Most heart attacks occur not because a plaque progressively occludes the artery, but because the fibrous cap over a plaque ruptures, flopping into the stream or sending clots downstream. Perhaps by largely eliminating the postprandial floods of inflammatory compounds (long chain saturated fats, endotoxins, etc), these fibrous caps are offered a respite to heal and strengthen. Its this that may offer coronary protection within weeks, while actual plaque reduction may take longer.I highly recommend this energetic presentation by Dr. Esselstyn. It strongly influenced my decision to go low-fat plant based.My Phosphrous is high what can I take to lower it.Doctors are lobbied hard by the pharmaceutical industry. Why isn’t it that the WFBP community hasn’t at least produced a brochure that could be delivered to all MDs in their community? I think this would be an excellent, life-saving strategy. Inexpensive. Maybe something that PCRM, VegFund or NutritionFacts could do (or combine efforts on).Thank you!!Wide differences in response to WFPB dietBoth my wife and I started eating a whole foods, plan based diet on May 1st. In my case, the results were very much as I expected. My total cholesterol dropped from 246 to 169 and my LDL dropped from 176 to 106.My wife, who ate what I ate, saw very different results. Her total cholesterol increased from 233 to 289 and her LDL increased from 148 to 198. She has historically had problems with high cholesterol and was taking a statin for several years until the muscle problems became an issue. Prior to our starting to eat a WFPB diet, she had been taking 1 gram of niacin twice a day. When we started on May 1st she reduced the niacin to 500 milligrams twice a day, so maybe that decrease in niacin resulted in her increase in LDL.However, that still leaves the real question – what can she do to get her cholesterol numbers under control if 6 months eating a WFPB diet did not do it?Thanks in advance for any suggestions.Steve: Congratulations on both of you for making this effort.I’m not a doctor, but I would suggest that you search this site for specific foods that have been shown to lower cholesterol. I would think that you are both on the right path, but your wife’s diet (and couldn’t hurt for you too) may need some tweaking to focus on certain foods for her particular problem. Just an idea.Something also to think about: I’m not always sure when I see “WFPB” written that someone else understands that term the same way I do. Are you careful to stay away from oils? All oils? And what about other high, fat processed foods such as chocolate? (a personal weakness of mine) For most people, it may not matter to have some of these things in their diet. But maybe for your wife’s situation, it would be worth being particularly strict for a while.Good luck to both of you!Thea, thanks for your suggestions. As far as our diet goes, I would say we are 95-98% compliant with our understanding of a WFPB diet (no animal products, no added fat, no processed food). In her case, maybe strict compliance is necessary, but at this level (95-98%) there is no sense of “dieting” in the negative sense. I was just shocked to see her lipid numbers actually go UP when we are eating this way.Steve: re: being surprised. I would be to. That’s very perplexing. And it sure sounds like you are doing pretty good diet-wise. Hopefully focusing on some of the foods listed on this site that have been shown to lower cholesterol would help. I sure hope so.Spoiler, question coming… lately I have been reviewing Paleo (and its many perturbations) versus Vegan (Whole Food Plant Based) diets. I recently watched the John Durant versus John Mackey debate (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ery6ez2M7aw) which made me find several answers to why I “Just say NO to Paleo”. But, one item has come up that has stumped me. Low cholesterol seems to correlate with depression, suicide and all sorts of mess. A simple google search and tons of scholarly articles seem to address the topic recently. Common sense says, if this were true, then all the populations Campbell studied would have been like lemmings running off a cliff before they ever had heart disease – but then they lived in blue zones so that doesn’t seem to happen. Any meta studies, any hints of truth here? My cholesterol is down from 233 to 162 after 1 year animal free and I am “Happy as a Lark”… should I start eating Lark eggs to stay that way :Prscoggin: I would go with common sense. I don’t personally know anyone who eats a whole plant food based diet and who later developed depression. (Not that I personally know all *that* many people…) It seems like a pretty far fetched idea to me–especially when you take into account this information from NutritionFacts: http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=moodAnd here is a copy and paste from Healthy Longetivity, a wonderful science-based blogger: “In regards to depressive symptoms, a recent review of clinical trials found that cholesterol lowering statins are associated with improvements in mood scores. Furthermore, several clinical trials have found that vegetarian diets, also known to lower serum cholesterol have favorable effects on measures of mood and stress. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3568015/ http://www.nutritionj.com/content/11/1/9 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=8205407 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3783150 ”I say, don’t worry, be happy! (And good on you for your last year’s worth of work! Awesome.)Thanks, Thea. I agree, common sense should prevail. That said, I cannot find studies on these cultures that Campbell uses to prescribe a magic number of “no higher than 150 mg/dl ttl cholesterol” to prevent heart disease. Also, sites like Mayo Clinic and articles like the one from Psychiatric Times warns about low cholesterol not just from statin use but also diet. The PT article warns about ttl cholesterol below 160 mg/dl. This kind of well-recognized brand name advise is not only giving fuel to the Paleos and others and I expect this topic to get more and more abuse and turn folks away from lowering their cholesterol even below near-200s.http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/expert-answers/cholesterol-level/faq-20057952http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/depression/cholesterol-and-mood-what%E2%80%99s-linkGoing to keep looking for meta-studies of populations but I an avionics engineer and not a doctor, so a bit challenged in the medical research dept. :)Dr. Greger: Because of a genetic defect my Lp(a) is 96.1 mg/dL. 30 mg/dL puts me at high risk for heart disease and I am three times over that. My LDL is 87, HDL is 40, Triglycerides are 108, and Total Cholesterol is 149. I cannot find any research or articles on how to lower my Lp(a) through either nutrition or drugs. Do you have any recommendations? Thanks, Jeff RulifsonIm on a no cholesterol, ow fat diet, which leaves a very plant based diet. My concern is my carbs are high, 60+% of my calorie intake. But its all fruit, veggies, whole grains. How do you balance a plant based diet without carbs being an issue?High intake of carbohydrates don’t seem to be a problem. If you’d like to cut back on them cut back maybe this low-carb plant-based diet can help? I do not necessarily recommend it because I have seen excellent clinical results from a strict plant based diet: A multicenter randomized controlled trial of a plant-based nutrition program to reduce body weight and cardiovascular risk in the corporate setting: the GEICO study.Good luck whatever you choose! Let me know if you want more information. Dr. Greger explains in his book, “Carbophobia”, the importance and healthfulness of carbohydrates (unrefined whole grains). I am sure others can attest to carbohydrates not being an issue, however, do what works for you!Best regards, Josephconfused: Why are you concerned about the 60%+ carbs when they are all from fruit, veggies, and whole grains? (no beans? Oh my! ;-) ) Your diet sounds so healthy to me. If only everyone ate as well as you… If only *I* ate as well as you!!I mean that as a sincere question. It only makes sense to be concerned about a carb percentage if we have some good evidence on the topic saying it is a problem. To give you something to compare against: traditional Okinawans are some of the longest lived, healthiest people on the planet. Here is their macro-nutrient breakdown by percent of calories: >>> carbs: 85 (mostly from sweet potatoes) >>> protein: 9 >>> fat: 6 from Table 1 of: The Diet of the World’s Longest-Lived People and Its Potential Impact on Morbidity and Life Span. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1114: 434–455 (2007) (Thank you Rami for this info several years ago. It is priceless.)By that measure, your carbs are on the low side. *NOT* that I’m saying your carbs are really too low. I’m just giving you something to compare against.Does that help with your concern?","['alternative medicine', 'athletes', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cardiovascular health', 'cholesterol', 'complementary medicine', 'depression', 'fiber', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'fruit', 'heart disease', 'heart health', 'LDL cholesterol', 'Lifestyle medicine', 'mood', 'nuts', 'plant-based diets', 'statins', 'vegans', 'vegetarians']","According to the Director of the famous Framingham Heart Study, the best way to manage cholesterol and heart disease risk is with a more plant-based diet.

And parents think they are promoting health when they feed their children dairy. Thanks for bringing the facts to light and helping people see the truth behind the dairy lobbying lies.Those lies have cost many people dearly.I have a Japanese friend who told me she was essentially force fed milk during her childhood, despite the fact that she is lactose intolerant. She had diarrhea at least 50% of her childhood, but brainwashed adults thought they were doing her a favor. That was 25 years ago, things have probably changed in Japan.Id bet the “cows milk” discussed is the super processed, dead, homogenized, pasteurized BS from malnourished cows. Real milk from HEALTHY cows is still alive with Lactobacilli (and other beneficial microorganisms that are there to inoculate a baby mammals intestines), enzymes, minerals and fat soluble vitamins, among many other unstable molecules.RAW milk from HEALTHY cows would not cause constipation in young children. Id bet it would greatly enhance digestion.Johnny have you seen any research substantiating your claim? It just seems so counter intuitive that human babies should drink cows milk.To me, it seems less intuitive that human babies eat vegetables than drink cows milk. After all, humans and vegetables are from a completely different kingdom, while cows and humans are more closely related. -Im all for veggies, but the above illustrates my point nicely. I dont see how being a different species is relevent.Intuition aside, i have no scientific literature to back up the above (id bet its out there), however there have been millenia (literally) of years that humans have drank milk (why would they go through the trouble to boil it?) and recognized the life giving power of it. To me, thats likely more than scientific literature could ever prove.Milk never worked well for my family. So now we never buy it. First my daughter turned up lactose intolerant and then my son developed terrible acne that went away as soon as I was able to convince him to try to give it up for just 2 weeks. Oh and by-the-way that was raw milk from the farmers market. Had I known better at the time I never would have introduced cows milk/dairy of any kind.Johnny, Admittedly I’ve never tried raw cow’s milk but I want to offer up for your consideration this excerpt from a recent video of Dr. Greger’s, “Saving Lives by Treating Acne with Diet” that struck me as crucial when I first listened to it because it hones in on a key biochemical implication of cow’s milk consumption by humans and why the target species is relevant:“Milk is not just food but appears to represent a most sophisticated hormone signaling system activating TOR, which is of critical concern given that TOR recognized as the fundamental driving force for a number of diseases. But if milk is naturally supposed to stimulate TOR, why the problem? Because we’re drinking milk from the wrong species. Cow’s milk is designed for calves. Cow infants grow nearly 40-times faster than human infants. Cow’s milk has three times more leucine, the primary activator of TOR, so it may lead to human TOR over-stimulation. It’s like where they do experiments giving donkey milk to rats to see what happens. Makes no sense. And of course milk is for babies, continued consumption of any kind of milk during adolescence and adulthood is something that never really happened naturally, and may have long-term adverse effects on human health.”Here’s a link to the video from which the above excerpt is copied: 2http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saving-lives-by-treating-acne-with-diet/If you have no good reason for making your claims, then why do you make them, with EMPHATIC CAPS included? It simply reads as your own bias talking, and we know that there is a certain religiousity about raw milk in some people. Some of your wording right here (“life giving power”) shows this bias, and your last sentence is veering toward the antiscientific. Surgeons over the millenia have not made it their general practice to wash their hands before operating until relatively recently, for example, but no biggie, right?There is no question that milk has had “life giving power” for some populations for millenia, but what kind of life giving power do you have in mind? Can’t a pastoral culture revere their staple food source simply because it enables them to survive? Were milk-drinking people over the millenia ever particularly concerned with the health of those over 50? Would the pathogenic risks of milk or the long term effects on their lipids stand out to them very much when so many other forms of infectious disease were a larger problem?Do you think that unpasteurized milk is necessarily a food without risks to health, just because it has been used as food for a long time, and with some degree of reverence? For a long time in many cultures, alcohol and tobacco have been treated with reverence, but these are obviously problematic things.And if you are aware that raw milk is generally implicated with a greater burden of foodborne illness in the here and now (as, for example, here: http://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/rawmilk/raw-milk-questions-and-answers.html) but are choosing to ignore that in order to push your citation-free certitude about the healthfulness of raw milk, I think that’s somewhat shameful.The issue is that they are so much like us that some times this is confusing to our system. Type 1 diabetes is an example of this where antibodies built up against cow protein is confused with the pancreas cells. There is also just confusion sometimes as the link with caseomorphins and muscular dystrophy showsI have read studies done on raw milk versus UHT/ homogenised—>. ” Adelle Davis “lets have healthy children” promoted various things for children’s health- raw milk being one of them..her writings about the studies of the effects of UHT milk and its effects were very interesting.Interesting assertion. However, dairy is less standard in most parts of the world because lactose intolerance is very close to the norm in many gene pools. The impact of milk protein is less obvious than that of milk sugar. But the studies have shown that milk protein has many deleterious effects including provoking auto immune problem which have impacted me directly.The studies noted here did not take into account anything but the milk and the milk protein. I do not doubt that the micro flora you mention could be helpful but it is just not necessary that any beneficial ones come from milk. At the same time we began pasteurization due to the many deaths from raw milk. Indeed that is still a concern.I did drink lots of milk growing up and much of it was raw. At 21 I developed type I diabetes. At 55 I developed psoriatic arthritis. I woke up (more like flipped out) when they wanted to put me on an immune system suppressant and began studying. Eliminating gluten helped almost immediately but after reading about all the dietary dairy and meat impacts I went whole food plant based diet. All the residual symptoms disappeared and the gluten sensitivity did as well.I’ve seen other reports that a WFPBD can often eliminate gluten sensitivity.Johnny, the evidence on dairy and animal products is growing every day and it’s not a pretty picture.Only in countries that pasteurize their milk. Most people can digesting lactose. It’s the pasteurized, homogenized protein that is a problem. That’s why the Mayo Clinic calls it milk protein intolerance.to Rawmilkmike With respect, is it possible that in spite of the Tsunami of evidence contrary to your opinion, the only reason you plod on and persevere is because you don’t want to change your screen name? :)That was then, and this is now. Scientists have proven that the cow is the only creature that has the IGF-1 (growth factor) that triggers so many diseases, like diabetes and cancer growth, ear infections, growth of flu, pneumonia, leukemia, etc. Genetically, the Bonobos primates are almost equal to us. They are the most peaceful creatures in existence. Goats, buffalo, yaks, sheep do not have the IGF-1. Please look up this information at notmilk.com and PCRM.org. (an organization of over 5,000 medical doctors, all of which do not include dairy from cows in their recipes in their Cancer Project and their president’s – Dr. Neal Barnard’s book “The Dr. Neal Barnard Program for Reversing Diabetes”, which we also use along with Dr. Gabriel Cousens’ book, “There is a Cure for Diabetes” in our classes, which are funded by a grant by the City of Homestead.).IGF-1 (growth factor) is necessary for life. rBGH, a genetically engineered artificial hormone injected into dairy cows to increase milk production, is not.No sane human being walks up to a cow and desires their milk.Your statement is subjective and rather rude.Really?? It’s subjective to say that humans look at a cows teet and their instinctual reaction isn’t to put their lips on it and start sucking away??? Really….. that’s subjective???? And how exactly is that statement rude?I think it’s rude to take the milk of breastfeeding animal that was biologically designed for their own offspring (just like any other mammal) and think it belongs to us just because we like dipping our oreos into something. I think that’s kind of rude.Because it is not necessary for optimal health to eat any kind of dairy product from any source, your comment is not rude – and certainly from the cow’s perspective, unnecessarily exploiting cows IS rude.Two of the most highly suspected causes of diabetes, excess protein and excess sugars, are far worse yet when combined. This is what the dairy industry and USDA absolutely do NOT want you to know (gotta love corporate influence). The most common AND consumed source of protein and sugars – milk. So, even raw milk from free range “happy” cows (!?) would be bad, for starters…When healthy cows cannot be exploited for milk any longer they are slaughtered – so much for “healthy” cows.I had to get up early and milk, by hand, with my father. Hated it. We’d sell most and one bucket went right into the kitchen. A towel strained out the big chunks as it went into brown gallon jugs. We would pull that ice cold raw milk out of the refrigerator and drink it down by the tumbler full. He loved it. So did I, especially on hot sunny days.One autumn, at fifty two, he went out to hunt deer. He didn’t come home. We found him dead next morning on a hillside. Heart attack. The autopsy showed his arteries were loaded up with pure, unadulterated unpasteurized plaque.They told mom and us boys to eat cheese, fish and chicken and EXERCISE MORE…on our farm!!!! They never said a thing about restricting dairy. So at 50, my turn came, heart attack, quad bypass. Anecdotes aside, the science is screaming at us: Raw milk from healthy cows will sicken and kill humans of all ages.Only two more questions; How long since that surgery and what is your endothelial health now given the changes you’ve made? I know from your many posts that you have made drastic changes in your lifestyle and I would be very interested in the results. With type I diabetes my arterial condition is supposed to be treated as though I’ve already had a heart attack. So of course my doctor is eager to prescribe statins. With this diet my total cholesterol is now 110 so I’ll pass. I do have a friend whose CAD history is not unlike yours ie active but a lousy diet and it almost killed him. He has chosen, after the first surgery, more stents and drugs for life. He now is starting to suffer dementia and falls (at age 70). My guess is yours is a much better outcome.Best wishes to you and anyone coping with Type I. They seem to have come so far with humulin and pumps. I hope life is getting closer to “normal” for you. I am sure you can have healthy arteries and trade off some or all of the statin for plant-based eating. But do keep that great cholesterol number. Even, IMO, if it takes a small hit of statin.My op was on St Pat’s day, 2004. They didn’t/couldn’t get it all so I still had angina after. Could not walk to the mailbox without a break. Started whole plant foods on 11 July 2011. Now, 50 lbs lighter, have no detectable angina. I was on 90 mg of simvastatin with cholesterol above 5 mMolar(200 usa)…now it is 4 mMolar on zero statin.My brother is going the stent/drug route. Locked into a hunter SAD lifestyle, A typical veg for him is slaw drenched in sugar/mayo. Belief in “clean, wild game”, low-fat dairy, free range eggs as natural. I see his mind disintegrating. TIA’s, memory loss, brittle frustrated rage. Simple maths are a struggle. The difference between the two of us could not be greater.I tell my story, bang this drum loudly over and over because I can’t bear to see family and strangers alike going down needlessly. I feel like Logan might have if he’d made a successful run.You know what’s even better for young children? PEOPLE milk! It totally enhances digestion. Of course, no one really needs even people milk after a year or two… then it’s okay to drink water. Or the juice of soybeans. Or almonds. Or other plants, if you really must have a protein drink. ;)Raw healthy cow milk is what I was raised on and yes it does cause constipation, as I know all too well. When finally at age 11 ,, was “allowed” to choose what I ate__ mostly vegetables,,, stopped drinking milk , rarely ate cheese, oh to my delights every thing came out easy everyday. Also skin problems I had went away within 2 weeks.My entire life was riddled with constipation, gas, and anal fissures until I discovered Dr. Greger’s website and gave up meat and dairy products. I wish it didn’t take me 31 years to figure this out! The “doctor” I saw suggested surgery with the possible side effect of incontinence. No thanks! I’ll just eat some greens and beans! Can’t thank you enough Dr. Greger!Music to my ears!Quitting wheat and gluten and doing low FODMAPS seems to help me with constipation (and of course, abstaining from dairy).I would like to add to this discussion the fact that some kids (and adult kids, including me) have both allergy to milk protein AND lactase deficiency (problems with milk sugar) which manifests by diarrhea symptoms or alternating diarrhea and constipation (as well as further distractions caused by ear-nose-throat symptoms). As was explained to me in my early 20’s by one of the last true scientist-GI Specialists in America, these two metabolic errors often come together and the confusing symptoms mislead to incorrect, superficial diagnoses as simply a milk protein problem. Eliminating milk also gives the bonus of eliminating the many additional symptoms – GI + ear-nose-throat.I too would bet it was a study using pasteurised milk ? I am from the UK and personally have witnessed healing with myself and my pets with the use of raw milk from Jersey cows.is the Jersey cow milk that tesco sells is raw? without artificial hormones injected into cow to produce milk?Hi, Ravi no unfortunately no UK store stocks raw milk, Jersey yes but not raw. I get mine from a farm local to me in the North West there is a web site that lists them in the UK. I hope no one objects to me posting this but it is naturalfoodfinder.co.uk.Astounding! I had to have a sphincterotomy a couple decades ago to deal with a fissure problem when I was younger. I has some recurring issue but thankfully nothing as serious… Anyway. Now, I know what was behind this, besides the likely too low level of fiber that I was consuming. It was the milk products! Ah! It is very sick that the American way of life has produced a situation where the medical system can now count on close to the entire population being sick and dependent on medical care and drugs for the last 15-20 years of each person’s life. The bad dietary habits aren’t simply deadly but they provide a long, extremely drawn out death ideally suited so the system can maximize it’s profits off each and every person. Not me. That’s one system I don’t want to get hooked into. And if this is the model for this one sector of our economy, don’t you imagine others are probably infected by the same anti-human, or inhuman, type of caring model for the public? It’s certainly true with the financial services industry. They have so many people as debt slaves now that only a fool couldn’t see it. Health slaves. Debt slaves. Education debt slaves. These are not the attributes of a nation that values freedom. Freedom would mean that we have an overwhelming preference for independence and for not relying on these parasitic features of our society.You are so correct – slaves. See my reply to “Outer Banks Co-op”.I’d like to know to what extent any of this research can be (from a scientific perspective) applied to the general population, rather than just children with chronic idiopathic constipation.This is just another nail to the milk coffin. Milk probably increase the risk for cardiocascular disease, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune disease etc.My daughter suffers from this and has her whole life. She has been off cows milk for 2 yrs and off everything dairy for about a year. She refuses to drink water and only wants juice which causes other problems too. Any suggestions on alternative ways to hydrate her? She has dealt with two bladder infections within a year due hydration issues. She will drink oat milk but uses that to fill her stomach instead of food (another major issue). She won’t eat anything unless it has cheese in it and we cannot find the best non-dairy cheese or substitute that will suffice. Any suggestions on this matter would be greatly appreciated!Eat juicy, water-dense fruit.Make a smoothie of berries and dates with a some water.Dr. G has a recipe for hibiscus, erythritol sweetened beverage…“My family’s recipe is to soak a handful of bulk dried organic hibiscus flowers overnight and then blend with a knuckle of fresh ginger, a teaspoon of amla, three tablespoons of erythritol, and a handful of fresh mint leaves to make the half-gallon we drink throughout the day. By blending in the mint, you’re adding dark green leafies to what may be the highest antioxidant beverage in the world, and it tastes like fruit punch! Your kids will love it. ”Link to a blog post : http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/03/hibiscus-tea-the-best-beverage/And seriously hibisbus is tasty. It really looks and tastes like fruit punch. Might be good for your juice obsessed child, haha.He also has some nice videos about getting children to eat veggies. Link below-http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-home/Sounds like a great idea. I’ll make some of that too!Amy, give her some lemonade made with fresh lemon juice, a little fresh mint, and lightly sweetened with organic cane sugar or erythritol. Since it’s mostly water, it will hydrate her, as well, the lemon in it will be healthy and cleansing.Find ways to get more fiber in her diet to help improve her bowels. Oatmeal with a little ground flax might help, some sliced apples, bananas, oranges, and strawberries (make a fruit salad).Also, homemade watermelon pops are a great treat and provide good hydration. Just take some seedless pureed watermelon, a bit of lemon juice, sweeten as desired.Hope that helps, and good luck!Also, I’ve found that Daiya brand vegan cheese is the best tasting so far.“My daughter suffers from this…” Not sure what “this” is but, whatever, it appears her refusals and insistance(s) could hardly be got around with food. I would say she would benefit form counselling so that she can make choices rather than be dictated to by her obsession with refusing this and insisting on that. :)It is not the dairy products, it is what has been done to the dairy by the dairy industry. Not even baby calves can thrive on homogenized, high pasturized , hormone filled milk. Homogenizing makes it the most dangerous. Its not even the same molecule anymore. Some people can drink dairy that IS NOT homogenized but is lightly pasturized AND from grass-fed cows ; others can only drink certified raw which is almost always from grassfed cows. I am from a state where raw milk was inspected and certified and there was never a problem with it in the entire 50 years i drank it as it was delivered in glass bottles to my families’ door. However, as an adult, i have sinus problems every time I drink milk from the store. Yogurt with live cultures doesn’t seem to be much of a problem to many people that I deal with, but cheese and butter have been ruined as well and give many people problems. It’s not the REAL FOOD that is a problem, its the FAKE MILK created for profit that is killing us and our kids. I personally breastfed my children for 2 years each and neither have any allergies to anything. I also gave them no solid food before 7 months to protect their delicate digestive system from allergens. I wish I had been so lucky! I was dairy-formula fed as are most people these days. If we would just leave well-enough alone, all this UNNATURAL FOOD wouldn’t be making us so sick. Just an old woman’s 2 cents worth…….It is not required for optimal health to take any source or kind of milk product, therefore it is UNNECESSARY EXPLOITATION of the innocent to take any kind of milk product from any source. It’s still slave milk.I am vegan, I don’t share Madhava’s sentiment that animal agriculture is necessarily exploitation.But the current system seems to represent torture of animals….It would seem obvious to me that steroid, chemical free milk is better than steroid heavy milk.It is also likely that no milk > milk.All milk is steroid heavy. Breastmilk from any species, added synthetic hormones or not, is filled with hormones. This is perfectly healthy and natural [for an infant of the same species].Big Beefy etc your life may be vegan in some or many ways but part of being vegan is to express exaclty what Madhava said.Just to clarify – we all need at least one form of animal milk. Our mother’s. Once we are weaned we never need to consume animal milk or by-products again. Breast is best followed by a whole plant food diet.Calves will die within 6 months if given pasteurized, homogenized milk. Not many people have really thought about what happens emotionally to the cow and calf when separated. The cow’s grief (as does all emotions, ours included) goes into the fat, and when we eat that fat, the emotions go into us, and we wonder why we are feeling ‘down’ and ‘depressed’, when the normal feelings we should be feeling are joy and bliss. When one talks to people who are living a truly vegan life, especially the higher vibration life of living foods, one notices an exuberance and natural excitement that are absent in other groups and this silent peace is free to all who understand that we are one, and when animals are grieving and are feeling rage, this goes into the eater and drinker of the animal’s by-products. I call this the creature’s revenge My Asian and Eastern friends understand this. As long as we exploit others, whether animals or groups of people, we will pay a steep price in our own physical and emotional/psychological health.Dr Flora Claims like this will be dismissed by the majority. You could counter that by quoting your scientific sources.to Outer Banks Co-op Respectfully, what you appear to have thoroughly missed is that although health can improve with raw milk, compared to treated milk, most of what is caused by milk is caused by both kinds. Read more widely and you will see that the problems with milk are because it is not meant for human consumption and whole populations who don’t drink it ( including cheese etc) do not have the problems it causes. Many people somehow fear giving up dairy products. Out addiction to it goes in less than 30 days and there are many benefits to be had. Just give it a try. You can always go back :)There is no question about it with all the research and knowledge we have now cows milk is for baby cows and not for human babies or adults. It is disgusting and nowerdays full of pus hormones bacteria and antibiotics. I never liked milk and when i had to drink it as a child because my parents still thought it was healthy than i constantly had throat inflamations. That disappeared when a homeopathic doctor told me to stop consuming milk and eggs. Now i stopped with dairy completely and am vegan i never felt better!I haven’t been drinking glasses of milk for a long time (2 or 3 years) but recently I have really tried to cut down on dairy byproducts, such as milk chocolate and even non dairy creamers which have milk byproducts in them. I now use a coconut creamer and I never buy cheese and try very hard to avoid it at restaurants and the like. I do it first and foremost for the ethical reasons, but the rationale that dairy has hormones that are meant to stimulate the growth of calves which are designed to grow much faster than humans. sounds very plausible as a reason as well to avoid dairy. Even “grass fed, organic” dairy would contain these hormones. I get my calcium from soymilk, blackstrap molasses, turnip greens and almonds and sometimes oranges as well. Now that I eat all of these things, when I fall I don’t break bones like I used to when I fell. Beans also have calcium in them. There is just too much cruelty in dairy farming for me to consume any dairy products.Suits this help with encopresis in children?I had chronic constipation when I was very young. My doctors attributed it to anxiety, which may have been true. What’s odd is that my doctors told my parents to give me laxatives and whole milk, while the rest of my family drank 1% milk. I wonder why this was so?Cow’s milk is intended for the calves, not us. Cows are kept constantly impregnated so they will keep producing milk. If a male calf is born, it is ripped away from its mother and sent to slaughter. Just so humans can have that milk instead. Hopefully your family no longer buys into cruelty.You have missed the point of my question, which is: Why would someone suggest whole cow’s milk as a means to treat constipation?As a mutant capable of digesting lactose, it’s a survival advantage for me to be able derive calories from products – but I doubt it’s optimal for my longevity. So I’m going to see what 3 months of a strict vegan diet does to my blood work, athleticism, and subjective well-being. Animal welfare is a nice bonus, but I am more concerned with improving my health and reducing my carbon footprint. I’m concerned that many people take up veganism for the sake of animal rights, rather than personal health. Without being educated about proper nutrition, many vegans suffer nutritional deficiencies after a while.I predict that a vegan diet devoid of refined flour, sugar, or vegetable oil, and with supplemental B12 and algae-derived omega-3 will make me healthier in 3 months. Time to put my prediction to the test!Good luck BenzoSt! You are on an exciting journey.With most doctors considering cow’s milk vital for children, maybe they didn’t consider *no milk* to be an option, so thought that the increased fat in whole vs 2% would somehow help with the constipation? I’m not saying it’s a good idea, just that maybe that’s what they were thinking.Probably so, but then again it might be hard to get kids to eat enough leafy greens to meet their calcium quota.Anyway, after being 99.9% vegan for about a month (I take supplements with gelatin capsules), I am more regular than ever. I’m consuming about 100g of fiber a day without even trying and pooping about 3 times a day, which is rather hedonistic.Previously to this vegan experiment I was experiencing intermittent constipation on an omnivorous diet that included sardines/salmon 2-3 times a week, meat like 1 time per month, egg whites fairly frequently, and yogurt and whey 2-3 times a day. Given what I have learned here, I think the dairy was the primary culprit for my prior irregular irregularity.BenzoSt: That second paragraph – almost had me laughing out loud.What I also really like about your post is the detail you went into about your previous diet. I think most people (Americans anyway) would read that and think that you had been eating animal products in moderation – maybe even not that much compared to other people. And yet when you went vegan (I think you are close enough to proudly claim the title), you experienced a significant, visible health improvement. Thanks for sharing! And for being funny. :-)Re: calcium, it really shouldn’t be an issue when promoting milk, since most milk only has calcium because the cows receive supplementation in their grain-based feed. Unless doctors are recommending only 100% grass-fed dairy to parents, there is no difference between giving a child milk vs giving the child a calcium supplement directly. While of course as we now know, grass-fed or not, there are multiple reasons to actively discourage milk consumption.This really sucks I love cheeseMost people can digesting lactose. It’s the pasteurized, homogenized protein that is a problem. That’s why the Mayo Clinic calls it milk protein intolerance.What can we give our kids. We have to grandsons ages 10 and14. They are allergic to soy, don’t like coconut milk and the 10 year old is allergic to almonds. Any suggestions?Sandy: Have you tried rice, hemp or oat milks? I have seen them all in the stores. You can also have fun making your own milks with various nuts, seeds and grains.They didn’t like hemp. They have not tried rice or oat milk. We want them to get their calcium.My older kids like the rice milk the best. We have tried them all.Thank you, we will give rice milk a try.Sandy K: Most of the commercial non-dairy milks have calcium added. You just have to check the box. When they do add the calcium, it usually equals or exceeds the amount in dairy milks.If the comment about wanting them to get calcium was in response to making your own milks, I can understand that. But you might want to educate yourself a bit about what foods have calcium in them. A proper whole food plant based diet will have lots of sources of calcium and may not need supplemented milks at all. Brenda Davis has a book that is a really good reference for proper diet and nutrient and includes a whole chapter on feeding children – including meal plans for children of various ages. The book is called: Becoming Vegan Express Edition. Just a thought.Good luck! It is so vital to feed kids right. I hope it works out for you.Thanks, Thea.Hi Sandy, I really enjoy rice milk, I think it’s the most “neutral” tasting milk, it reminded me the most of dairy milk in that regard. But I don’t buy it because at least where I live it’s quite a bit more expensive than soy or almond. However, it’s dirt cheap if you make it yourself – about $0.30 to $0.60 per gallon depending on how thick/dilute you like it.Also regarding calcium, I would second Thea’s advice, and perhaps recommend entering your children’s food into cronometer, so you can really see how much calcium they’re getting from a plant-based diet; you might discover they’re getting plenty without any milk.But also keep in mind that both non-dairy and most dairy milks simply contain calcium supplements; it’s not inherently present in significant amounts in non-dairy milks or in most cow’s milk, since most cows aren’t eating the leafy greens (grass) that the calcium originates from. The calcium in most cow’s milk comes from a supplement added to their feed. So unless the kids really enjoy drinking milk, or it’s a matter of habit or convenience, there’s no reason to think it would be a superior way to get calcium into your kids compared to just giving them a supplement.Sandy get their calcium from fruit and veges – search and you will see :]Why don’t try oat milk? You should be encouraging your children to live in a cruelty free world. What the Dairy industry does to the unwanted male calves, just so humans can have that milk instead, should be reason alone for your kids not to want to drink it. They are just used to the taste of dairy. Eventually they will get used to the taste of dairy free alternatives. Kids need to learn to accept that we cannot be part of animal cruelty just to suit our taste buds.They dont even need vegan milks to be healthy…Sandy please take a look at top vegetables for calcium http://happyforks.com/browse?q=&d=301-1&k=11 & top fruit for calcium http://happyforks.com/browse?q=&d=301-1&k=9 top legumes for calcium http://happyforks.com/browse?q=&d=301-1&k=16 top grains for calcium http://happyforks.com/browse?q=&d=301-1&k=20 & top nuts & seeds for calcium http://happyforks.com/browse?q=&d=301-1&k=12 and even some herbs has so much of calcium that few percent of daily RDA value you can get during the day from mixed spices like basil&poppy seeds&thyme&dill weed http://happyforks.com/browse?q=&d=301-1&k=2I hope this is helpful to check how much calcium your grandsons consume during typical day and maybe add some low dose supplement if it is really needed. I sometimes take 200mg cheap calcium supplement once or twice a day just to add some calcium to my diet and I never take those calcium supplemetns that contain whole daily RDA value for calcium cause I don’t need that much. Maybe consider doing the same if your grandsons don’t want to drink any kind of calcium fortified milk alternatives. You can also make some meal or even dessert and just add some low dose calcium supplement to it – and you get homemade calcium fortified meals:) You can do the same with b12.Raw milk. It will eventually cure their allergies.rawmilkmike: Dairy of any kind, whether raw or otherwise, is not a healthy food. The following videos will give you a start in understanding why that is:http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=dairyGood luck.Forks over Knives gives no proof that raw animal products don’t produce even better health benefits than a raw plant based diet. Anyone who says “raw or otherwise” is expressing there opinion. The studies they quote are not on raw milk or any other raw animal product. There are millions of raw milk consumers that grew up on pasteurized milk. They know the difference. How healthy do you think a plant based diet would be if it came in a can?rawmilkmike: re: ” How healthy do you think a plant based diet would be if it came in a can?” Quite healthy relatively, thank you! My diet consists of quite a bit of food from “cans”/pre-processed. I eat a lot of canned beans. And I eat jarred and boxed tomatoes. And I eat lots of frozen veggies which have been pre-cooked and stored in plastic bags. Etc. And by all the overwhelming scientific information and personal information I have gathered, I’m far healthier and have far less disease risk compared to milk drinking people–milk of any kind. But most especially raw milk.re: “… no proof that raw animal products…” I believe that Toxins addressed this point with you on another post. I will also refer you to the following site, which includes a list of stories of poor kids who got ***terribly*** sick (including losing kidneys) from drinking raw milk:http://realrawmilkfacts.com/real-life-storiesSo sad. These are not isolated incidents. This is why we pasteurize milk. Not that milk of any form is healthy. To understand the health risks, I’ll provide the following quote from the above site:“Between 1998 and 2008, 85 outbreaks of human infection resulting from consumption of raw milk reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including a total of 1,614 reported illnesses, 187 hospitalizations and two deaths. Illnesses and deaths have also been linked to the consumption of fresh cheese made from raw (unpasteurized milk), especially the Mexican-style queso fresco cheeses. Since many millions of people drink pasteurized milk every day in the United States, and only about 1-3% of the population drinks raw milk, the number of illnesses reported show that the actual risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is tremendously higher than drinking pasteurized milk.Statistics from the CDC and state health departments comparing raw and pasteurized dairy products linked to reported foodborne disease outbreaks (1973-2006) show that raw milk and Mexican-style queso fresco soft cheeses (usually made from raw milk) caused almost 70% of the reported outbreaks even though only 1-3% of the population consumes raw dairy products. If raw and pasteurized milk were equally risky, it would be expected that there would be far more pasteurized outbreaks since the number of people drinking conventional milk is so much higher.”I don’t expect any of this to be convincing for you. You appear to be very vested in drinking raw milk. I just hope others do not get mislead, which is why I responded again this time. I hope that you are able to stay healthy and wish you luck.Thanks for sharing this important information.So Thea, you admit you are not completely healthy. The only empirical evidence that exists on raw milk suggests that raw milk may help you with your health problems. — “poor kids” can’t afford raw milk in this country. — Toxins has not addressed the issue of “raw animal products”. Their data is on cooked and processed animal products. There is no empirical data linking raw milk to illness. Association is not proof of cause. — You are referring to unsubstantiated isolated incidents. Yes these children got sick and suffered terminable complications but what were the causes of the diarrhea and the complications? — According to U.S. government studies raw milk may actually have a negative risk factor. —– 1. An estimated 17.3% of raw milk consumers in Minnesota may have acquired an illness caused by 1 of these enteric pathogens during the 10-year study period. (That’s 1.7% per year.) or (1 in 59) and (No deaths in the US from fluid raw milk consumption.) —– 2. About 48 million people (That’s 15% per year or 1 in 6 Americans) get sick and 3,000 die each year from foodborne diseases, according new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. —– If raw milk is the most dangerous food NOT on the market how is it possible that only 1 in 59 raw milk consumer get sick each year from foodborne diseases while 1 in 6 Americans(78.5% of whom drink pasteurized milk and only 3% of whom drink raw milk.) get sick each year from foodborne diseases? Raw milk may be preventing 1.3 million cases of foodborne disease and 90 deaths every year in the US. Or in other words: Apparently people who don’t drink raw milk are 9 times more likely to contract a so called foodborne illness than people that do. — I am “very vested” in my health and that of my wife and children.Pasteurization does not guarantee that all dangerous pathogens will be killed.Dr. FloraMason Van Orden: That’s true. The above quote from “realrawmilkfacts” shows not only that drinking raw milk is more dangerous than drinking pasturized, but that drinking any milk comes with risks. I don’t know how the pasturized milk risks compare to risks of “foodborne disease outbreaks” of plant foods, but I do see that as being just one more reason of so many why drinking any kind of milk is not wise.Actually, raw plant foods have some of the worst so called outbreaks of so called food-borne disease.Would you eat raw chicken? I think raw plant foods are over hyped in the media because it is so unusual for it to happen, and people do not expect their raw produce to hurt them. But if you ate raw chicken we can assume that at the least,90% of the time you would get sick.If you buy raw chicken you can assume that at the least 90%(actually 65.2%) of the time it will contain E. coli.“It is important to note that only a small proportion of patients who ingest E. coli O157:H7 actually get sick. Infection can range from asymptomatic carriage of the bacteria to abdominal discomfort, bloody diarrhea, or even the more serious HUS.”Nice quote, but without context it is not evidence. Please share the studies.Why? Do you disagree?Rice milk?Have you tried rice milk?Cow’s milk is intended for the calf, not us! No wonder so many people have trouble consuming it. The fact so many male calves are destroyed within days of being born, just so the selfish human race can have that milk, speaks volumes on how rotten the human race is. I gave up all dairy products five years ago for that reason alone! Yet many people are only giving it up because reports now suggest it causes osteoporosis, constipation, diabetes etc. Proves that humans still have no compassion for other living beings. Would you drink your own mother’s breast milk beyond infancy? Of course you wouldn’t, but you’d happily drink a cow’s milk if it didn’t cause you any problems. You’ve been brainwashed for years by the Dairy industry. With the large amount of dairy-free alternatives available in the supermarket (soy, rice, almond oat milk), there is no need for anyone to buy cow’s milk. Stop buying into cruelty. What the industry does to male calves is so shocking, do you really want to be part of that??? I am quite appalled by some of the comments here. “Me, me, me”. No respect for the animals.I found interesting this post about past populations where meat and diary/milk were staple products:http://healthylongevity.blogspot.it/2013/10/Cardiovascular-Disease-in-Ancient-Civilizations.htmland about cow’s milk there is this review:http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1610-0387.2009.07019.x/pdfOf course, there is even the elephant in the room, id est “The China Study”…Thanks Merio! I just read them all. I found the German dermatology review most interesting and useful. It is on its way to some young friends with just these sorts of problems. Why is it taking so long to unmask this problem?And how could we ever change something so huge and powerful as the dairy industry? I think one critical step is to get this at least presented in schools from primary right through university. Just let the work stand on its own. But who is in control of that? Certainly not me. My assistantship was funded on a dairy grant. I really can’t see how my Alma Mater could ever support anything like unbiased teaching and research in dairy.When i was young i used to drink a LOT of milk, simply ’cause TV said that was good and doctors said that too so… Unfortunately people forget that we are not cows and our babies had a complete different growth rate compared to baby calf… i quote from wikipedia:A commercial steer or bull calf is expected to put on about 32 to 36 kg (71 to 79 lb) per month. A nine-month-old steer or bull is therefore expected to weigh about 250 to 270 kg (550 to 600 lb).“human babies” and “calves” will get sick and eventually die if there milk is pasteurized and homogenized. The same goes for any food and any creature really.Question: are you a baby cow ? What happens to a calve after the weaning period ? Any creature and food ? Does every creature in this world drink milk, or homogenized food ? Are potatoes digestible without proper cooking ?Merio’s Questions and answers: “Are you a baby cow?” No, do baby cows eat their mothers? “What happens to a calve after the weaning period?” We eat them. “Any creature and food?” Yes. “Does every creature in this world drink milk,” Any mammal does. “or homogenized food?” No and that’s my point. “Are potatoes digestible without proper cooking?” Consuming raw potatoes has more health benefits than cooked one. Because of its high content of potassium, sulfur, phosphorus, and chlorine, undiluted raw potato juice is proven to be effective in clearing up skin blemishes. However, you can get this potato benefits only if you consume potato as raw food because these powerful minerals are converted to inorganic atoms when potatoes are cooked. And, the best way to consume it raw is by taking it as juice. Fresh raw undiluted potato-carrot juice is so nutritious. A cup or two of potato-carrot juice a day is a great help to health problems like skin blemishes and high blood pressure.So you are not a baby cow perfect, so why we need their milk ???For the second question you are righ in part, but i forget to add that i was talking about free baby cows that after their weaning period STOP to drink milk and start to eat grass just like other cows, they do not eat milk anymore…For the third i was talking about ALL the animal kingdom (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal) and of course you are wrong because only mammals feed their babies with milk during the lactation period (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation).For the fourth, your right: any mammal does (NOT every creature in the world)… until the weaning period where they stops to eat milk and start to look at other types of food.I’m sorry for the homogenized food question, i forget to erase that after writing the post.While for the potato question i am at odds with you and i think that it’s not a good way to eat potato raw.You can get vitamins by eating fruit and veggies, there is not need to eat potatoes raw.While for the minerals, talking in general: Calcium (I), Phosphorus (I), Iron (I), Sodium (I), Chloride (I) , Zinc (I) are absorbed in an inorganic form (I):http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/smallgut/absorb_minerals.htmlhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC297237/http://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/highlight_pathway?scale=1.0&map=map04978&keyword=magnesiumWhile Co is absorbed in an organic form (B12 vitamin), Fe could be absord in both form (organic (heme) and inorganic).Anyway if you feel confident to eat raw potatoes i can’t argue with that.While i agree with you that fresh juices could be really useful for everyday diet.Merio’s Questions and answers: I assume we are still talking about raw unprocessed milk bought direct from the farm. “so why do we need their milk ???” We don’t. What’s your point? Almost any food can be replaced if you try hard enough, especially if price, taste, availability, and proper supplementation are not an issue. You do realize that in some European countries effective vitamin supplements are already prohibited. If your friends at the FDA, CDC, WHO, and AMA get their way we could see the same prohibition here. If you don’t like milk fine but please don’t support the organizations trying to force feed us GMO corn, soy, wheat, and toxic drugs that do not cure the illnesses they cause. These people would love to eliminate the cows, chicken, and fish and just feed us the GMO corn and soy directly.Humans have no set “weaning period” or “lactation period”. Look it up. You will get all kinds of answers. What it comes down to is as long as the mother has the time and the inclination. What does this have to do with the nutritional value of milk?Maybe you do “not need to eat potatoes raw” but the point is you don’t need to eat them cooked either and they are healthier raw. “Fruit and veggies” can be cooked and pasteurized also. Where do you draw the line? The more you cook and process your food the more you rely on supplementation. How do you even know what supplements to take? Who can you trust for such information and how do you keep it all strait?My point is that we should minimize animal food as possible (1-2 time per week), so milk consumption (of course different from human milk that is perfectly fine for babies) should tend to zero; while maximizing intake of veggies, fruit, whole grains and legumes.I do not have any friend at the FDA, CDC, WHO and AMA, and probably my thougths about human health in general could be at odds with them; it depends on the subject.I do not support them any way cause i am not an US citizen.The GMO issue is really important for me, in fact i think that we should NOT use GMO food since we do not need it and for my perspective there are too many questions about it.You are in doubt with soy ? Change legume !!!If they want to eliminate animal food ?I do not think so or FDA will try every action to destroy animal business while it does not even address the antibiotics foodstock debate.And remember that the vast majority of soy feed goes to animals:http://www.wisoybean.org/news/soybean_facts.phpAnd “we”(=women) have a lactation period (the period when the mother produces milk for her babies) while the weaning period is when babies start to eat other foods different from milk.You you cannot decide to give hamburgers to a new born.For the “pasteurized” issue is really simple: there a lots of fruit and veggies that should be eaten raw, why i have to have problems with potatoes when i can eat carrots, apples, berries etc raw ? Mix cooked food and raw carrots, to be sure to eat enough vitamins.I eat potatoes for starch, not vitamins.For nutritional guideline read this article by Doctor Greger:http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/Or check this site created only for evaluating supplements:http://examine.com/Wasn’t the issue the length of the lactation period, not whether or not women have one? You can decide when to give hamburgers to a baby, 6 months, a year, or 6 years. It’s completely up to the mother.“A mother and her baby should breastfeed for as long as they wish to breastfeed. It provides continuing protection against diarrhea and respiratory tract infection. Breastfeeding should be continued for as long as mutually desired by mother and child. All the benefits of human milk including nutritional and health continue for as long as your baby receives your milk. In fact, as your baby takes less human milk, these advantages are condensed into what milk is produced. Many of the health benefits of human milk are dose related, that is, the longer the baby receives human milk, the greater are the benefits. To quote Dr. William Sears, “There is no set number of years you should nurse your baby.” If you and your child enjoy breastfeeding, there is no reason you need to stop. Both of you will continue to benefit from breastfeeding as long as you like.”The WHO is international and so are most of our problems with access to healthy food.Thanks to your comment on the potato look what we have stumbled across.http://nutrimaxorganic.com/health_topics/raw_potato_juice.htmlhttp://omtimes.com/2012/10/12-benefits-of-potato-juice-a-very-healthy-drink/http://healingtouchbw.blogspot.com/2010/02/power-of-raw-potato-juice.htmlhttp://guide2herbalremedies.com/therapeutic-properties-potato-juice/http://www.livestrong.com/article/279691-the-benefits-of-juicing-a-potato/I think there is a misunderstanding cause i think that mothers should breastfed their babies as long as they can; i do not think it’s a problem for human to eat human milk.The WHO said at least 6 month, but i think that one year is better even more if the mother can.I will read the links, and further investigate the “potato juice” issue.Normally when someone says to me “Cows milk is for baby cows” I say “Ya and bananas are for monkeys.” because the argument is just that silly.That analogy does not make sense, and it is a stretch to make it true. The reason mammals lactate are to feed their young, that’s it. Bananas, which by the way have been selected by man to look the way they are now, do not exist to feed monkeys.So now you want to talk about the meaning of life. The analogy was meant to be funny. Just because baby cows sometimes drink cow’s milk that doesn’t mean we can’t also.Bananas and milk are completely different.Banans are fruit and their existence is a mean for the banana tree to maximize the spread of his seeds.Milk is a particul mammal secretion and his significance is to assure complete nutrition for a baby mammal until he can digest other kind of macro nutrients.And baby mammals are different from each other, or you think that the growth rate of human baby is the same for calf, or baby pigs etc ?Human milk is specific for human babies, while cow’s milk is specific for calf.And a lot of people lose the enzyme needed to drink milkRead about populations that eat a lot of natural “meat” and raw milk:http://healthylongevity.blogspot.it/2013/10/Cardiovascular-Disease-in-Ancient-Civilizations.htmlThey are not disease free.We don’t know what these people where eating and they don’t mention raw milk. Bananas are fruit and their existence is a mean for the banana tree to maximize the spread of his seeds. They are not meant to be food for humans and certainly not a complete and balanced diet.“A lot of people lose the enzyme needed to drink milk?” This is pure speculation. It is an attempt to explain milk protein intolerance. The truth is most lactose intolerants are not lactose malabsorbers and have no problem with raw milk. As a matter of fact most lactose malabsorbers are not lactose intolerant.Did you read the link ?You do not understand the banana example… the fruit it’s a trick for the plant to induce animals (we) to eat it so that they will act as a vehicle and disperse seeds after digestion (even if today cultivars are practically without seeds for selection).Bananas are healthy fruits and can be a part of an healthy diet as many other fruits.Raw milk is not:http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/raw-milk-versus-pasteurized-milk/There are compounds intrinsic of milk, it doe not matter if pasteurized, or not…http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1610-0387.2009.07019.x/pdfMerio, I completely forgot about these. Thanks for digging this up for us. How could I forget about TOR http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-cancer-from-going-on-tor/They do not mention organic raw milk or say that it is the same as processed milk. They don’t say that milk is a carcinogen. They do say anorexia reduces the incidence of breast cancer. Maybe we should recommend an anorexic diet? Are they saying that vegetables are unhealthy for growing children?Raw milk mike, your interpretations are off. Please try and see through your raw milk bias and view what Dr. Greger has shared as well as the studies themselves. The compounds are inherent, there is not an indication that these harms would not occur in organic, raw or conventional.Tox, did you see Merio’s quote “Increased levels of IGF-1 are found in the milk from cows that have been given recombinant growth hormone”? You don’t think Dr. Greger has a bias? A medical doctor is not going to indorse alternative medicine. Anyone switching to raw milk knows there is a difference and it isn’t the taste. Are you sure you aren’t the one with the bias?I still think the bias remains with you, as your username would suggest. Increased IGF-1 in milk from growth hormone does not mean that IGf-1 is not present to begin with, it just means it is further increased with the hormone. Even if IGF-1 were non existent in milk, the body still produces more IGF-1 due to the amino acid ratio of milk.“Milk is a complex fluid that developed over the course of mammalian evolution. Its primary function is to support growth and cell proliferation.” This is not something for humans to be consuming, growth is not an attractive feature as an adult, as this typically translates to unwanted growth.MD stands for MEDICAL doctor not nutritionist. They sell MEDICINE not health-food. We are not just talking about adults but adults require sell growth also. 50,000 of the cells in your body will die and be replaced with new cells, all while you have been reading this sentence! Our bodies are recreating themselves constantly – we make a skeleton every 3 months, new skin every month. 15 million blood cells are destroyed in the human body every second. Every year about 98% of the atoms in your body are replaced. Doesn’t this mean that adults require more cell growth than children?rawmilk mike, these conversations we have are honestly silly, and your arguments are elementary. I think you can figure this one out yourself.“typically translates to unwanted growth in the form of cancer” Tox, you are just making this stuff up as you go. You did not read that anywhere. If this argument is so elementary why is it so difficult for you? “Normal cells are mortal, that is, they have a life span.” Cancer cells “essentially become immortal.” http://lungcancer.about.com/od/Biology-of-Cancer/a/Cancer-Cells-Normal-Cells.htmrawmilk mike, I have already shared with you the links to see the easy to understand explanations from Dr. Greger.

Proper nutrition is a much better way to fight cancer than starvation. Kids get cancer to and not all cancers involve growth. Cancer growth is actually a lack of cell death. http://lungcancer.about.com/od/Biology-of-Cancer/a/Cancer-Cells-Normal-Cells.htm Didn’t you see Merio’s quote “Increased levels of IGF-1 are found in the milk from cows that have been given recombinant growth hormone”? They also say anorexia reduces the incidence of breast cancer. Maybe we should recommend starvation as a way to prevent cancer? You should do a search on “cancer and the immune system”. Industrialization is just as bad for a plant based diet as it is for an animal based diet. Humans can’t live on Coca-Cola and Chips Ahoy any better than on ice cream and chocolate milk.if you wanna join the debate, it’s not a problem… i’m only a “biotechnologist”, human nutrition it’s only a free time activity… :-)As a “biotechnologist” what products are you working on? What is your area of expertise?Technically speaking ? In nothing :-)I have a 3 years degree in Biotechnology and now i’m working on my Master program that is related to biotechnology applications to human disease.My thesis was much more molecular/structural and focused on a particular type of enzymes:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HydrogenaseSo you’re just a kid.I do not know… how many kids do you know with an University Biotechnology degree ?Normally when people grow up they get a job. And what’s with your English? “with an University Biotechnology degree”?? “I have a 3 years degree in Biotechnology”?? “i’m”?? “wanna”?? “Yes, to this (your) reply”?? “it doe not matter”?? “it’s an hormone”?? “naturalling occurring”?? “Here is to you a site that is highly critic with raw milk”??

You don’t need to take your nutrients from milk but you shouldn’t criticize people that do. We have enough trouble with the government. If you don’t have easy access to raw milk then yes pasteurized milk is not only useless but very dangerous. There are not that many options for obtaining B12.Ok !Best regards !Your english is fine Merio. I find that if you dont feed a troll then it will go away.Oh, thanks for your reply Coacervate, but it’s not a problem really.I have seen all kind of trolls (much more in political debate) and they do not bother me.:-)Just because we can eat bananas doesn’t mean we can live on them. Bananas are a healthy fruit and can be “PART” of a healthy diet as are many other fruits. Saying that cow’s milk is perfectly balanced for cows only means that it could theoretically be a problem for human infants less than 6 months old. I haven’t been able to find any study that shows that raw cows milk is any worse than infant formula.“The researchers basically concluded that the impact of pasteurization on the nutritive value of milk APPEARS to be MINIMAL.” According to the nutrition label on the side of the carton.The people saying raw milk is a super-food are raw milk consumers who know this to be a fact. The propaganda comes from raw milks competitors.All it says is “Consumption of cow’s milk and cow’s milk protein result in changes of the hormonal axis of insulin, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor – 1(IGF-1) in humans.” It doesn’t say what “compounds are intrinsic to milk”. Where do you get the idea it doesn’t matter if it is organic raw milk or not? And it doesn’t say that IGF-1 causes cancer. Anorexia reduces the incidence of breast cancer. Maybe we should recommend an anorexic diet?Who said that we can lived on them, uh ?The people saying raw milk is a super-food are raw milk consumers who know this to be a fact. The propaganda comes from raw milks competitors.Are there any papers about that ? Or just opinions ?All it says is “Consumption of cow’s milk and cow’s milk protein result in changes of the hormonal axis of insulin, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor – 1(IGF-1) in humans.” It doesn’t say what “compounds are intrinsic to milk”. Where do you get the idea it doesn’t matter if it is organic raw milk or not? And it doesn’t say that IGF-1 causes cancer. Anorexia reduces the incidence of breast cancer. Maybe we should recommend an anorexic diet?You missed this part:[…]Milk is a complex bioactive secretion that plays an important role in enhancing growth and in the development of newborn mammals. Human beings are the only mammals that have access to milk and dairy products over the life span. Cow’s milk contains a number of bioactive hormones including IGF-1 (4–50 ng/ml) and IGF-2 (40–50 ng/ml) [57, 58]. IGF-1, an important stimulator of lactogenesis, is secreted into milk. Increased levels of IGF-1 are found in the milk from cows that have been given recombinant growth hormone to increase milk production [58]. Pasteurization and homogenization do nothing to significantly decrease IGF-1 activity [59]. Bovine and human IGF-1 are identical and bind with the same affinity to human IGF1R.It’s in the chapter titled “Increased serum levels of IGF-1 as a result of milk consumption”http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-and-organic-milk-vs-almond-milk/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18703307It’s important for cow’s metabolism:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18703307Like cholesterol, casein (do you know the China Study ?), and many other compounds… or microorganisms:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3461852/Thank you for proving my point. I missed that. “Increased levels of IGF-1 are found in the milk from cows that have been given recombinant growth hormone to increase milk production”maybe you do not understand the fact that there was ALREADY a IGF 1 level that with the use of an external hormone increase because that is the aim of the hormone.Or maybe you think that IGF 1 came out or nothing ?The hormone act on a pathway that is already there.Do you understand that ?“Do you understand that ?” your previous statement “There are compounds intrinsic of milk, it doe not matter if pasteurized, or not…” contradicts your quote “Increased levels of IGF-1 are found in the milk from cows that have been given recombinant growth hormone” because organic raw milk does not have “recombinant growth hormone” like the milk referred to in your study/opinion peace.No it is not… simply because IGF1 is a natural occurring compound found in mammals and their milk.The quote is this:Milk is a complex bioactive secretion that plays an important role in enhancing growth and in the development of newborn mammals. Human beings are the only mammals that have access to milk and dairy products over the life span. Cow’s milk contains a number of bioactive hormones including IGF-1 (4–50 ng/ml) and IGF-2 (40–50 ng/ml) [57, 58]. IGF-1, an important stimulator of lactogenesis, is secreted into milk .

Pasteurization and homogenization do nothing to significantly decrease IGF-1 activity [59]. Bovine and human IGF-1 are identical and bind with the same affinity to human IGF1R.IGF 1 it’s an hormone that is found in mammals and have various actions and it’s completely normal to have it both for cows and humans.The rBGH mimic the naturalling occurring cow’s hormone (BGH) to enhance the normal IGF 1 levels and promotes milk production.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18420611So IGF1 it’s intrinsic to our metabolism, like cholesterol, or C-reactive protein.Some intrinsic compounds are “natural”, while others were made by us and contaminate the life cycle:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutantHere is to you a site that is highly critic with raw milk:http://www.realrawmilkfacts.com/raw-milk-hot-topicsIs this suppose to be a response to something I said?Yes, to this (your) reply:“Do you understand that ?” your previous statement “There are compounds intrinsic of milk, it doe not matter if pasteurized, or not…” contradicts your quote “Increased levels of IGF-1 are found in the milk from cows that have been given recombinant growth hormone” because organic raw milk does not have “recombinant growth hormone” like the milk referred to in your opinion peace. Are you suggesting our IGF-1 level should be zero?I turned 61 years old this year. My Mother could not breastfeed her 4 children because she had the rare condition of inverted nipples which would not allow suckling. I was raised on pasturized/homogenized cows milk. I did not get sick and die and neither did my three brothers. I did, however, switch to a whole foods plant based diet (no meat, no dairy) 6 years ago when my cholesterol shot high, when I developed gout, prediabetes, beginning osteopenia and carried 30 extra lbs being officially overweight. After the diet change I am now normal in every medical test and have returned to a normal weight of 135 on my 5’7″ frame. My friend, Jeff, at 69 years, suffered from Type II diabetes for the last 9 years. Jeff, as well, read China Study and, with his doctors help, switched to a WFPB diet. Two months later his doctor declared him free of his Type II and he is off all medications as well as saving the $500/month he spent on medicine. His physician read China Study as well and his clinic now treats all their Type II diabetics completely differently. His physician: “I was never taught any of this in medical school.” Re: milks. . the protein content of cows milk is 14%, rat – 49%, human being – .08 to 09%. Fat content of human mother’s milk is approx 3-5%. Whales – also a mammal – have mother’s milk fat content of approx. 40%. Milks are species specific and are not interchangeable. The ONLY mammal that continues to suckle after weaning is the human being .. which continues to suckle at the (removed) breast of the cow. Even cows don’t drink cows milk after infancy. Pasturized, raw, chocolatized, or concentrated into cheese (remember, it takes approx 8 gallons of milk to make one pound of cheese – concentrated saturated fat), cows milk has no biological place or role in human being health.Geb. Thanks for sharing your story and that of your friend to inspire others. Wishing you both continued good health.He would have had the same results simply switching to raw dairy. Also losing weight can lead to yo-yo dieting.Evidence?Look who’s talking. The pot calling the kettle black.Don’t you troll from 10 to 7 Mon thru Fri? Are your working overtime now?Valerie says: I avoid dairy at all cost. My son is off of it. It makes his skin erupt terribly. It is bloating, full of mucus and blood and there is nothing nutritional about it.Rawmilkmike says: That’s only true of pasteurized milk.Toxins says: Inherent compounds exist in milk that are irrelevant to how the milk is prepared.Notice how you changed the subject and I fell for it. You never really disagreed with my initial post.You post one word and I waste 2 days answering a question you never asked. Well done.Geg, you started out disagreeing but then proved my point. You would have died from pasteurized milk.You would have died as an infant if it weren’t for fortified baby formula. “By the 1920s, feeding of orange juice and cod liver oil greatly decreased the incidence of scurvy and rickets.” In other words doctors have known for nearly 100 years that pasteurized cows milk gives infants scurvy and rickets.“A good recommendation is to wean calves at 4 to 5 weeks of age.” “On bottle calves, I offer hay to them on day 3 as well as a handful of grain.” So calves don’t die from pasteurized milk either. But they would if they didn’t have another source of nutrition.Milks are species specific but so are plants. Not all mammals can live on bamboo. You apparently have not researched raw milk or infant formula. Human health appears to be a mystery to you.Geg, I apologize for the flippant nature of my previous post but I still can not think of a pleasant way to make what I believe to be seven very important points.Maybe if I elaborate on 4 of them: Pandas can live on bamboo. Humans can’t. Cows can live on grass, Humans can’t.You didn’t say anything specifically about raw milk. Suggesting that you have no hard evidence showing that raw milk could have caused any of you and your friends health problems.Saying that you were fed exclusively cows milk as an infant suggest that you may not know what was being fed to infants in the 50s.To suggest that cooked and homogenized milk, today’s mutant plants, and a lack of healthy fats did not cause any of you and your friends very serious health issue but that only cooked meat did, gives the impression you don’t really know what caused those illnesses. Hence the use of the word mystery.The T. Colin Campbell Foundation is offering an on-line certificate program in Plant-Based Nutrition for 30 CME credits to doctors to learn about many important and life-saving facts, such as that a majority of people on certain councils and boards in Washington, D.C. are being paid by the “industry” (dairy and beef), and so many have stock in the industry or other ways of being connected to it, that there is no freedom to vote on decisions that affect every the health and longevity of every baby born. Even international policies are being ‘sold to the highest bidder’, as far as the unhealthy amounts of protein, sugars, and fat that are recommended. Dr. Campbell has been a member of these committees, and had to actually sue some of them to disclose these awful facts to the general public. These organizations that are supposed to keep us and our innocent children safe have sold out.. http://www.tcolincampbell.orgI think it’s an interesting program and health professional should be aware of it… as a former Biotechnology student (i got the degree in February) and now Medical Biotechnology student i will be interest in this kind of certificate just for my passion of Human Nutrition but now i have to focusing on my master program and lab skills. Maybe in the future i will invest more deeply in the nutrition field.That is all very true but don’t forget corn, soy, and pharmaceuticals. Most importantly don’t forget that the plant based diet lobby is also guilty of spreading the same propaganda about raw milk.Who is this plant based lobby you speak of? Do you know where government subsidies go?Have you seen the food pyramid?“Although I often use the terms “support” and “subsidy” interchangeably, much government support of agriculture is not in the form of direct subsidy for farmer incomes or direct subsidy for production, but is indirect.Economists have criticized farm subsidies on several counts. First, farm subsidies typically transfer income from consumers and taxpayers to relatively wealthy farmland owners and farm operators. Second, they impose net losses on society, often called deadweight losses, and have no clear broad social benefit (Alston and James 2002). Third, they impede movements toward more open international trade in commodities and thus impose net costs on the global economy (Johnson 1991; Sumner 2003).”“The U.S. government heavily subsidizes grains, oil-seeds, cotton, sugar, and pasteurized dairy products.”The few subsidies for grains, soy and corn go to feed the animals primarily, lets not pretend otherwise. http://www.pcrm.org/pdfs/health/perverse%20pyramid.pdfSo besides oil-seeds, cotton, sugar, and pasteurized dairy products, we are also subsidizing beef and poultry production. What is your point?“Who is this plant based lobby you speak of?” The pharmaceutical industry and anyone not selling animal products.“Do you know where government subsidies go?” Yes, to McDonald’s, Walmart, and anyone else selling products made from these commodities.Maybe a babies milk should come from a human and not a cow. I’m just saying, Johnny.Dear Dr Greger – Here in Australia we are currently seeing ads on TV extolling the virtues of milk with the A2 protein and not the A1 protein. The claim is that those who have an upset tummy from A1 Milk can drink A2 without any problems. Do you have any research on this point?The only milk an infant should drink I believe is breast milk as nature intended. My excessive milk consumption while pregnant and nursing flared up my eczema until a naturopath discovered I was intolerant to it. Went off dairy and healed my gastritis and no more steroid creams for eczema and no more constipation for my daughter. I cringe when I see kids drinking milk now and all these giant kids and pre pubescent girls? Marketing at it’s finest. Terrible.I have a thought for those people who think that consuming any kind of dairy after weening is a good idea. In other words, this site encourages breast feeding for human infants if at all possible. But what if you are no longer drinking your mother’s breast milk? Does it make sense to drink the breast milk of other species? Is it really natural and healthy?1) To my knowledge, humans are the only animals on the entire planet who suckle past weening – and not only that, but do so with the breast milk of other species.2) While drinking dairy milk is natural for infant mammals, with one exception, we all loose the ability to properly digest diary milk after weening. The one exception is a small subset of humans who have mutated to be able to properly digest dairy milk even after weening.I’ve seen various numbers about how many humans can properly digest dairy. The numbers usually range from 15% to 25%. That means at least 75% of humans experience mild to sever problems consuming dairy – and most of those humans are people of color:“According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, 60-80 percent of African Americans, 50-80 percent of Latinos, and at least 90 percent of Asians and Native Americans are lactose intolerant and may suffer stomach cramps, diarrhea, and other painful or distressing gastrointestinal symptoms. Lactose intolerance occurs in 6-22 percent of people of northern European descent.” from: http://www.pcrm.org/media/news/spoof-of-milk-mustache-ad-reaches-out-to-people——————————– So, here’s my thought: Suppose you want to completely ignore the giant and compelling body of evidence that shows how terribly unhealthy it is for humans past weening to consume all forms of dairy (raw or otherwise). And suppose you want to completely ignore global climate change and human and non-human animal suffering caused by the dairy industry. Just based on understanding the above two points alone, we can see that any philosophy or theory of eating that indiscriminately includes dairy as healthy for consumption is inherently racist.That is worth taking some serious time to think about.Our daughter when she was a baby had terrible constipation. She would cry all the time and we as a result got very little sleep. We tried everything to try resolve the problem including laxities, enemas. Doctors weren’t much help. Our daughter was breast fed so we didn’t even think about the milk. Our daughter got a cold with a lot of congestion so my wife decided eliminate yogurt, cheese etc to help her recover from the cold. Within days she had no more constipation and we were getting sleep :). My wife also gave up dairy which we felt helped alleviate the problem. I wish the sort of information on this website was more widely available.Is anyone aware of any research on adults? For milk, but also other diary products (yoghrut, cheese, etc.)? thanks!Hi Dani, to get you started search on dairy, yogurt, cheese, etc. scroll through the videos to find you are most interested in.For examples:http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=dairy http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-and-organic-milk-vs-almond-milk/http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/27/want-to-help-prevent-parkinsons-disease-avoid-this/There are over 9 million raw milk consumers in America. Ask around you’ll be surprised how many you find. When you find one that has switched from pasteurized milk ask them about the health benefits they have witnessed.There are 10 million raw milk consumers in America. Ask around you’ll be surprised how many you find. When you find one that has switched from pasteurized milk ask them about the health benefits.I avoid dairy at all cost. My son is off of it. It makes his skin erupt terribly. It is bloating, full of mucus and blood and there is nothing nutritional about it.That’s only true of pasteurized milk.Inherent compounds exist in milk that are irrelevant to how the milk is prepared. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/This video is also filled with unsubstantiated speculation.Not all dairies use Holstein cows and not all dairies keep their cows pregnant and not all dairies use rBGH. There’s a big difference between small raw milk dairies and large pasteurized milk dairies.They don,t refer specifically to raw milk or any raw animal products for that matter.Recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) and antibiotics are given to animals, such as cattle and chickens in order to make them gain weight faster. Growth hormones also increase milk production in animals. These hormones may hold negative health repercussions for humans. Early puberty in girls has been associated with certain growth hormones used in meat and dairy products.Xenoestrogens have been implicated here, which is present in milk. These are natural compounds that appear in milk. Growth hormones from human sources is not what is being discussed. Also, xenoestrogens are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the harmful effects of milk. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-intake-and-igf-1-production/ Good luck finding a study showing decreased rates of cancer with increasing consumption of milk. I understand you are passionate about raw milk, but here at nutritionfacts.org we use an evidence based approach and do not come to dietary conclusions based on emotion or feelings. Please present studies to back up your claims.First, you are the one forcing others to buy your product. You are the one with the burden of proof. Implication is not proof. Where is your empirical evidence? “Growth hormones from human sources” can just as easily explain the results of your studies. They show increased rates of cancer with increasing consumption of pasteurized milk, not raw milk. Don’t try and create a straw-man. — What you use is a lack of “evidence based approach” by saying you have not published any recent studies that show raw milk is safe and beneficial. That doesn’t mean you haven’t published the them in the past or that there aren’t present day studies that you choose not to publish. — Like all salesmen you get emotional when your sales pitch is ignored. Your own evidence does not support your accusations. Your data suggests that raw milk is a safe alternative treatment for illness. It’s results speak for themselves. Passion has nothing to do with it. — A person drinking raw milk has no need for speculation and is immune to much of the propaganda from competing pharmaceutical salesmen. A person switching to raw milk often sees imitate results with continued improvements in health over the weeks, mouths, and years to follow. — Let’s see the rest of the iceberg. “is likely due to” “Now it appears we know why” “and ask why” “Higher Quality May Mean Higher Risk.” This is the best link you could come up with? — “About NutritionFacts.org”“Whenever there is a new drug or surgical procedure, you can be assured that you or your doctor will probably hear about it because there’s a corporate budget driving its promotion. But what about advances in the field of nutrition? The reason we don’t see ads on TV for broccoli(or raw milk) is the same reason groundbreaking research on the power of foods and eating patterns to affect our health and longevity gets lost and buried in the medical literature–there’s no profit motive. It may not make anyone money, but what if our lives would profit?”“GH and IGF levels are both elevated dramatically following exercise”“IGF-I in children have been associated with higher IQ”“Its deficit can cause hearing loss. Serum level of it also underlies a correlation between short height and reduced hearing abilities particularly around 3–5 years of age, and at age 18 (late puberty).”I fear you have completely missed the point, to each his own I suppose.The point is that humans are not herbivores. Your data only shows that raw food is healthier than processed food and on that we can agree. What you do not seem to comprehend is that raw and fermented animal products are more natural and even healthier than raw and ferment plants. Your data does not address this issue. Do you know anything about the traditional diets of Eskamos and native Americans?I apologize raw milk mike, but I cannot further this conversation if you continue to not support your claims with evidence and if you continue to ignore the presented videos I have shared. Don’t let your passion for raw milk blind you from considering opposing arguments. You may think you are “in the know”, but it is apparent you have seen a small fraction of the videos Dr. Greger has shared. Please continue your research. Yes I am well aware of the Eskimos, their diet and lifestyle is not something I would idolize.Tox, you took the words right out of my mouth. Who’s idolizing the Eskimos diet and what do we know about their lifestyle? If you are well aware of the Eskimos diet then you know it disproves Dr. Greger’s theories.Clearly you are misinformed.“The data collected through this new investigation shows that Eskimos do have a similar prevalence of [coronary artery disease] CAD to non-Eskimo populations, and in fact, they have very high rates of mortality due to cerebrovascular events (strokes). Overall, their life expectancy is approximately 10 years less than the typical Danish population and their overall mortality is twice as high as that of non-Eskimo populations.”http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/investigators-find-something-fishy-with-the-classical-evidence-for-dietary-fish-recommendationsIt is in line with the evidence shared. Furthermore, Dr. Greger has no “theory”, he is simply stating what the evidence has to say. You are the one who has a problem with it, which is clearly why you are so defensive. You cannot fight good science with whimsical ideas.Tox, I said “Do you know anything about the traditional diets of Eskimos and native Americans?” No where in your link do they say anything about “the traditional diet of Eskimo”. To the contrary, they are referring to their current diet. Eskimos didn’t cook their food before the Europeans came to this continent and unlike us they ate the entire animal. Their diet was not high protein. It was high fat. 80% fat calories and almost zero carbs.Dr. Greger’s doesn’t specifically say anything. He uses terms like: “May have” “May be why” “Particular concern” “Could be” “They think” “Important theme” “Hormone dependent cancers” not “cancers caused by hormones” “Commercial cows milk” not “Organic raw milk” “Estrogen dependent malignant diseases” not “malignant diseases caused by estrogen” “Cow’s milk and cheese” when he is actually referring to “Pasteurized cow’s milk and cheese”. Good science or whimsical ideas?His data suggests that children need to eat more meat than adults and that animal fat may be more important than animal protein.Again, you have failed to present evidence that raw makes any difference in terms of animal foods and milk. Once you do, we can get somewhere. Otherwise you are just gong to repeat the same unjustified ideas and I am going to continue to not believe you.It may appear that I’m trying to sell raw milk but in reality I’m just trying to buy it. We just want to be left alone but we are constantly under attack. Tox, you are the one who has failed to present evidence to support your theories.You say some of the silliest things. Do I really need to present evidence that there is a difference between raw and processed foods. If you are going to insist that they are the same I think you may again be the one with the burden of proof.Again you have not responded to a thing I’ve said. You ignored all ten points and now you want to discus whether there is a difference between raw and processed foods.Your points were not valid. I talked about the inherent xenoestrogens present in milk whether it be raw or not. All you did was retort with a bunch of ideas on why I am wrong without presenting evidence. I then shared that consuming milk is not helpful due to its IGF-1 raising effect, you retorted that low igf-1 is unhealthy, which does not have anything to do with the issues I raised, its just a distraction. I have already done my part, you are the one who does not want to listen.My points were related to the link you posted. I assumed it was meant to support your position. “Bunch of ideas” ? It’s called logic. I have evidence out the wazoo. What evidence are you looking for? You are the one with no evidence. Quoting unsubstantiated accusations from people with a clear conflict of interest is not evidence.Retort: a quick, witty, or cutting reply; especially : one that turns back or counters the first speaker’s words. Why thank you.It’s silly to say “consuming milk is not helpful due to its IGF-1 raising effect”. IGF-1 is not a carcinogen and it would not negate raw milk’s numerous health benefits even if it were.Eskimos have been consuming European junk food for the last 100 years. To say that their lifespans are now worse than the rest of us is off topic since the subject was their traditional raw food diet.If you bothered to see the video link and do a bit of research, just a bit, which you have not, you would see that elevated IGF-1, which milk is the greatest offender for, is cancerous. If oyu have evidence than sahre it, again you choose to share whimisical ideas which you refer to as “logic”.You must have forgotten my earlier post. “Dr. Greger’s doesn’t specifically say anything. He uses terms like: “May have” “May be why” “Particular concern” “Could be” “They think” “Important theme” “Hormone dependent cancers” not “cancers caused by hormones” “Commercial cows milk” not “Organic raw milk” “Estrogen dependent malignant diseases” not “malignant diseases caused by estrogen” “Cow’s milk and cheese” when he is actually referring to “Pasteurized cow’s milk and cheese”. Good science or whimsical ideas?”Look at your non-statement: “elevated IGF-1, which milk is the greatest offender for, is cancerous.” IGF-1 promotes cell growth. it doesn’t cause cancer.When you have a mass of evidence you can make links like this.Why do centenarians escape or postpone cancer?The role of IGF-1, inXammation and p53http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CD0QFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F23783106_Why_do_centenarians_escape_or_postpone_cancer_The_role_of_IGF-1_inflammation_and_p53%2Ffile%2F9fcfd50602fb925e23.pdf&ei=7wg0UZGhB-TXygGR_oBA&usg=AFQjCNFnC614zJS8Cqay3CHjkv8erNuRBA&sig2=XWuAw4GoFQ-broz9X8o_uA&bvm=bv.43148975,d.aWcCell growth is determined primarily by the growth hormone Insulin like growth factor, also called IGF-1. As a child, this growth hormone is found in much larger amounts and then slowly tapers off during adulthood. Increased levels of circulating IGF-1 as adults can promote unwanted growth, particularly in the form of tumors. An association can be seen in the following meta-analysis between increased IGF-1 levels and prostate cancer. “Our meta-analysis revealed that the body of the world-wide published literature is consistent with an average 21% increased risk of prostate cancer per standard deviation increase in IGF-I”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2743036/A similar association is revealed between increased IGF-1 levels and breast cancer “The results of this collaborative analysis show that plasma concentrations of IGF1 are positively associated with breast-cancer risk.”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3113287/?tool=pubmedElevated IGF-1 has also been shown to increase the chance of the cancer to metastasis. This hormone is responsible for cancer proliferation, survival, migration and angiogenesis (feeding cancer with blood supply)http://edrv.endojournals.org/content/30/1/51.full.pdf+htmlIGF-1 deficiency leads to dwarfism and one might expect this group of the population to not get cancer, as is the case. “The individuals with GHR deficiency (GHRD) exhibited only one non-lethal malignancy and no cases of diabetes, in contrast to 17% cancer and 5% diabetes prevalence in the controls.”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3357623/“Fasting serum was obtained from postmenopausal women participants at the Pritkin Longevity Center Residential Program where they were placed on a low-fat (10-15% Kcal), high-fiber (less than 40 gm/d) diet and attended daily exercise classes for 2 weeks.” They used the blood of this group and dripped it on cancer cell lines. Significant cell death was observed as well as reduced IGF-1 levels in the blood. http://www.pritikin.com/eperspective/specialissues/cancer/cancerabstract.pdfIn an attempt to “determine the underlying mechanisms for these anticancer effects”, cell apoptosis was again to be examined when the blood of a group eating a similar diet was dripped on a cancer cell line. What made this study so remarkable, was that not only did cancer cells die off in greater abundance when IGF-1 levels were lowered through diet, but that the cell death benefits were nulled when the researchers put back the IGF-1 into the blood and re dripped it on the cell line. It was also discovered that IGFBP-1, the protein that binds up the IGF-1 hormone, was found in greater quantities on a low fat, high fiber diet. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3135793/pdf/ECAM2011-529053.pdf“The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether a plant-based (vegan) diet is associated with a lower circulating level of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) compared with a meat-eating or lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet among 292 British women, ages 20 –70 years” It was found that vegetarians and omnivores had very similar numbers in terms of IGF-1 levels, and one truly has to eliminate all animal products to have optimal levels of IGF-1 and IGFPB-1.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2374537/pdf/83-6691152a.pdf“These considerations enable the prediction that a low-fat vegan diet will be profoundly protective with respect to risk for postmenopausal breast cancer. The protein content of this diet will preferentially support glucagon activity and possibly decrease IGF-I synthesis.”http://img2.timg.co.il/forums/1_155647027.pdf“In summary, these results suggest that total IGF-I concentration is lower among women who adopt a vegan diet. In addition, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 concentrations are substantially higher in vegan women compared with meat-eaters and vegetarians, suggesting that the amount of bioavailable IGF-I may be lower in vegan women. The nutritional characteristics of the vegan diet that account for these differences are not clear but may be related to vegans’ lower intake of protein high in essential amino acids. These results suggest that even when total protein intake is not notably low, a low intake of essential amino acids, as typically found in a plant-based diet, may be sufficient to reduce serum IGF-I and increase serum IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 levels.”http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/11/11/1441.full.pdfMilk indeed raises igf-1 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10524386?dopt=AbstractPlus http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2127785/Thus we can conclude that milk can promote cancer growth, these are not whimsical ideas like the ones you present.Tox, I appreciate the effort but you evidently did not read any of this link.Abstract BackgroundCentenarians are exceptionally long living individuals who escaped the most common age-related diseases. In particular they appear to be effectively protected from cancers. The mechanisms that underlie this protection are quite complex and still largely unclear.Conclusion As discussed along this paper, it appears that centenarians are protected from cancer by at least two different mechanisms: low IGF-1-mediated responses and elevated production of anti-inflammatory mediators. This can be likely due to individual genetic variants…http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CD0QFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F23783106_Why_do_centenarians_escape_or_postpone_cancer_The_role_of_IGF-1_inflammation_and_p53%2Ffile%2F9fcfd50602fb925e23.pdf&ei=7wg0UZGhB-TXygGR_oBA&usg=AFQjCNFnC614zJS8Cqay3CHjkv8erNuRBA&sig2=XWuAw4GoFQ-broz9X8o_uA&bvm=bv.43148975,d.aWcHold on now. So all you are saying is “Thus we can conclude that milk can promote cancer growth.” If this is your only point it isn’t much of a disagreement. So you are not talking about raw milk or what actually causes cancer?Again raw milk mike, your citation does nothing to bolster your claim or diminish mine, if anything it further reinforces my claim that elevated IGF-1 is linked with decreased longevity. What is your point? Yes all milk does this, even raw. Your efforts to pick apart the studies as if they were faulty is unwarranted.Tox, if you are not saying that raw milk causes cancer then we do not have a disagreement. So is that what you are saying or not.Also, originally Valerie said “dairy makes his skin erupt terribly. It is bloating, full of mucus and blood and there is nothing nutritional about it.” and I said “That’s only true of pasteurized milk.” Are you disagreeing with that or not? Are you saying that raw milk “would have maked his skin erupt terribly. It is bloating, full of mucus and blood and there is nothing nutritional about it.”Tox, you didn’t read this one either:ConclusionEven though we observed a modest increase in risk of prostate cancer associated with higher levels of IGF-I, and a slight reduced risk with higher levels of IGFBP-3, neither of these peptides are likely to be useful as additional measurements in prostate cancer PSA screening. The strength of the associations are too weak to have any value as a screening test, because at these odds ratios, the detection rate (sensitivity) is less than 8% for a 95% specificity (5% false positive rate)http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2743036/Do I really need to go through all of them?Rawmilkmike, do you understand what you are citing? It is basically saying that if you have high igf-1 it does not mean that cancer is present. PSA screening tests cancer by-products. This does not mean that elevated IGF-1 does not lead to the development of cancer. Elevated IGF-1 is universally understood to be strongly related with increased cancer rates, this is not an issue in question.If this link does not say that IGF-1 causes cancer why did you post it? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2743036/You are not understanding my posts nor your own citations from them. Alas, to each his own.“Twenty-two consumer groups including the Physicians for Social Responsibility have endorsed a ban on artificial growth hormones in dairy cows. They cite studies that indicate treated cows produce milk with an increased second hormone, IGF-1″http://www.mindfully.org/GE/2005/Monsanto-Posilac-rBGH18feb05.htmWhich is it? A misunderstanding or a difference of opinion?This:- “…cure constipation in up to 100% of kids tested,…” is rather vague, it could be 1%. In which case you’re just spreading misinformation. In fact, reading through a few of your citations (picking those in the last ten years), most groups are small and those that do report cows milk intolerance specifically are around 30-50% in cases of constipation. Statements like yours are why the public are losing faith in science.I’ve been regularly constipated all my life since I was a baby, even on a vegetarian diet (I have always been disgusted by the idea of eating meat). I supplement with B12 and omega after watching your video’s btw. A year ago I stopped eating gluten and I was so relieved to have my chronic headache disappear within two weeks. However, my constipation got much worse! After seeing your video on childhood constipation and cow’s milk, I got new hope. I stopped eating and drinking any milk containing product at all. The little that still remained from my headaches now got even better, so thank you for that! However, the constipation continued, and the over-the-counter as well as the prescription laxatives are having little to no effect anymore. I finally insisted my GP (who didn’t take my constipation problems very seriously) to refer me to a specialist and I’m awaiting the blood tests after finishing the required gluten challenge. The only thing that is keeping me out of the ER right now is a daily dose of what people normally get to empty their bowels before a colonoscopy, together with a suppository. The other day, I found out that there is something called Hirschsprung’s disease, which seems quite similar to my situation. That gave me some hope that maybe I don’t have to live with this pain and medication for the rest of my life. But I’m very worried about again getting the wrong diagnosis and treatment, or no treatment at all. Therefore I’d love to hear from your experience whether you think it’s at all possible that such a severe constipation can still be food-related, or that there must be some kind of physical obstruction causing it, such as Hirschsprung’s.My son just turned 1 and is no longer using breast milk. We are giving soy milk to our daughter which is 3 but I am concerned about the female estrogen found in soy milk. Any suggestions what to use that has enough protein and calcium?Hi Shawn. You are of course free to choose whatever beverage you think is best, but I may suggest that soymilk does not boost estrogen levels or decrease male fertility. Dr. Greger addresses a safe amount here. I published a paper on cancer with a topic on soy titled Applying the Precautionary Principle to Nutrition and Cancer. If you do want to avoid soy you could try almond milk with added pea protein. It does exist on the market and has calcium. Hope this helps.Joseph: I didn’t realize you have published papers. Very cool! And I like the premise of the one that you linked to above. It just makes so much sense.

In the end, setting a good example is the most powerful persuasion.You are so right about setting a good example. I am diabetic and I have several diabetic relatives, one of which is now experiencing increasing insulin resistance and diabetic complications. All of this is occurring after years of carefully following their doctor’s advice and taking their medications.He lost weight from walking every day and eating “better”, avoided sweets and took his medications. He progressed to eventually go on insulin. Now doctors are having trouble getting his sugars under control at all and he is starting to show some kidney damage. But how can this be?He traded in the carbs for fat. Meat, cheese, yogurt etc have all been his staples. I was diagnosed recently. My sugars have been improving on a plant-based diet without the use of any medications. I believe he can still turn things around, but I don’t believe he will listen if I don’t show him. My desire to motivate him keeps me on track.If you’re worried about a loved one, be their inspiration. If you can’t be, find someone who can. Brow-beating doesn’t work, but I believe good information and inspiration definitely can.Penny T: Thanks for your post.

(This Google search link shows images of this lentil: http://j.mp/1lvp4ai). Using the pressure cooker, I simply add one cup of lentils with three cups of water and throw in a few mustard seeds and cumin seeds, which I image only add a bit of flavor and fiber and aren’t digested or included in calorie counts…). Pressurize for 8 minutes, and then 8 more on the cooling cycle, and then stir briskly to form a creamy texture. It’s the easiest, most tasty bean that I’ve come across… Into the frigo for daily consumption over the next few days…Tobias: Nice! Thanks for sharing. I think I’ve seen those beans in the bulk section of the store I usually visit. Now I’m tempted to give them a try. I have a pressure cooker and those seeds you mentioned. It sounds simple. Why not! Thanks again.I would suggest trying them in sambar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambar_%28dish%29There are many incredible recipes for sambar, are easily adapted (no oil or ghee) The result is wonderful. But my favorite lentil is still masoor daal (red lentils) for it. :)And they happen to be the better ones. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-lentil/With Madras curry (I like Sharwoods) besides more spices. And I am still in love with basmati rice… Many variations possible.I bought a pound of Mung beans a couple of months ago and have yet to use them so I’ll give this a go. Thanks for sharing.It tastes great plain but seasonings that I’ve used include: Pepper, nutritional yeast, curry, soy sauce, garlic, ginger… Sometimes I cook it initially with tomatoes.Yellow split moong dal is widely used in South Indian dishes and is easily available in large quantities in an Indian grocery store. For more ideas on how to cook them, google to Indian cuisine recipes online.Mung green beans are also my favourites. I get them usually in Indian shops in zone 3 in Upton Park in London. They come in 4 varieties: whole small, Whole big, crushed with skin left, and with no skin. The latter one cooks in no time. The other three need a good soaking 12 hours. I was told by an Indian mum it is better to follow this soaking methods as there is no ‘gas’ formation during digestion time. The red ones are also great. I have bought them whole only. These mung beans are so versatile I find them a delicacy. Bon apetit!I use a lot of canned beans (red and white kidney, chickpeas), and I cook from scratch lentils, split peas and mung beans. Does anyone have a comment on the digestibility/palatability of beans cooked to a “mush,” versus “firm” beans as you might find in a can? Thanks.I’ve read that long slow cooking makes beans more digestable but don’t know for sure. Only know that I really like soft beans in their own nice thick juice.About digestible thank you of beans has more to do with your digestive system than the beans themselves. Actually it is a great diagnostic tool to know the state of your digestive system, add beansI prefer beans as mush as long as it’s got flavor. One of my standards is “refried” beans: beans slow-cooked with onion, garlic, and spices, then mashed with a potato masher. I can’t really provide comparative data on digestibility, but I have no problems after eating 8-12 oz. of the mush.(Despite what some say, there are really only two food groups: the mushy group and the crunchy group.)what about type 1 diabetes?Beans are great, but for those with Type 1 or 1 1/2 Diabetes, and kidney disease, too much protein (even though veggie protein is less harmful than animal) can be a problem…Mikestarchy diet improves insulin sensitivity so T1D patients end up needing less insulinMy 91 year old mother has type II diabetes and is on dialysis.

I would be very interested to hear your take on it overall, and in particular this one of the 12 key points –” Dietary total and saturated fats do not correlate with risk of cardiovascular disease. ”http://www.uab.edu/news/innovation/item/4997-low-carb-diet-recommended-for-diabeticsThe only way to really know the effect of beans on one-self is using a glucometer. In my experience they are pretty bad for post-prandial sugar. On the other hand, I don’t undertand what’s supposed to show the graph of minute 3. This graph compares beans with white rice. The latter rises quite a lot the blood sugar. So yes, comparing beans with white rise, or directly with table sugar, they don’t look awful for sugar control.Ah, and the phytates in the beans don not make them specially attractive.i believe is the glycemic index in lentils, for example (which by the way lentils have one of the lowest glyc indexes), that helps in avoiding those nasty hyperglycemic peaksyes, soaked lentils in an acid medium (to remove phytates) is problably the best election to avoid sugar spikes as for legumes.santiago37: You may want to re-think your aversion to phytates.

The seemingly most credible source is claiming that it contains “zero” caffeine:http://www.xocoatl.org/caffeine.htm…but there are plenty of other sources claiming it does contain “some” caffeine. The reason I ask is that I’d like to feed someone I care for chocolate but they have allergy to caffeine, in any amount. It seems that chocolate has properties that are similar to caffeine, but these properties (and chocolate itself) contain zero caffeine.Hoping someone can settle this chocolate/caffeine debate once and for all. A lot of the reputable science seems to be in disagreement.Possibly the confusion is between theobromine (Greek for ‘food of the gods’) and a caffeine which is similar in chemical composition:The slight chemical difference makes chocolate toxic only in much larger amounts than we would normally consume although some people can be sensitive to it, as are dogs and cats. Theobromine is a milder stimulant than caffeine although it may be just as addictive (Caffeine doesn’t do a thing for me, but I would just die if I didn’t have my daily tablespoon of cocoa powder mixed with two bananas). A person with a sensitivity to caffeine might want to slowly increase the amount they take, starting with a small amount. It’s possible that over time they could build up a resistance to it as their liver learns to dispose of it more quickly.Thank you. Yes, I’ve read about the theobromine in chocolate, but I’ve also read that chocolate, in addition to theobromine, also contains caffeine. Are you saying this is not the case, as far as the caffeine?Hi elsie,According to every reputable source I viewed, chocolate contains caffeine. In a quick search of the literature, I saw nothing to indicate any debate on the subject. “mrk’s chocolate site” is not a valid scientific source nor does he cite any to back up his claim.The one “source” he quite poorly cites is not even a real article from a real journal, but rather a newsletter with a broken link. Even if he did provide one valid source that showed *a lack of detection* of caffeine, faced with every other source showing detection of caffeine, a logical person would conclude that there is indeed caffeine in chocolate. His conclusion would be like someone drilling for oil somewhere in the state of Texas, not finding oil, and concluding there is no oil Texas, despite an obvious wealth of findings to the contrary.The following sources are the first I found with a quick search. I apologize if you do not have access to view them. If you have trouble viewing the entire article, you should be able to find and view at least the abstracts. You may be able to find more using a publicly available scientific literature database or google scholar.The first four are primary articles. The last one is a review and may be a more meaningful read for someone unfamiliar with analytical chemistry.Simultaneous Determination of Theobromine, (+)-Catechin, Caffeine, and (–)-Epicatechin in Standard Reference Material Baking Chocolate 2384, Cocoa, Cocoa Beans, and Cocoa Butter http://chromsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/10/892.longFlavanols and Methylxanthines in Commercially Available Dark Chocolate: A Study of the Correlation with Nonfat Cocoa Solids http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jf201398tComparative study of commercially available cocoa products in terms of their bioactive composition http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996909000696Optimized method for simultaneous determination of catechin, gallic acid, and methylxanthine compounds in chocolate using RP-HPLC http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/302/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00217-002-0565-3.pdf?auth66=1404410654_b3c2b9f4d4294b8445237337f2130e75&ext=.pdfPolyphenols in Cocoa and Cocoa Products: Is There a Link between Antioxidant Properties and Health? http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/13/9/2190Hey, thank you so very much. Yes, you are indeed right. Chocolate has caffeine. It is unfortunate someone is misguiding people online about this, but so it goes.But it’s a very small amount. A tablespoon of cocoa probably has the same caffeine content as one cup of decaffeinated coffee.Coffee, does indeed contain a small amount of caffeine ( 1oz=12 mg) (1cup coffee=300mg). As you see this is a very small amount, however still contributes to the improved moods and sense of well being after consuming a chocolate from a quality dark chocolate. Dark chocolate comes from the fruit of the cacao tree pods and contains a number of phytonutrients (polyphenols, flavanoids, and catechines, all powerful antioxidants shown to improve blood pressure, decrease risk of cardiovascular disease, and improve mood. Not all chocolate is equal; milk chocolate doesn’t contain these antioxidants because the milk reduces the antioxidant content. Eat small portions (1.5-3.0 ounces) in moderation, and stick with 70 % dark varieties.Cameron SeguraIt is sad…As we previously learned, Dr. Greger seems comfortable citing work supported by corporations provided that the message aligns with his own.That’s why it is surprising that he does not mention that the “Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics” strongly supports vegetarian and vegan diets.Isn’t it also the case that nutritionfacts.org itself was financially supported by an animal rights organization known as the Humane Society of the United States?The AND “support” of “well-planned” vegetarian diets makes them sound eerily dangerous . . . carefully avoiding dissing any animal products“well-planned” is a necessary qualifier for vegetarian diets to be healthful…i.e. it is necessary to eat healthful food and not vegetarian junk to gain the described health benefits. notwithstanding this important qualifier, their position statement is a well-written and unmitigated endorsement for vegetarian diets.In the other hand, omnivorous diets would be unhealthful no matter how well “planned” :DSo? It’s no more necessary for vegetarian/vegan diets to be “well planned” than for any other diet. It is a subtle form of scaremongering.I’m not sure if your sponsorship claim is true, however, even if it were, there’s a big difference between being sponsored by a non-for-profit and a large shareholder governed profit seeking corporation. It’s the difference between Superman and Lex Luthor really…not really… any conflict of interest can be an obstruction to scientific information reaching the public in an unbiased fashion…i am pointing out a double standard here.The initial (and perhaps continuing) grant to start nutritionfacts.org came from the Jesse and Julie Rasch Foundation in Toronto.The Jesse and Julie Rasch Foundation also funds four animal welfare organizations. While this is only an indirect affiliation with nutritionfacts.org, it does raise the question as to whether the foundation is swayed by Dr. Greger’s support for vegan diets, which could represent a conflict of interests.I’m sure Dr. Greger has an obvious bias for animal-free, cruelty-free vegan diets. I don’t think there’s any attempt to hide that fact, or his affiliations, or that they’re even an issue. That said, Michael presents scientific evidence that strongly supports his dietary preferences.This website presents an open forum for anyone to present their views and the science to back them up, whether they agree with Dr. Greger’s views or not. The whole world is welcomed here to present a contrary point of view.There is no shortage of scientific evidence to support the health and ethical benefits of vegan diets. But that is not the issue we are discussing here!We don’t need more arguments for veganism, we need action!! – attitude changes by the general public.While I am on record many places of this website praising Dr. Greger for being a mine of useful information for vegetarians/vegans, I am afraid that is all he is doing! I had hoped he would reach a broader audience.Outside of our community, I think Dr. Greger is perceived as being something like a religious zealot as this article puts it. We need to think harder about how the general public perceives vegetarian diets in order to change minds.The whole point of my original post was that the ADA provides a view of vegetarian/vegan diets that are strongly supportive and will reach the general public more successfully than Dr. Greger (an MD working for the Humane Society).Assuming that Dr. Greger’s goal is to change minds, by putting down the ADA, Dr. Greger is, in effect, shooting himself in the foot.Why don’t you people get that!It’s discrimination to suggest Dr. Greger’s personal beliefs and favourite charities is a conflict of interest. No one would ever say the precise opposite: that other doctors have a vested interest in promoting meat because they DON’T want to care about animal welfare, environmental damage or world hunger. If a meat eating doctor openly supported, say, the Countryside Alliance (a charity that promotes hunting in the UK), no one would question it. It would be considered irrelevant to the fact that they were a doctor who supports eating meat. It is directly analogous to what Dr. Greger did.We need to stop discrimination and double standards against vegans, not try to live within the limits and hypocrisy inflicted upon us. THAT is how we’ll finally make progress.Using your Countryside Alliance analogy, I would rephrase your analogy in a slightly more accurate form as follows:1- a person runs a nutrition website claiming that the balance of scientific evidence supports that meat is essential for good health;2- that person argues video after video that meat is beneficial while ignoring any counterarguments;3- that person just happens to work for the Countryside Alliance (i.e. pro-hunting charity) and donates the majority of proceeds from her/his work to that pro-hunting organization;4- a major dietetic organization claims that well-planned diets high in meat provide many health benefits, but also provides adverts for the health benefits for a vegan meals;5- the person with the website tries to discredit the dietetic organization for suggesting that there could be any health benefits to those vegan meals on the basis that the dietetic organization had a financial relationship with vegetable manufacturers;6- one of the followers and supporters of that person with the website comments on the website that there is the optics of a double standard;7- the most ardent and zealous supporters of the person with the website hysterically try to defend that their leader could not be flawed in anyway.VegAtHeart: To my knowledge, NutritionFacts.org has had no sponsorship from the Humane Society of the United States or any other organization beyond the original grant from the Foundation Mike listed in his post.Here’s where I think the confusion may have come in: Originally Dr. Greger donated proceeds from his videos to the Humane Society (and maybe other charities too, I don’t know).However, now all proceeds from the videos are used exclusively to support this site/NutritionFacts. So, even that link of donating money to the Humane Society has been severed.I could be wrong, but that’s my understanding.maybe… all I have seen is his disclosure that he works for them (serving as director of Public health and animal agriculture) and donates proceeds from his videos to them.What I recommend is that Dr. Greger provide appropriate disclosure statements for all authors/organizations cited in his videos so that the viewer can be informed and make up their own mind. This is better than attacking people just because they are supported by someone.The weight of evidence in favor of WFPB diet is overwhelming; the fact that Dr Greger has a position in the HS doesn’t change it. Also other doctors without any ties to animal organizations reached the same conclusions. And au contraire of what Dr Greger denounces in this video, they aren’t affiliated to any industries, including there, pharmaceuticals and food ones. In fact, very much the opposite they risked being marginalized (and they were) by making public where the data leads. Dr Greger could be making *loads* of money as physicians do in US, just by working as one of them. Instead he put his time and money to make public what no one had nothing to gain in making public.BTW, nothing to comment about the real conflict of interest presented in the video…?Leave it be…we are all fighting big agro-corporations for the simple fact they are the leading causes of global depletion…regardless of where funding goes or comes from for this informative and science-based website, that is the least of our quarrels. We stand united to choose vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and fruits for health of our planet and our own health.You made some points…First of all, Registered Dietitian is spelled with a “t” and not a “c” and this message, while informative just gives RD’s a really horrible reputation. Sorry we aren’t medical doctors but regardless of where our funding comes from, not all Registered Dietitians in the profession associate heavily with this organization and we still know more about nutrition than any MD (we spend 4 years in nutrition rather than taking just one class and also are BOARD CERTIFIED). The corporate sponsorship doesn’t help our reputations any, but not all RD’s utilize the information on the website for AND as mentioned in the video as we have the skills and training necessary to facilitate patient care without these resources. To say that the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) is “our group” is incorrect and highly ignorant. Remember this: nutritionists are not Registered Dietitians, but all Registered Dietitians are nutritionists; in order to be a Registered Dietitian, one does not have to be a member or affiliate with AND, it is a separate entity and therefore should be considered when assuming that AND is “our group.”Just out of curiosity have you looked into the test or requirements for Nutritionist? First they must hold a doctorate of some kind. MD, DPT, etc. They must have all the science courses one would expect that would be required for these science based degrees. And–the test itself isn’t easy. I have compared the dietician programs and they just don’t compare. Maybe I am missing something.But either way you all should get together and stop the above conflicts of your organizations. It’s just bad business.This depends on whether or not you live in a state where the title “nutritionist” is licensed or protected. In my state, anyone can call themselves a nutritionist without any credentials/training.And I would hope everyone would do their homework before signing up with a “nutritionist.”No this is completely untrue. Nutritionist is an unlicensed title in majority of the states. It often takes little more than an online test to use this title. The RDN has and continues to be the Gold standard for nutritional credentials. No, we’re not all affiliated with Coca Cola. We’re a group of thousands of different vegans, meat eaters, etc.Well I am not sure about all that. One can get a graduate degree in nutrition and not be a RD right? There seems to be some misunderstanding in the general public.While there are many very capable RDs, the gold standard for clinical nutrition is the Certified Nutrition Specialist, which requires an advanced degree and far more rigorous and relevant examination and experience. Many RDs go on to become a CNS once they have completed an advanced degree and the type of advanced clinical nutrition training the RD credential alone does not require.In my State, you can have a Bachelor’s degree in Nutrition, complete a one-year unpaid internship and then sit for the test to become a licensed RD. However, I was told by the school I am planning to attend that in the next few years, there will be a push to only allow RD certification with the same requirements but requiring a Master’s degree.That being said, I’m not aware of a separate nutritionist certification at the doctorate level. Something I would be interested in though!This looks pretty serious to me but I am not in this field. http://cbns.orgBut either way I would like to point out that Dr Greger bags on his profession too!The CNS certification was designed for clinicians and scientists without a bachelor’s degree in nutrition/dietetics who want to conduct nutrition work. The coursework and hours of supervised practice (1200 for RD) are equivalent to requirements for the dietetic internship, with the exception of the graduate degree (which will soon be a requirement for RD’s as well). I know very few individuals with both the RD and CNS certification, mostly b/c you are reinventing the wheel by having both. Both groups respect the other, and in the research setting we very much appreciate the wide variety of backgrounds that come from having both RDs and CNS involved.Much of that 4 years of training is NOT in nutrition per se. It is in general education requirements, the science of food systems, food service sanitation, food production and service etc. Yes you get the basic sciences such as A&P, organic chemistry, biochemistry etc. and you do get basic nutrition courses, Medical nutrition therapy etc. but so do other nutrition majors, and many of those programs get much more actual clinical type nutrition courses.The Registered Dietician degree started out as home economics and frankly a lot of it has not changed enough to keep up with nutrition science. Sadly The RD program that Cade accredits appears to keep on earning the bad reputation it is getting with the public. And to my understanding (I could be wrong) these programs have to follow USDA guidelines, and we all know the industries by which this department is controlled.This is not to say that any individual dietitian is not up to par in the nutritional sciences. There are some top notch ones out there, but they seem to be motivated to go beyond their formal education. However the formal education requirements of the RD training programs need to drastically change, and the AAND does indeed need to dump those corporate sponsors!I think it is important to point out that not all Registered Dietitian’s agree with the AND’s philosophy and junk food/beverage corporate sponsors.As mentioned by others, not all RDs are affiliated with AND as we do not agree or use the all the information provided by this organization. Some of us are part of the group called Dietitians for Professional Integrity who is working on getting sponsorship for AND that are free from conflict of interest. They also provide resources to obtain CEUs free from conflict of interest. You should research the group before implying that AND is the group for RDs. In addition, AND is not the only organization that is sponsored by big food industry; some physician organizations are also being accepting sponsorship from these companies.Wow, I love what you are doing! Continuing Education hours free from commercial interest, especially if made affordable, will do the professional a lot of good.I’m new to this, and still “learning how to eat”, but it seems to me I don’t have to worry about corporate brand names if I’m buying the right stuff. There are no brand names on watermelon, carrots, and fresh leafy greens. In fact, since starting to change my eating habits I have not had occasion to leave the supermarket with anything branded, bottled, boxed, or canned by any corporation. As long as we shop outside the corporate circle of influence we can safely ignore all the “good advice” of corporate-owned scientists.You mean coke is food? Wait, what?Our daughter is a newly minted RD who is well aware of these relationships with the AND. She and many of her colleagues do not allow this “embarrassing list of sponsors” to influence their practice.Nearly all corporations follow the money, except a few such as this fantastic website, PCRM, Dr. McDougall, The Medical letter.The only way I see this changing is when the money sources change and/or the public demands it!Until then, it will be, “The Same Bat Time, Same Bat Channel.”“Holy conflicts of interest Batman!”http://www.AmericanCollegeofNutrition.org takes no corporate funding of any kind, and is a pre-eminent nutrition science professional society.I was a big fan of this site..until this video. While it’s important to bring awareness to this issue in hopes of pressuring AND to change their policy, it is inaccurate to paint all dietitians with the same brush. Many dietitians are embarrassed by AND and Dietitian of Canada’s corporate ties, and are fighting to have policy changed. Also, not all RD’s are members of these groups.Where would you have the public go for accurate, evidence-based nutrition advice? “Nutritionist” is an unprotected title in many areas, and a large number of MD’s are fairly illiterate in nutrition. RD’s remain the experts.I am glad to hear that many dieticians try to remain neutral, yet they are under an organization with an agenda which cannot go against their sponsors. The book Whole by Collin Campbell explains the problem in detail.Otherwise they wouldn’t go around with the “no bad foods and beverages” discourse.Most of my RD colleagues NEVER bought into the ADA slogans of “all foods can fit.” Re: “no bad foods”‘ – I’d reply, that until foods can “act or behave” there are no “bad” or good foods. There may be unhealthy and health foods, and frankly, there ARE many foods that are 100% unhealthy and shouldn’t be eaten. Just think about it, “no bad foods”? How stupid is that? If somebody has an allergy, even a trace of a food may kill. So, ANY food can be a killer, to the right person.I agree with you that not all dietitians should be painted with the same brush. However, I really appreciate knowing more about the conflicts of interest of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics; this was a much needed issue that more of us need to be aware of. It’s definitely a huge problem for the credibility of the profession. Dr. Greger should probably have clarified that there are many great dietitians out there, although there are many more who probably redistribute or regurgitate what industry has provided to the Academy.Thanks for pointing out that not all RDs share the policies of AND and yes, many of us are embarrassed by their corporate ties, and sadly lots of RDs aren’t fully aware of them. It’s not a requirement to be a member of AND to practice, and lots of RDs cut ties with AND because of their corporate ties. It’s hard work to become an RD, and really frustrating to have to defend our credibility when most of us try daily to have a positive impact on people’s lives .Well, the AND gets exposed. This has been going on for years. I saw it happening as a now retired RD. It’s embarrassing to see a former president of the then ADA in the movie Forks over Knives supporting the corporations views she was working for. All a bunch of misinformation! How could that be? Money, it’s all about money. I see in print above that Dr Greger points out 2 of his favorite evidence based Dietitians. It would have been nice to mention something a little more supportive of RD’s in the video. I never met or worked with a Dietitian who intended to harm or give false information to anyone. We just wanted to help patients get well & stay well.“When you hear the title Registered Dietitian, this is the group they’re registered with.”This is misleading and not accurate.For one, not all RD’s are on the same page with Academy when it comes to dietary approaches. Also, not all RD’s are members of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. In fact, there are thousands of RD’s who are not affiliated, or active paying members, with the AND because of the concerns you raise in this video. All RD’s are registered with the Commission on Dietetic Registration, the credentialing agency of the AND, but are not required to be active members of the Academy.There is a group of highly proactive RD’s seeking to change the corporate sponsorships with the AND. They have a website: http://integritydietitians.org and a Facebook page: Dietitians for Professional Integrity.There are many RD’s who promote and advocate for plant-centered diets, and avoidance of highly refined and processed foods, and animal products. How come you make no mention of these individuals?And to be fair, there are very few doctors, less in number than that of RD’s I would bet, who are advocates of plant-centered diets.Do you have any ideas for what a RD who does not support AND’s corporate sponsorship should do?Applause, applause, applause! And, thank you so very much for this report that documents why RDs apparently should not be trusted as possessing correct nutrition information, something I realized in the 1970s and decided to become a natural nutritionist rather than a Registered Dietician, which back then labeled me a ‘quack’. What I learned back then, RDs are just starting to incorporate into some of their work. There’s a tremendous difference in nutrition values, information, and how the body uses food when information does not come from corporations that make the products and provide financial subsidies to those entrusted with dispensing supposedly accurate information, as you so eloquently point out, AND which is part of the problem with many of the food-related health problems we ‘enjoy’ today due to food processors ideas of nutrition. Supporting RDs in many ways allows food processors the ‘earned’ rights to provide ‘nutrition’ information, in my opinion and, obviously, yours. The sad part about the RD agenda is that professionally as a group they are legally recognized as knowing what nutrition is all about. In my opinion, that seems to be quite a stretch. Why aren’t RDs coming down hard on the inferior values of GMO foods, especially the inordinate amounts of pesticides GMO crops are sprayed with in the growing fields or those crops that grow their own pesticides that humans and animals raised as food are forced to eat? Thank you, again, for shining the spotlight of fact on an issue of immense nutritional importance to USA citizens. I hope they and the RDs will take seriously what you’ve said in this report.Well, many RD’s ARE indeed concerned about Monsanto, pesticides, etc.Many RDs ARE coming down hard on GMO foods. There’s an entire AND subunit called “Hunger and Environmental Nutritionists” – most of the opposed to GMOs. (Maybe not the ones working in 3rd world countries with malnutrition and thinking maybe gmo corn might prevent blindness to millions. It’s a tough call for some in those situations – not something most of us are exposed to in our land of abundance.)video not playing. Issue?My own interest in nutrition, particularly with plant-based diets, prompted me to pursue a formal nutrition science education – and I’m glad I went this route – each course provides more critical context in the complex canvas of food and physiology that I could never have learned efficiently on my own – and I’ve only just scratched the surface. I’ll need to make a decision in the coming months as to whether I’ll pursue a Master’s with an RD certification or track a research path. I’m glad to read some of the comments from RD’s clarifying that affiliation with AND is a choice and that there’s an effort to put an end to the conflict of interest. Nevertheless, since AND manages RD credentialing, these funding relationships degrade the integrity of the organization overall.Great area of study you are interested in. Have you checked out the graduate programs in nutrition? They look so interesting.Yes indeed. There are two Universities in my area with graduate programs in Nutrition. The one I plan to enter has two tracks – one leads to RD certification, the other more research focused. The RD path seems to be a prudent choice from an job standpoint as most healthcare organizations only hire RD’s. That being said, I’m not sure which path is for me yet.Dr. Greger, you have nicely identified the root cause of many systemic cycles. Financial influence in our decision making process corrupts the outcome and put into question the “common knowledge” of our society in many industries: food, medical, transportation, waste management, etc. Where money is involved, and weak and poorly understood policies in place, this is the results. Perfect results given the conditions we have allowed to be created over time…Registered Dietitian here – and I can say for myself and thousands of other RDs. This video and some of the conflicts of interests of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics DOES NOT REFLECT the opinion and practice of many RDs.We are highly against this and have been fighting a huge battle within the organization to stop all questionable sponsorship and end all conflicts of interests.So be encouraged. Many RDs agree and will continue to give quality scientific based nutrition counseling, regardless of the the sponsorship of the Academy.And not all registered dietitians agree with the policies and sponsorships of the ANDHow about the hypocrisy of WIC (Women, Infants & Children)? They will not allow a bag of potatoes on their produce voucher (maybe $3), but you can get TWO 64oz juices per juice voucher. The number of vouchers vary with each person. When I had WIC 20+yrs ago, I could get can tuna and an extra lb of carrots for being a breastfeeding mom. The cereal choices have gone downhill too. It’s relegated to cheap “crisp rice” and other cheap filler cereal. I know, I’m am alternate on my daughter-in-law’s WIC. Going to the store to get WIC is not fun.Why would they have juice in favor or eating fruit? What is “cheap filler cereal”? Why would somebody even buy “crisp rice” when it is cheaper to buy dry rice and cook it? Dry oats too for that matter.If you are receiving WIC, you have to get what is on the voucher. If you’ve never heard of WIC, you won’t know what I’m talking about. “Crisp rice” is generic Rice Crispies. That’s what WIC allows you to get with their vouchers.I am not a woman, infant or child. But… are you saying that WIC forces a consumption of sugar water with artificial color and flavor on you? If so, it is nutritionally criminal. Almost free water from the tap would be a better choice. What are the best things that WIC provides (in your opinion)?jamfhall1: I don’t know much of anything about the WIC program. But I did just read a brief article in the Vegetarian Journal put out by VRG (Vegetarian Resource Group) about some positive changes. Some quotes of interest: ” One important change for vegans and others avoiding dairy products isthat medical documentation is no longer needed for program participantsto get vouchers for soy beverages and calcium-set tofu in place of cow’smilk – See more at: http://www.vrg.org/blog/2014/03/05/revisions-to-the-wic-food-package-make-sense/#sthash.HjD03TqA.dpufOne important change for vegans and others avoiding dairy products is that medical documentation is no longer needed for program participants to get vouchers for soy beverages and calcium-set tofu in place of cow’s milk.”That’s the good news. The bad news is: “… not all states allow soy milk or tofu to replace cow’s milk but for those that do, it will be easier for this substitution to take place. As of 2011, 71% of state agencies allow soy milk to replace cow’s milk and 40% allow tofu to replace cow’s milk.”VRG kindly posted the article for free on their website if you want to read more: http://www.vrg.org/blog/2014/03/05/revisions-to-the-wic-food-package-make-sense/This article/content doesn’t really address your issue. But I see the information as a sign of hope and thought you might want to know about it if you didn’t already know.Good luck to you and your daughter-in-law.Dr. Greger, I am very very disappointed in your myopic commentary regarding the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) and their relationship with the corporate food industry. As a registered dietitian working with cancer patients, it is a daily challenge to help provide nutrition recommendations to people who are often unable to eat a mainly plant-based whole foods diet. While I agree, as do many of my colleagues, that the poor quality foods which are heavily marketed to American consumers are far from ideal, we as nutrition professionals are frustrated by the lack inexpensive, good quality foods. The amount of money that the AND receives from the food industry is fairly insignificant in terms of the AND’s overall budget, but the work that thousands of registered dietitians are doing in under-served communities, with children and families, with the elderly, with immigrants in helping improve health is worth billions of dollars in terms of health care savings. You have inappropriately maligned a group of nutrition professionals who practice nutrition with high standards of training and ethics. Over the past year, I’ve been so pleased with many of your comments and discussions pertaining to nutrition research and feel very sad that I can no longer respect your opinions.audrey: I can’t comment on the majority of your post. I’m sure there are lots of AND people trying to do their best. But that doesn’t make Dr. Greger’s message a problem. I don’t see this video maligning a group so much as pointing out a serious problem that if addressed, would make the group much stronger. This airing of the problem is a good thing.There is one small point I particularly wanted to address: “we as nutrition professionals are frustrated by the lack inexpensive, good quality foods.” From what I can tell, the most healthy foods are very inexpensive and easy to attain. For example: Dried beans. Potatoes. Rice. You might consider checking out this article: http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/26/best-nutrition-bang-for-your-buck/And there are a couple of cookbooks that may interest you, including this well-researched one:Vegan on $4 A DayFrom Amazon: “Not only can a plant-based diet be good for health, it can also be easy on the pocketbook. At a time when many people are looking for a way to cut costs, Vegan on $4 a Day will show readers how to forgo expensive processed foods and get the most flavor out of delicious, high-quality basic ingredients. Author Ellen Jaffe Jones has combined passion, money savvy, journalistic expertise, and culinary skills into a consumer’s guide for an economically viable dietary lifestyle. She has scoured the shelves of popular supermarkets and big-box stores and calculated exactly how much it costs to eat healthfully and deliciously. Readers will learn how to adapt their favorite recipes, cook with beans and grains, and use bulk buying to get big savings. Includes nearly 100 nutritious, delicious and low cost recipes and a week’s worth of menu- planning ideas that show how the recipes can be combined to get a cost of $4 a day.”I guess I just don’t see the problem/the lack with the food that is available.That said, I find I never agree or disagree 100% with anyone, including Dr. Greger. But even though I have disagreed with Dr. Greger on a topic or two in the past, I put situation into perspective. I didn’t think, “hhmmm. Now I can’t trust/don’t respect anything he says.” I understand that I can’t agree with everything he says. We aren’t twins. I’m not out to defend Dr. Greger in this case. What does interest me is your reaction an where society in general seems to be going when it comes to disagreements. I don’t think we have been going in a healthy direction. Something to think about.Your snide and disparaging comments about dietitians reflects a lack of insight into what we do and how many of us are just as passionate as you about promoting healthy nutrition. Rather than waste time countering your very broad brush stroke condemnation of dietitians, I am simply deleting your site from my Favorites list. Too bad, because dietitians have been among your biggest supporters.Dietician commenters have reacted to this video with intense butthurt. He is perfectly entitled to talk about corporate interests. If it weren’t for the very last sentence, all your ego’s would have come out unscathed. Maybe he should have worded it better, but it is clear from the rest of the article that he is criticising the organisations, not its members, and the fact that the groups towing the official line are financially supported by questionable profit driven companies. The last sentence was intended to let viewers know why some dieticians promote unhealthy foods or are judgmental towards vegans.This excerpt in particular: “Is this what family doctors have been reduced to? To justify an unholy financial alliance we hide behind what others say and do and deny that there are actually unhealthy “bad” foods?” – especially the use of the word “we” when referring to fellow health professionals – should have made it very clear that he was not attacking dieticians themselves.It could be said that RDs have a subconscious vested interest in not having their credibility questioned.All RD’s are not the same. I was unlucky enough to get one who was concerned that I ate no animal products. And she was VERY concerned that my fat intake was less than 10%. (Less than 10% was the figure which proved successful in reversing heart disease ala Esselstyn and Ornish)I’m in school to become a registered dietitian but I hereby do solemnly swear, I will never claim there are no good or bad foods and I will never say “everything in moderation.”LearningFromThePast: You rock! Sounds like you will be a force for good when you launch your career. Good luck!How can one find out, that ADA is sponsored by these organisations? Is it written on their homepage? Where am I heading is – can we find out, whether the europian organisations are also sponsored?Great video and as an RD I share the concerns of AND’s position regarding ‘no bad foods’. Just to clarify: AND does not register Dietitians, that is a separate organization, Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR). An RD can be registered in the national registry and not hold an AND membership. They are separate. I have been an RD for 25 years and most of that without ADA or AND membership because they do not well represent the vast majority of RDs. Coca Cola, NutraSweet, the MSG Council (who knew), even the Corn Syrup Association is always in attendance at the annual convention. The convention floor is clearly well funded by Coca Cola, Heinz, ConAgra etc. Very disheartening.Linda: It’s a good post. I appreciated you making the distinction between being registered and being a member of ADA and/or AND. As a lay person, I had not understood that distinction before.Thanks for being one of the good ones!Dr. Greger, after watching Forks Over Knives and reading Discovering the Word of Wisdom and The China Study, I have changed to a WFPB diet. I love it and truly feel that it is something that can have a huge impact in preventing and reversing disease and help promote overall health. I began applying for physical therapy programs for next year before making this change and I am now wondering if this is the right route to go. I want to be able to help people and incorporate this knowledge in my profession but I don’t really know what opportunities are out there that will allow me to really make an impact while still earning enough to provide for my family and work a standard 40 hour work week.

That’s a little confusing. Why didn’t they just label the category as “vegans?”“Vegan” also has ethical connotations, wherein practitioners also avoid everything from leather clothing to patronizing circuses. “Strict vegetarian”, an older phrase, avoids the non-dietary associations, as many chose plant based diets for heath concerns, and it has been the term favored in author Gary Fraser’s Adventist studies since 1981.Thank you!That clears up a lot of issues I have read about over the last couple of years. I wish I had looked up these various definitions earlier! :)Actually, Darryl, “plant based” could include a small daily animal portion. I have heard even Dr Campbell (The China Study) declare in a debate that he ate a small amount of fish, so he was emphatically NOT a vegan. Plant-based seems to infer the diet is mostly plants. A clear animal content cutoff is not clear in this terminology. This vagueness is precisely why I do not prefer or use the term.I’ve heard Dr. Campbell lecture on several occasions, as recently as March 2014, and I’ve never heard him say he ate fish. (Perhaps he was talking about Bill Clinton.) Reference this NY Times article Q&A: http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/nutrition-advice-from-the-china-study/comment-page-17/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0 Q. Do you advocate a 100 percent plant-based diet? A.We eat that way, meaning my family, our five grown children and five grandchildren. We all eat this way now.Mike, Nope he was talking about his own diet. It occurred during a debate with a Paleo advocate named Westman at UAB in 2013. Check out the video of this at –http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJYlXmfb08MCheck out the time 1:12:27 or thereabouts, where he discusses eating fish in his family.I remember being shocked when I heard this, given the arguments he puts forth, the poisons found in all fish, and the imminent collapse of the ocean systems. But, maybe this is what happens when the only discussion is about health. Once you allow animal protein into your diet, the question immediately becomes how much. To quote Walter Willet, MD, the head of Harvard’s Department of Nutrition, “There are no nutrients in animal foods that cannot be gotten better from plants.” So, why should an animal suffer or die for your eating pleasure? Thus we find that the way to answer the how much question is with ethics. That is, anything more than none is too much.Quote from 1:12:27ish: “I tend not to eat fish. Maybe occassionally”. This could be interpreted in two ways, I think. Either an admission that he himself eats fish occassionally. Or an attempt to say “I myself do not eat fish. But maybe it is from a health perspective acceptable (at least not yet proven harmful) to eat fish occassionally.” in line with what John Mooter writes below.That vagueness is precisely why I like the term plant-based. All the populations in the Blue Zones eat plant-based diets which include some animal foods.Agreed, eating small amounts of animal based foods has never been proven to be harmful and may make a plant-based diet “whole”. In that one would not need to take supplements. How’s that for blasphemy!Campbell does not eat any animal foods. I met him a few years back. What he says it that it has not been proven that a small amount of animal foods cause harm, for example, 1 or 2 percent of calories. Read his new book, “Whole”.Both Dr Campbell and Dr. McDougall eat a little meat/fish every couple of years just to avoid being labeled vegan, in the case of McDougall he has some turkey every other year on thanksgiving. They prefer Whole food plant based.Ah, yes….the protein question. I wish I had a dollar for every time someone has asked me “how do you get enough protein?” Now, I can come back with, “how much fiber do you eat?”I agree with you, I too get this question much too often. I still do not understand what the emphasis on protein is in this society. Protein deficiency does not exist without calorie deficiency, which would inherently come with micronutrient deficiency. The constant reminder in advertisement displaying X grams of protein per serving doesn’t help either. My mother goes to a Lifetime fitness gym and she saw a personal trainer. Even they pushed for her to start including protein powders in her diet, and she is not even plant based. Thankfully she ignored this advice. There is not one good reason based on the science to push for more protein in the American diet, the opposite is true. There needs to be a public health message to reduce overall protein intake, not continue to increase it.Yes, I remember reading Adele Davis when I first became interested in nutrition and she advised high protein and dairy intake. Interesting that she died of cancer. She was my start at getting away from processed foods and learning about nutrients. Thank goodness, I later found the books of Nathan Pritikin, Dr. Neal Barnard and Dr. McDougall.I think it’s caused by the same flawed logic that makes people think that diabetes is caused by eating sugar.“Meat contains shiploads of protein, so if you want to gain muscle you have to eat muscle.”So why are gorillas and elephants so strong and big?They spend the majority of their time consuming relatively, calorically poor food sources. It would require a similar shift in quantity for us. Also, they possess the appropriate enzyme cocktails and digestive tracks for optimal extraction. Our digestive tracts are not as efficient. The amino acids obtained from plants are not in the correct ratio for human needs. Therefore we would be required to eat more plant protein to meet our requirements.You really didn’t read what I said and reply with some unscientific claims.The meat and dairy and egg industry’s all have way to much money for lobbying and instead of calling it meat they use the word protein to get people to eat it, like it is the only place it is in! That infuriates me! The other industries like vegetables and grans and fruits and lagoons do not get government subsidies like the meat and dairy and egg industries do.So true, “protein” is used interchangeably with meat. This needs to change.And then one step even further by calling the animals. Making the connection that people are eating an animal helps them see beyond their plate to the reality.Yeah and I also get people telling me that my diet is dangerous. When I press them for why they say because they heard you don’t get all your vitamins. When I ask which ones they say, “I don’t know, but you don’t”. So I tell them about B12 and site my blood level of B12. Then I ask if they know their level. Of course they don’t. If they are kind of nasty about it I also ask if they eat a brazil nut every day for selenium. Of course they think that’s…. nuts. [sorry, been listening to Dr. Greger too long. ;-) ]hahhaha I didn’t know that was in a greger video, I too eat a brazil nut everyday (or every other day) for selenium!And to make it even more funny, many of the cadaver-eaters are probably low in B12, because of all the proton pump inhibitors they have to take, because of their heartburn, and PPI can cause malabsorption af B12.There is a nice video on this website on the matter: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegan-epidemic/I think it is great how you answer them. I had one person say that she know that we were to be eating meat just because she has lived on a farm her whole life. I just said to her have you studied how are body’s are made to work with the food we eat. That ended that. I have found that some people no mater what information you give them don’t want to change there core believes as it would mean that they were responsible for there health.Forget protein, how on Earth are people supposed to get 4.5 grams of potassium daily?another one of Dr. Greger’s videos http://nutritionfacts.org/video/98-of-american-diets-potassium-deficient/The average target of 42g daily is interesting to me. The last time I researched it on the web the consensus of my requirement was bit higher than that, differing slightly by source, but was generally around 1 to 1.5g per kg, depending upon activity. That put my lanky butt at around twice the 42g daily target. This lower target you comforts me somewhat, because trying to eat that much protein is sometimes a challenge, especially on days when I do just fine on a couple of light vegan meals and a fruit smoothie or two. I had dismissed that high target as probably wrongly influenced by the traditional SAD, but was always a little doubtful about being right in doing so.I believe you need 0.8 g/day, but 1g is a good buffer. Most athletes, excepting body builders, don’t even need 1.5g/day of protein. (There are some great videos out on vegan athletes with a dietitian).Dr. Greger, just to clarify, is your recommendation for November 13, 2012 to get 0.5mg/lb of protein still accurate? In that case, obviously, an intake of 42mg/day would be deficient for almost everyone. The good news appears that many of the vegetarian and vegan participants in this study would still be getting adequate protein, of around 60-80mg/day depending on ideal body weight. But some were probably not.Grams, not milligrams for sure. The numbers I am familiar with is that the body needs 0.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, though many recommend 0.8 grams to add a fudge factor. Given the findings on this video, a fudge factor does not seem to be needed.You’re right of course about grams, thanks. I encourage you to look at this video.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-protein-recommendations/I do remember that video and your question to Dr. Greger is warranted. Plus I stand corrected, a bit, for not noting that the denominator should be IDEAL body weight.I was about to ask the same question. It’s still confusing. 42 g/day vs 90 g/day is a big difference.The ratio is PER KILOGRAM of body weight, so if you need 0.6g/kg, a 150 pound person would need nearly 41 grams of protein per day.According to this video: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-protein-recommendations/ the ideal protein intakes is 1 to 1.2 g/kg. My lean weight is 70-75 kg. So, if I take 75 kg, that makes 75 times 1.2 = 90 grams of protein per day. Today, I had about 65-70 grams, way short of 90.From this very interesting paper:Overall, our human and animal studies indicate that a low protein diet during middle age is likely to be beneficial for the prevention of cancer, overall mortality, and possibly diabetes through a process that may involve, at least in part, regulation of circulating IGF-1 and possibly insulin levels. In agreement with other epidemiological and animal studies, our findings suggest that a diet in which plant-based nutrients represent the majority of the food intake is likely to maximize health benefits in all age groups. However, we propose that up to age 65 and possibly 70, depending on health status, the 0.7 to 0.8 g of proteins/kg of body weight/day reported by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, currently viewed as a minimum requirement, should be recommended instead of the 1.0–1.3 g grams of proteins/kg of body weight/day consumed by adults ages 19–70. We also propose that at older ages, it may be important to avoid low protein intake and gradually adopt a moderate to high protein, preferably mostly plant-based consumption to allow the maintenance of a healthy weight and protection from frailty.“We also propose that at older ages, it may be important to avoid low protein intake and gradually adopt a moderate to high protein”Important to note that their interpretation of “low protein” is 4% of calories from protein, and that a “moderate to high” protein diet is “at least 10% of the calories consumed” from protein, which would still be quite low relative to what most people on the SAD consume.On a wfpb diet myself, I’m usually at about what they consider “high protein” (18%). When it first came out, this paper made me consider lowering my protein consumption. The funny thing is, it would be kind of difficult, as I don’t make any special effort to consume as much protein as I do.Their low protein category is 20%. I really wish they had chosen more informative category bins as somewhere under 1% of the American population would be considered “low protein” and about 5% “high”, according to this data, more or less confirmed by this more recent survey.Likewise, I make no special effort to consume protein, and when I play on Cron-o-meter my diet ranges between 11-13% protein, and I’d have to eat significant added oils or junk-food to get below 10%. I don’t know how those in the low-protein category in the study are managing it, but its difficult eating just whole plant foods.Even though I was a vegetarian for 20 years I’m no longer convinced this is the right way to eat. My first husband was a vegetarian who ate eggs and very little dairy. He ate no sugar, was extremely thin, and was also a runner. So imagine our shock when he was diagnosed with a serious heart problem. He needed a replacement valve. His surgeon said he aorta was so thin it was ready to burst. He survived this major operation but died within a year because he never recuperated properly. He literally wasted away. He could not build any muscle mass. Looking back I realize he did not utilize vegetable protein well. He always had digestive upset from legumes. The heart is a muscle. I believe he did not get enough protein from his diet to keep his heart healthy or to recover from a major operation. Since his passing I changed my diet to include meat.Deane, I’m sorry to hear about your loss and your husband’s passing, especially since he was clearly working to keep in good health. But I don’t think that what might have been a specific condition for him is necessarily a general rule for the entire population. I react to sesame and turmeric and can’t eat either But that doesn’t make them bad for most people. My health and test results all improved when I went off animal products. Twenty-five years on I’m glad I made the change. Otherwise I’d be like my father brothers, heart attacks at early ages. As an omnivore, my cholesterol was 218 with LDL higher than HDL, as a vegan it’s 117 with HDL high than LDL.I think your thoughts are reasonable. When I listen to these videos and others and listen carefully to what is said, the vast majority if about getting enough plant-based nutrients in our bodies. Somehow this all gets crammed together, maybe for good reasons, into never eat meat, but when I parse the actual words and studies I do not see the stressing of do not eat meat as much as I see eat more plant-based, do not eat processed foods, and not really much about meat except as it relates to the vast majority of people who only eat meat, dairy, sugar and processed foods of the average factory farmed processed American diet.I tried vegetarian for about a year and I think I got something out of it, but recently I have been eating meat and also not worrying about fat, though I don’t like fat so much. I feel much better and have more energy, and just feel more confident, but that’s just me.I think one problem in America is that we are so based around money that no one can just talk about the scientific data, because no one can afford to, everyone is selling something, and to differentiate “businesses” have to have something different to sell. So you have people focusing on gluten, sugar, carbs, greens, or whatever to try to market something, otherwise we never hear from anyone.I dont think that there are suffucient data to claim that 100% WFPB diet are better than 98% WFPB diet. Little meat or dairy on occassion probably wont hurt. For many going all the way (100% WFPB) is easier.WFPB?whole food plant basedThanksYes, and if you are an ethical vegan, it is easy to eat all plants…and I feel great!Agreed, methinks that more folks would be willing to go along with this approach. The either or approach emblematic of dualistic thinking turns off folks. Veganevangelism usually doesn’t work.Meat and eggs and dairy are what are killing us! We are not made to eat any of it and are bodies are fighting back that is why so many are sick. If you educate your self and do the research you will know how to eat properly and have all the energy you need from a whole food plant based diet. You just have the belief indoctrinated in you since you were little like we all were. I have more energy then I ever had and if you were right then athletes before they do extraneous exercise would eat a hug steak but they fill up on complex carbohydrates. And elephant is the largest land animal and it has lots of energy and it is a herbivore.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNCGkprGW_oI understand what you are saying about stressing too much over “I must not have this” particular food (e.g. for me…dairy, eggs, fish). These foods were staples in my diet growing up so they are entrenched in my food history.However, in the last two years I’ve caught myself stressing over choosing an animal product because I watch the videos on here and I had some health issues (which now seem to be resolved, thankfully).I have found that since I’ve improved my wfpb diet (making sure I consume enough nutrients), I don’t get the same cravings leading me to my old stand-bys.And, in either case, I just decided to let go of that guilt / fear and just let myself have a dairy ice-cream if I want it, or an egg sandwich or a piece of fish, and now I’ve found I want those foods less and less.Hi Deane, Values are a genetic issue. My husband also went through that surgery and it kicked his butt. It turns out they think the bad value and thinning aorta go hand in hand. His grandmother had the same issue.Do you mean VALVES are a genetic issue? Bad VALVE and thinning aorta go hand in hand?I probably spoke too quickly. A bicuspid valve and a thinning aorta are often seen together. The point I wanted to make was that it is a very difficult surgery. Or were you just correcting my typos?I have a bicuspid aortic valve and a couple years ago learned that I had a considerably dilated ascending aorta, as well. But I didn’t learn that until discussion at my next exam, which included a fresh echocardiogram. In the intervening two years, or a little before, I had switched to fully WFPBD (including no added oils). That most recent echocardiogram showed the aortic dilation much improved. Instead of being ready for surgery based on degree of dilation (as I might have been if the condition had progressed at the same rate as before), the dilation was reduced to almost within normal range. I was astonished, though neither my GP nor my cardiologist seemed all that interested. I’ll get another two year test this fall.If Esselstyn’s dietary approach is all about the health of the endothelium, that approach may have paid off in greatly improved elasticity in my aorta where it emerges from the still dodgy valve.Yes, the two conditions (bicuspid or other aortic valve defect and weakening of the adjacent segment of the aorta) indeed tend to go together– but perhaps only because of a predisposition to aortic weakening (thought to be caused by hydraulic abnormalities in flow from the diseased valve); perhaps the predisposition need not be fulfilled if the artery and its lining are healthy as a result of adequate diet– just as a genetic predisposition to heart disease in general need not result in actual disease if diet is adequate. My experience is just an anecdote, a single data point. However, it is, so far, contrary to the ordinary or expected progression of aortic dilation, and so, I would have thought, interesting. I am encouraged to hope that I might not need the ambitious surgery to replace the valve and adjacent portion of the aorta– or that I might avoid it for much longer than would have been the case if I had not encountered Esselstyn, Campbell, McDougal, Greger, et al. I would like to think that other patients with valve or aortic problems could benefit from a similar appoach.Good news!My husband is a competitive cyclist so he tends to have his heart rate up into the 175 or higher range for extended periods of time. He became a bit tentative thinking he was going to blow.The newest thinking about the aortic aneurysm is that it is probably not caused by the funky way the blood is going through the valve but is just part of the genetic condition.Really interesting test results JPotter.Thank you for sharing this. Do you think daily whey protein or yogurt or maybe some fish might have made the difference? Dealing with similar issues. Thanks.As I told Deane, protein deficiency is non existent among vegetarians unless one is not getting enough calories. The addition of the suggested foods would hurt the quality of health. Reducing sodium intake and processed foods may be helpful.I’ve had viral issues heal when including lean fish, and no veggie or fruit or nut or seed, grain or bean ever made a difference. I’m vegan now, and somewhat reluctant but doing it. But when I go back to “complete” fish proteins, viral issues often get better. Have tried all sorts of plant based proteins, in all amounts and combinations. I know of vegans who simply claim to have not “healed” whatever it is they were dealing with until they added back some non-vegan proteins. Everyone might be different in this regard. For now, I’m staying vegan, but I am open to the “truth” of other’s journey in this life, and where that “truth” might direct me.Sorry for your loss Deane. Lets remember that a vegetarian diet is not necessarily healthy unless one is consuming the proper foods. Even a full vegan can consume a high sodium diet, processed foods (white flours) and free oils which would make this diet not particularly healthy. I know of no evidence suggesting those who are vegetarian do not get enough protein. As long as caloric needs are met, we will always get enough protein. The baggage that comes with meat consumption is not worth the risks. High sodium in particular has damaging effects in terms of blood vessels.lets not for get cholesterol it is only found in animal products. and every time we eat any we also urinate out calcium. there for get osteoporosis.There is so much information out there I am sorry that your husband died but it was all about the food he eat. Watch forks over knives Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn’s Heart Disease Prevention & Reversal. top in his field for curing heart disease. Food That Kills – Full Presentation http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNCGkprGW_oEating eggs is as bad as meat as far as the heart is concerned. Dr. Esselstyn has reversed heart disease with a low fat plant diet. Please read “WHole” by T. Colin Campbell, PhDI am curious as I workout frequently and am a 20 year old 180 lb male. I used to eat quite a bit more protein since I have changed my diet to almost entirely plant based. I have found that I have lost som weight, but have felt some decrease in muscle growth. Should I be eating more than 42 g of protein? I have heard recomendations for weight lifters in the realm of 1-1.5 g of protein per kg of body weight, for me that would be 80-120 g of protein! This sounds excessive, but a common among the powerlifting community. Any input or any way to increase protein consumption? I currently eat lots of nuts, have beans and whole grains at least once a day.I suspect you’re getting way more than 42 grams. I eat beans every day and some days I get 60-70 grams of protein. Plug in a day’s food to Cronometer.com and you might be surprised. I myself lost body fat after going 100% WFPB minimally processed no SOS, but I can still lift the same weight and continue to increase my strength.Yes, typically I consume anywhere from 40-50 g of protein sometimes less and sometimes more. I used to consume much more like closer to 100+ g a day. You don’t think I need more than just 40-50 g?At 180 lb. if you go with the 0.8gm/kg, that would be 65gm. protein for your weight (81kg). I get 50 or 60gm protein on a 2000 calorie plan. You must be eating way more than that? You have to count all the protein in all your food to get the total – even kale which is 20% protein :) It all adds up. Beans, whole grains, nuts etc. Just 1/2 cup oatmeal, 1 cup black beans, 1 oz walnuts and 2 slices whole wheat bread add up to 33gm protein.I am a personal trainer and body builder for the past 30 years.I have been vegan for over 13 years. I recently did a protein inventory just out of curiosity to see how much I was consuming on an average day. I weigh about 115 pounds so going with 1 gram of protein per kilogram body weight, I need about 52 grams of protein per day. I wasn’t trying to consume protein.I was just eating a wide variety of whole plant foods.I was shocked to learn I was consuming about 75 grams!! This is without even trying! As long as your caloric intake is adequate, I can almost guarantee you are getting enough protein.Matt, I found this discussion of plant protein you might find interesting : http://nakedfoodmagazine.com/muscling-out-the-meat-myth/You are definitely getting more then that if you add it up on https://cronometer.com/I don’t even try to eat or seek protein rich foods. My diet naturally gets close to 100 grams per day.You can’t force muscles to grow simply by consuming protein. Exercise determines muscle growth not diet. As long as you are consuming enough calories when you are hungry, till you are full, you will always be getting sufficient protein.The problem is to much protein plants a re loaded with them!Exercise and genetics. Only a small minority of people can gain muscle the way professional bodybuilders can.Even the American/Canadian Dietetic Associations claim that (at least for athletes:“Protein recommendations for endurance and strength-trained athletes range from 1.2 to 1.7 g/kg (0.5 to 0.8 g/lb) body weight per day. These recommended protein intakes can generally be met through diet alone, without the use of protein or amino acid supplements. Energy intake sufficient to maintain body weight is necessary for optimal protein use and performance.”“Position of the American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine: Nutrition and Athletic Performance” (2009) DOI: 10.1016/j.jada.2009.01.005Lets remember too that for an athlete, there would be an inherent increase in caloric needs, which would result in an unavoidable increase in protein.The food pyramid also isn’t inspired by independant scientific research but rather by corperate lobying.I workout every day, but I don’t do it to gain mass. Gaining mass, in my situation, is a “side effect”. Some time ago, I viewed a video from the Doc about fenugreek giving test subjects improved strength and mass in a matter of weeks. I tried it and was astonished how much stronger it made me. Look for the video and try it out.As for protein, I’m currently quite confused myself about it. I strive for 90 g/day at 75 kg of body weight. However, most days I get more like 70-75 g/day. I am vegan.But Dear Dr. Greger, you never mentioned the question of protein quality or more accurately, the amino acid profile of the vegetarian diets eaten. For the last half century, since Frances Moore Lappe published her seminal book: Diet For A Small Planet, and made her foundational point of the incomplete amino acid profile of plant-based eating, I have been obsessed with always eating the correct matching plant-based protein sources so as to complete the amino acid profile which is the true value as a protein food. My understanding is that the total number is not the definitive value (grams of protein). I thought that plant-based sources are amino-acid deficient and therefore must be eaten at the same time as it’s complementary amino-acid protein source, and without this conscious planning, the incomplete protein food would simply be processed and utilized by our body as carbohydrate. This is where I have always assumed most vegetarians go wrong, and in fact, the slow wound healing, small birth-weight babies, and impaired immune systems of improper vegetarian diets which can so easily be found among the strict vegetarians I lived with early in my life (intentional communities living on the land, eating only Organic before it was PC, and adhering to strict vegetarian principles without regard to matching amino acids). Please address and clarify this question for the many considering what might be sloppy amino-acid matching of their new plant-based diets. Don’t we need to educate ourselves and learn to make carefully selected combination choices of legume-grain-seed-nut-supplements before switching to a vegetarian diet?If I remember right, it was Dr. McDougall who noted in his writings or lectures that Frances Moore Lappe retracted her statements later after learning that it pretty much doesn’t matter when in the course of a 24 hours or longer that you eat a mix of amino acids, it will all come together. Further, it’s been shown that eating a variety of whole foods gets you there without having to worry about what you eat. I have never worried about after learning that.Ariel: Your concern is understandable as many people were mislead by that book. The author herself has since retracted that part of her book as a mistake on her part.Here are my two favorite sources for explaining human protein needs. Both of these sources address the problematic claims in the book Diet For A Small Planet.http://michaelbluejay.com/veg/protein.htmlhttp://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/newsletter/archives/ (check out December 2003 for McDougall’s site, “A Brief History of Protein: Passion, Social Bigotry, Rats, and Enlightenment”. Also April 2007, “When Friends Ask: Where do you get your protein?”)I hope that after you go through these sources, you will feel a huge sigh of relief. It means that you no longer need to stress about protein combining.Firstly, I would like to quote the American Dietetics Association on their view of vegetarian diets and protein.“Plant protein can meet protein requirements when a variety of plant foods is consumed and energy needs are met. Research indicates that an assortment of plant foods eaten over the course of a day can provide all essential amino acids and ensure adequate nitrogen retention and use in healthy adults; thus, complementary proteins do not need to be consumed at the same meal ”http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/2009_ADA_position_paper.pdfAs Jeff Novick puts it..Many say that plants foods are incompleteIf “incomplete” means not containing all the essential amino acids then…. (the incomplete protein theory)1) All plant foods are complete as they contain all the essential amino acids.2) the only food that is not a complete protein is an animal food, gelatin.If “incomplete” means lacking in sufficient quantity of one or more amino acids…(the limiting amino acid theory)1) Getting all the amino acids in at once at the same meal, or even in the same day, as some may suggest, is not necessary due to the amino acid pool, which is a circulating level of amino acids in the blood, that the body can draw from if needed. As long as one follows a whole foods plant based diet, the amino acid pool will maintain a sufficient stock of any potentially needed (or limiting) amino acids.2) However, as long as one consumes enough calories, eats a variety of food, and limits junk foods and refined foods, and is not an all fruit diet, then they will get in enough protein and enough amino acids in sufficient quantity. There will be no limiting amino acids3) there is some evidence that the amino acids that are slightly lower (but adequate) in plant foods, may actually be a benefit to health and longevity and not a concern.Most every major health organization including the NAS, the WHO and the ADA all recognize these statements to be true.All plants are whole proteins as long as you are eating a variety of whole food plant based foods you will get all that you need.Dr. Greger: Speaking of whole plant food diets, I hope you might comment soon on Dr. Perlmutter’s (MD) “grain brain” conclusions that all carbohydrates are harmful to the brain, including whole grains and fruits (in small amounts). His book is out and he’s been on PBS a lot with warning people to stay off carbs. I saw his PBS show but didn’t read his book. He might be conflating refined whole grains–like whole wheat flour–with whole grains in a natural or lightly processed state. Then again, he seems to have problems with beans too. He presents findings that a person’s risk of dementia is very strongly correlated to their blood sugar, and that today’s “normal” level is way too high. I just wonder how correct he is and how much nuance there might be in the data causing him to reach an incorrect general conclusion. If you have any findings that could help clarify, it would be great to hear your thoughts.He does soon, and if you can’t wait, buy the Volume 19 DVD and you can find out what he has to say about it today!Awesome! Thanks, Dr. Duda. Dr. Greger’s on top of it again. I’ll just wait for his comments to get posted. Dr. Perlmutter’s arguments didn’t really worry me. He seemed to lump too much together. I wasn’t convinced.mbglife: I like Dr. Duba’s answer. I too can’t wait to see what Dr. Greger has to say, and happily he is going to be saying something.If you are interested, here is also an answer from Dr. McDougal:January 2014: “The Smoke and Mirrors behind Wheat Belly and Grain Brain” by McDougall. https://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2014nl/jan/smoke.htmGreat! Thanks!I can’t believe they have guys like this on PBS. How about Dr Gregor doing something on PBS? Great way to reach a big audience like these no-carb folks but with something worthwhile. Does anyone know if McDougall, Campbell, etc have done anything on PBS?joeboosauce: I don’t know about McDougall or Campbell, but I believe that Dr. Barnard did at least two shows on PBS. I have two of Dr. Barnard’s DVDs which say, “As ween on Public TV” at the top. 1) Kickstart Your Health, 2) Protect Your Memory.Thea and Joeboosauce, PBS!! Thanks to PBS my boyfriend (with a big Post Concussion Syndrome) and I (with a skull fracture both from ice skating falls) improved our diets 4 yrs. ago watching Dr. Amen’s Healthy Brain show. But we were unable to find his studies on line or through his clinic website. So no expensive brain scans for us! Next PBS: Dr Fuhrman’s shows. Fantastic! But it took finding NF to be convinced WFPB was the way for us. So thank youPBS! But the number of awful health and nutrition shows PBS airs is appalling. DO they have no fact-checker to vet their doctors?How wonderful it would be to have Dr. Greger so a series with a few guest docs of high caliber and varying emphasis and ages! The one doc and sleepy or shill audience formulas are old. There are so many other ways to make these potentially life-changing shows more interesting and convincing.Just picture Dr. Greger in his fetching toque blanche preparing a meal with his humor and zest. Then perhaps cooking up a banquet with 3 other WFPB wizards including one or two lay people with before and after photos. A group discussion with the stories from people who have gone WFPB. Real people who have started recently or long ago this program. Let’s not forget some brawny firemen! And how about seniors who give people hope and healthy determination to do it too? I could skate a pairs program with a mystery guest revealed as Dr. Fuhrman, an olympian ice skater. Four people who watched my very modest Christmas skating exhibition last month told me they were inspired to change their diets and lifestyle so they might enjoy life as much as I do! Guess what site I sent them to!Gayle: Thanks for your post. I agree: PBS could be more responsible. But it is also a potential place for some great good to happen! Mabye after Dr. Greger finishes his book, he can start working on his PBS special. ;-) With all of those good ideas you have…PS: skating exhibition: That is SO, SO cool! Good for you! And it is just one more example of how being a role model can indeed be very powerful. Thanks for sharing.I caught that show on PBS myself the other day. I did not know what to think, but my first impulse was that this guy is another nut who blames all the ills of civilization on one thing – gluten … which always makes it much easier to get people interested and sell things from books to supplements.I don’t think he said all carbohydrates were bad, or maybe I just missed that part since I did not watch the whole thing.I saw a documentary on I think it was NetFlix called “Fresh” where they floated an idea that Alzheimer’s was a kind of diabetes of the brain, and that a lot of diseases could be viewed as the effects of too much sugar on different organs.I’m thinking “we” are learning a lot in science about health, nutrition and disease and closing in on some good findings, but we are not there are extreme recommendations that fall outside of the obvious – like we eat too much sugar and processed food and chemicals is uncalled for and probably not valid.Via Jeff Novick, please see here http://drmirkin.com/nutrition/forget-grain-brain-and-wheat-belly-eat-whole-grains.htmlThis grain brain theory is a bunch of nonsense. Dr. Perlmutter uses gluten as his proving point to why all carbs are bad. As a person with Celiac disease, I feel this diminishes the seriousness of this disease. The last thing a person with an auto-immune disease (Celiac) needs to do is center their diet around animal products. I eat gluten-free grains, beans and lots of complex carbs. Brown rice is especially healing for my compromised digestive tract.And people wonder why they are fat, constipated, get cancer, heartdisease, hypertension, diabetes and get depressed – it must be genetic! There must be a pill to pop! No – take control of your own health destiny. Eat right. Mostly WFPB diet.I saw the best bumper sticker today. “Animals die to feed your fat ass.”LOL. I want a sticker like that!Comon dudes. do you want to reach an audience or score points?Yeah, I’d prefer to help show that WFPB is a broad tent, myself. Note that Dr. Greger generally tries to play an optimistic tune that is more or less directly orthogonal to the ‘angry vegan’ projection, stereotype, and impediment to mass persuasion. He’s fully capable of writing angry vegan screed though. Carbophobia has some of that vibe.I absolutely agree with both of you. It just made me chuckle.Haha, you are right Coacervate! I like it but good point!> The only nutrient Americans may be more deficient in than fiber is potassium.Thanks for posting that and bringing up the subject of potassium. I don’t know what to think about potassium. The daily requirement for potassium is like 4 and a half grams. That is a lot of potassium.Potassium supplements, I think, by law can only have 99 milligrams, so that if you had to get your potassium from supplements you would need just under 50 pills to get enough.How is anyone supposed to get 4.5 grams of potassium a day. When I look at the potassium content of foods most foods have so little potassium that you would have to spend the whole day eating them to get enough potassium.Some coconut water has a lot of potassium … I think about half a gram of potassium per serving, which I think is one cup. Still that is 12 cups or coconut water.To get enough potassium one seems to have to build their whole diet around heavy potassium sources, and I am not even sure you can get enough any way you cut it.1. How was the daily requirement of potassium set? Is it really so high.2. Why is potassium so hard to get, or even supplement?The 4.7 g AI for potassium was set by the U.S. Food and Nutrition board with the rationale set forth here, as one that would “lower blood pressure levels, reduce the adverse effects of sodium chloride intake on blood pressure, reduce the risk of recurrent kidney stones, and possibly decrease bone loss”. As there are antagonistic interactions with sodium, it seems possible that those eating a low salt diets could get by with less.In pill form, potassium can lodge against the intestinal walls and cause lesions. Since 1975, the U.S. FDA has required a long warning label on supplements containing 100 mg or more potassium, so non-prescription potassium supplements in the U.S. all have 99 mg.It’s not hard to get enough potassium eating whole plant foods. A medium (2 3/4″ diam.) potato, a 10 oz. package of spinach, or 1 1/3 cup cooked lentils each have 1 g, so there’s 3 g K in 550 calories.Medjool dates have a fair bit as well. I only mention this as they are so delicious and for many vegans a regular treat.I knew you would put this into a usable bit of info!Thanks for the info …… but think about what you are saying … i medium potato, 10 oz. spinach and 1/3 cup lentils … that is a lot of bulk to eat everyday, and it still does not get to the 4.5, though you quality the 3.5 number credibly.There is also the fact that a lot of the nutrition info that we get about foods is wrong or inflated. Unless they put potassium into the ground in quantity enough to have it taken up into the tuber we will have potatoes with less nutrition than what the stats say. I don’t trust the agriculture industry anymore on these issues.I’m just thinking what you said does not refute my statement that it is hard to get enough potassium in a diet without eating certain key foods in quantity everyday and planning your diet around potassium.Maybe the potassium in a potato is mostly in the skin so one could avoid all the carbs and starch of a whole potato, or increase the potato “dose” to 2 if just eating the skin.Potassium is a required nutrient in agriculture, and unlike trace minerals (selenium etc), its liberally added to top-soil in both conventional and organic agriculture. Its the 3rd number in NPK ratings of fertilizers.Darryl, do you eat green bananas or cooked potatoes that have been cooled, or do you add raw potato starch to stuff? Or do you think we get enough resistant starch just from a few servings of beans and eating a WFPB diet. Should I add some raw potato starch to my smoothies? Or should I eat one green banana a day? I bet eating a cooked and cooled purple potato would be really good. I wonder how long it has to be cooled?Hi Ben. If I really needed more calories, I might think of adding potato starch to the morning smoothie, or making more glass noodle (pre-gelatinized starch) dishes. For the most part, I think I’m doing fine with daily beans and the occassional potato to feed my gut flora and colonocytes. As for details about cooking/cooling techniques to maximize retrogradation in say, potatoes, it appears the cooking temperature has to be above boiling (100 C/212 F), but its retrogradation is maximized if maintained at a higher temperature for a while. Ie, roasting potatoes in the oven and (!) turning it off before leaving for work. I haven’t done this experiment, and the whole subject is pretty new to me.Thanks, Darryl!I have an idea to make a purple potato salad. Potato salads taste great cold. It’s easy to make an oil free mayonnaise with tofu.Darryl or anyone else here….I am truly in need some guidance from someone who actually gets the complexity of health in regards to vitamin D. My child – 19 years old – gets outbreaks of cold-sores/lip herpes every time he takes vitamin D supplements. The type of D, the amount, etc., they all do the same thing. Same thing happens when he eats fish with D, like salmon and sardines. Vegan D also. He has autoimmune ailments – psoriasis – and latest doctor told us vitamin D can suppress immune system in patients who have autoimmune disorders. Sunshine does not create viral outbreaks in him, so D is ok there, but the big issue is that the “D” from the supplements and that naturally occurring in food also are triggering other autoimmune issues when he takes or ingests the food – like facial twitching – bells palsy sort of – and he gets sick as well. Flu symptoms, very tired for days upon taking D. So, is the doctor correct that for some people, “D” reduces immune power and opens one up to latent viruses? Much appreciated, your insight.Try vitamin D mushrooms. Mushrooms are a real superfood and immune system enhancer and it shouldn’t cause him any problems if he is not sensitive to sunlight since that’s where the mushrooms are getting the vitmain D, from sunlight.Almost every fruit has at least 10% of the DV of potassium. Please see here. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/98-of-american-diets-potassium-deficient/The food highest in Potassium is the tomato.This is good news, I eat a plant based diet, no meat or dairy. and this is the best time of the year to do so..farmer’s markets are everywhere. I get the same question, where do you get your protein, and I reply from my food. I have the lab results to prove it.If we all get a double load of protein, why don’t we all get metabolic acidosis?Arguably, we do.Just read it, thanks! Could we conclude that the high K content of a WFPB diet offsets the protein ENAP load?this paper is a bit dated…do you know of any further developments? Just wondering, are you a teacher, Prof. or self educated?Here’s a 2011 review of diet induced metabolic acidosis (link will d/l a pdf). Dr. Greger covered the shifting assessment on where the urinary calcium was coming from and where it was harming us (in muscle loss) in two videos last year: Alkaline Diets, Animal Protein, & Calcium Loss Testing Your Diet with Pee & Purple CabbageI’m just trying to get an understanding of this. The review states:” Persons consuming a diet based on animal protein have higherkidney net acid excretion and more acidic urinary pH than persons on a plant-based diet. The urinary excretion of sulfate, phosphate,and uric acid is also higher in persons on the animal protein diet,compared with the vegetarian diet.”This turns virtually everything I’ve been taught (and repeating as an authority) on its ear. For example, we touted dairy as a high sulfur, high phosphate protein. So superior to plant foods. So healthy. How could we have gotten it so wrong?Question: I am tempted to reduce my intake of protein, eat more starches until my urine pH rises to the higher side of normal. Would that be a worthwhile exercise?We got it wrong for so long due to well-intentioned scientists applying the lessons of early 20th century nutrition (vitamin deficiencies cause disease) to macronutrients like protein. Within broad limits, excesses of many vitamins aren’t problematic, so perhaps nutrition need only concern itself with the minimum requirements for protein, too.The lessons from nutrition for the last 50 years are mostly about nutritional excess. Saturated fat and added sugars have both come under well-deserved scrutiny, but there are also issues with excess protein: in aggregate, stimulating sometimes unwelcome growth signalling, and of specific amino acids, like methionine. I think experimental gerontologists are at the forefront of this change, as the last decade has pinned down some mechanisms for how caloric restriction extended lifespan, and at least half of the effect can now be attributed to protein restriction.I too am conducting an N=1 experiment. I believe unless your diet is largely added sugars, fats, alcohol or low protein foods like cassava and taro, its highly unlikely you’ll face any amino acid deficiencies, though a couple servings of beans daily will provide a margin of safety for lysine (the amino acid of concern in vegan diets). It’s very difficult to be protein deficient eating only whole plant foods, but they can provide protein moderation.Regarding protein restriction, I am somewhat skeptical for a couple of reasons:1) Epidemiological data suggest a strong inverse relationship between protein intake (both animal and plant-based) and fracture risk (so osteoporosis).2) Anyone who engages in strength/resistance training will likely need to increase their protein intake, as will elderly persons at risk for sarcopenia.3) Protein intake is net neutral or even positive with respect to metabolic syndrome risk, unlike processed carbohydrates or saturated fat. I believe this is especially the case with plant-based proteins.4) Protein is uniquely satiating in a way that carbs are not. I find nothing so satiating as a bowl of edamame (without salt or oil), as a snack.I am not saying we should all go out and eat a bunch of steak, but it is difficult to maintain a plant-based diet largely based on carbs, especially for those of us who are at risk for metabolic syndrome.Yes indeed, I’ve heard about a certain road paved with good intentions. With science the truth eventually comes out. The candle sputters in the darkness, then brightens…Maybe the next edition of Fennema will illuminate?I AM taking your comments onboard, but I checked our pH’s this AM: Mine is 6.5 and hers is 7.1 Some references state normal urine pH ranges from 4 to 8.She is always better than me…she has total control. I want to get into the 7+ range and see if my general joint/pain level improves.I’ve found myself trending towards high protein meals and even cheating with some seafood and parmesean…so I’m determined to redouble the effort and get my pH as alkaline as a reasonable diet change can muster. But I take your point regarding protein restriction.Question: Do you think increasing high K foods is a good way to bring up pH? We both eat a lot of beans/greens/bananas already.Your experiment … are you doing anthing specifically to limit protein overload?Also, we’ve been eating a lot of beet, rocket and other high nitrate foods. Could high dietary nitrate trend one towards the acidic side?Darryl, you help a lot of people here. Thanks for taking the trouble.I don’t think protein restriction (as some animal lifespan studies) is really feasible or wise, but moderation of specific amino acids like methionine may account for some of the advantages of plant protein sources. High protein intake can strengthen bones and prevent frailty, and the Levine et al. paper clearly points out the advantage of <10% protein diets was limited to those 19-65. What's exciting to me is that the pathways involved for later life disease reduction from mid-life protein moderation (or choice) are becoming clearer.Some IGF-1/mTOR activation is necessary for muscle/bone maintenance, and if that proves mostly a matter of leucine intake, then perhaps higher leucine / methionine ratio proteins like lentils, adzuki beans and split peas can provide most of the benefits with fewer of the drawbacks. Leucine is also the amino acid most responsble for satiety through hypothalamic mTOR activation. Personally, I'm kinda hoping myostatin inhibitors will be approved by the time frailty looms.There's also a fascinating and understudied story with glycine. One group calcuates glycine may be a semi-essential amino acid with widespread deficiencies potentially leading to collagen loss and osteoporosis. It may also work as an antidote to excess methionine (see also). WRT glycine, animal proteins have an advantage, though legumes are the food group with the highest glycine / methionine ratio.The problem with mechanistic data is that “the road to hell is paved with biological plausibility”. Isolating the effects of one micronutrient in vitro or in animal models or even in humans is a mug’s game of reductionistic science. Then when these things get applied in large randomized trials, they usually fail (or worse), as seen with the antioxidant vitamins or the amino acid L-arginine. And mechanistic science is often internally contradictory – soy protein increases IGF-1, yet in Far East Asian societies, soy appears to be protective against some common cancer types. I think what we are finding is that there are a million ways to go plant-based. Individuals have different physiologies, and some react very poorly to excesses in certain macronutrients (e.g. carbohydrates). I salute you for doing your N=1 trial. We are all doing that. I have recently added a number of non-nutritional modalities (yoga, meditation, exercise) to see how I can complement the nutritional approach to better health.I went to the study via the link “One group? in your comment above. Fascinating! I could only mildly understand the introduction and the Conclusion sections, but now wonder if we elders should take Glycene supplements since it seems harmless in the domes mentioned and since deficiencies are invisible in the short term. Here is the conscusion for those of you whose biochemistry, like mine, is not up to snuff: (Going to the linked paper is best, pasting is awkward here)“The shortage of glycine may become serious in conditions such as pregnancy and old age, especially if accompanied by malnutrition. So, even though glycine cannot be regarded as indispensable for survival, because failure to maintain collagen in a healthy state is not lethal, it is required for adequate synthesis of collagen and for a healthy level of protein turnover. In fact, people with a protein-deficient diet adapt by decreasing protein turnover (Gibson et al. 2002). However, although this adaptation allows survival it has secondary effects, because the increased lifetimes of proteins increase the probability of their undergoing undesirable chemical modifications, such as oxidation, glycation and cross-linking, which can alter their activities. Even though the turnover of collagen may be slow, it is increased in elderly people (Mays et al. 1991; Lohmander et al. 1996, 2003; Passeri et al. 2003), which may be explained by the increase in modified collagen which is more susceptible to collagenases. Thus, even though survival is not threatened by a shortage of glycine, the quality of life certainly is. Conditions such as a protein-deficient diet that decrease protein turnover, and consequently increase the life-span of collagen (Gibson et al. 2002), also decrease the need for glycine, of course; in extreme conditions the glycine shortage may even disappear, as collagen turnover decreases enormously. However, this glycine dispensability is moreapparent than real because with time the glycation of collagen promotes extra covalent cross-links between chains, reducing plasticity (Finkelstein 2004). A healthy physiology of the organism therefore requires collagen to be renewed. So a decrease in collagen turnover, although it is a mechanism to allow survival of the organism, has important secondary effects, including ageing. On the other hand, the shortage of glycine may increase substantially during pregnancy, as collagen and elastin synthesis increases with development of the uterus.The natural conclusion from our analysis is that the quality of life can be improved by taking glycine as a nutritional supplement according to the calculated deficiency (about 10 g daily), to guarantee adequate synthesis and renovation of collagen. Before reaching this conclusion, we need to ask whether an excess of glycine in the diet may have secondary effects, especially as it is a neurotransmitter. However, non- essential amino acids such as glycine and aspartic acid do not significantly penetrate the blood–brain barrier (Baños et al. 1975; Davson 1976). Furthermore, Directive 67/548/EEC of the European Union describes glycine as ‘not hazardous’, as it does not become toxic in rats when taken orally until a gigantic dose of 8 g/kg is reached, corresponding to around 600 g in a human.There is also an evolutionary puzzle: if glycine deficiency is a serious problem in all large animals, as these studies suggest, why has it not been overcome by natural selection? Despite the importance of this question, we have not discussed it here, in part because we have done so in a previous paper (Meléndez-Hevia and de Paz-Lugo 2008), and in part because it requires a more profound discussion than is appropriate in a paper that is mainly concerned with nutritional aspects. In addition, animals in the wild have substantially more exercise than is common for many modern humans, and it will therefore be desirable in the future to study and analyse the effects of exercise.It is surprising that despite the reports from different nutritional studies of shortages of glycine, the implication that it is an essential amino acid has not been readily accepted, though the list of essential amino acids has been revised in other respects within the past 25 years. For example, the question of whether histidine is an essential amino acid was controversial for many years, until 1985, when FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) stated in a Technical Report on the basis of the clinical nutritional studies of Kopple and Swendseid (1975) and Stifel and Herman (1972) that it is essential for humans. In the case of glycine, the resistance is probably due to the fact that glycine deficiency is difficult or impossible to detect in the short term, especially in a small animal such as a rat. The effects are in the long term, and shortage will contribute to the development of osteoarthritis and osteoporosis, typical degenerative diseases of old age, and among the few health problems found in large wildanimals – in general, animals over 40 kg in adult weight – including elephants (Weissengruber et al. 2006), dogs (Mahan 1978), rhinoceros, giraffes, etc. Collagen-related problems are well documented in nature, and are much more ancient than human culture (Ackernecht 1953). They cannot therefore be attributed to unhealthy modern dietary habits, or even to the modification in human diet brought about by the spread of agriculture in the past 5000 years. However, a task for the future will be to estimate the amount of glycine that can be supplied by microorganisms present in the digestive tract, which we have been unable to consider in the present study due to the absence of suitable data, but which may well affect the varying frequency of collagen-related diseases in animals with different systems of digestion.J. Biosci. 34(6), December 2009collagen promotes extra covalent cross-links between chains, reducing plasticity (Finkelstein 2004). A healthy physiology of the organism therefore requires collagen to be renewed. So a decrease in collagen turnover, although it is a mechanism to allow survival of the organism, has important secondary effects, including ageing. On the other hand, the shortage of glycine may increase substantially during pregnancy, as collagen and elastin synthesis increases with development of the uterus.The natural conclusion from our analysis is that the quality of life can be improved by taking glycine as a nutritional supplement according to the calculated deficiency (about 10 g daily), to guarantee adequate synthesis and renovation of collagen. Before reaching this conclusion, we need to ask whether an excess of glycine in the diet may have secondary effects, especially as it is a neurotransmitter. However, non- essential amino acids such as glycine and aspartic acid do not significantly penetrate the blood–brain barrier (Baños et al. 1975; Davson 1976). Furthermore, Directive 67/548/EEC of the European Union describes glycine as ‘not hazardous’, as it does not become toxic in rats when taken orally until a gigantic dose of 8 g/kg is reached, corresponding to around 600 g in a human.There is also an evolutionary puzzle: if glycine deficiency is a serious problem in all large animals, as these studies suggest, why has it not been overcome by natural selection? Despite the importance of this question, we have not discussed it here, in part because we have done so in a previous paper (Meléndez-Hevia and de Paz-Lugo 2008), and in part because it requires a more profound discussion than is appropriate in a paper that is mainly concerned with nutritional aspects. In addition, animals in the wild have substantially more exercise than is common for many modern humans, and it will therefore be desirable in the future to study and analyse the effects of exercise.It is surprising that despite the reports from different nutritional studies of shortages of glycine, the implication that it is an essential amino acid has not been readily accepted, though the list of essential amino acids has been revised in other respects within the past 25 years. For example, the question of whether histidine is an essential amino acid was controversial for many years, until 1985, when FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) stated in a Technical Report on the basis of the clinical nutritional studies of Kopple and Swendseid (1975) and Stifel and Herman (1972) that it is essential for humans. In the case of glycine, the resistance is probably due to the fact that glycine deficiency is difficult or impossible to detect in the short term, especially in a small animal such as a rat. The effects are in the long term, and shortage will contribute to the development of osteoarthritis and osteoporosis, typical degenerative diseases of old age, and among the few health problems found in large wildanimals – in general, animals over 40 kg in adult weight – including elephants (Weissengruber et al. 2006), dogs (Mahan 1978), rhinoceros, giraffes, etc. Collagen-related problems are well documented in nature, and are much more ancient than human culture (Ackernecht 1953). They cannot therefore be attributed to unhealthy modern dietary habits, or even to the modification in human diet brought about by the spread of agriculture in the past 5000 years. However, a task for the future will be to estimate the amount of glycine that can be supplied by microorganisms present in the digestive tract, which we have been unable to consider in the present study due to the absence of suitable data, but which may well affect the varying frequency of collagen-related diseases in animals with different systems of digestion.In the last month, a couple of European vegetarian friends have written me saying there is now research (they have not sent the links!) that shows people over 65 need to increase their protein significantly to thrive. Any thoughts, Darryl?According to the WHO, the protein requirements for all adults (elderly or not) is 0.83 g/kg (with small margins of safety). However because the elderly typically are sedentary and consume fewer calories overall, that may represent up to 13% of daily calories, whereas for physically active you adults it may be a low as 4% (see Table 3, pg 87).Per the discussion on pg 114, a past concern for lower protein diets in the elderly was muscle wasting, however more recent studies have shown the major determinant is amount of resistance exercise. With resistance training, muscle strength in the elderly can be increased with just 0.8 g/kg protein intake. And amore recent meta-analysis found no advantage to protein supplements in strength gains from resistance exercise in the elderly.Its possible your European friends are referring to last year’s Levine et al paper which found that in those under 65, a protein intake of > 20% energy was associated with 75% greater mortality and 4-fold greater cancer than intake of < 10%, but for those over 65, a protein intake of 10-20% calories resulted in 21% lower mortality than intakes < 10%. A straightforward argument, given the their lower energy needs noted in the WHO report, is that many elderly < 10% protein represents a serious protein deficiency given minimum requirements can be as high as 13%. As a practical matter, its fairly difficult getting less than 13% of energy from protein eating a whole plant based diet. While there are some very low protein staples like cassava and taro, lower protein intakes generally require a lot of added sugars, fats, and alcohol or high intakes of refined foods like corn starch and arguably fruit juice.One way to ensure you're getting enough protein on a plant-based diet is to enter some sample daily menus on CRON-o-meter, and ensure that you’re getting at least 30 mg/kg weight of the amino acid lysine (and perhaps 15 mg/kg methionine). Generally, for plant-based dieters, if lysine is adequate the rest of the essential amino acids are as well. A few servings of legumes daily will go a long way towards ensuring adequate balance.I’m wondering about the glutamic acid in food sources of protein–and particularly concerned about the research showing glutamine can fuel cancer cell survival. Do cells make their own glutamine independent of dietary sources? To what degree do dietary sources become fuel for cells? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335942/Glutamic acid (glutamate) is non-essential, and our bodies can produce needed amounts from other energy and nitrogen sources. There are important enzymes that catalyze conversion to an intermediate in the Krebs cycle central to aerobic respiration (achieving carbon balance between carbs and proteins), converting to another non-essential amino acid glutamine (the major free amino acid in body fluids), and to ammonia (used in acid-base balance). Ie, Glutamate is a tightly regulated key intermediate in whole-body homeostasis, and normal intakes don’t shift levels much.As glutamate is also the amino acid responsible for the savoury / umani taste of MSG, much work has been done on potential toxicity and the major issue appears to be gastrointestinal distress at high / unlikely intakes as glutamate is also a key exitatory neurotransmitter. I’ve searched for studies that might link MSG intake to cancer risk, and found none (including studies where rats ate 5% MSG for 2 years). So I’ll wouldn’t avoid MSG, soy sauce, nutritional yeast, Marmite or other umani flavorings due to cancer issues. Some studies indicate pharmaceutical glutamate receptor antagonists may have promise in cancer treatment.What about inflammatory conditions in the brain? Do you think avoiding glutamate is a good strategy for decreasing brain inflammation?I eat according to Dr. McDougall based on “The Starch Solution”. Starches every meal plus colorful non-starchy veggies, whole grains, legumes and fruits. When I got meat and dairy out of my diet, I actually reversed osteoporosis. Countries with the highest dairy consumption have the highest rates of osteoporosis.This vid is a spearhead to the very heart of everything isn’t it?? Really Awesome.haha! YEP, the title says “protein”–gets everyone’s attention…then it ends up being more about FIBER…far more important!!!! So, I shared this on my FB page…hope at least ONE fb friend learns something from it!This vid just goes the the very heart of all of it doesn’t it? Really awesome, broad stroked and poignant at the same time. Giterdone.What is the word on this new book “The Big Fat Surprise”? http://online.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-big-fat-surprise-by-nina-techolz-1401923948. Is saturated fat now good for us? Just another excuse for meat eaters?I can’t read the article but to me it seems another confusionist book like Gary Taubes and co… i suggest you to take your time and watch the work of Plantpositive:http://www.plantpositive.com/Start from “The Primitive Nutrition Series”… it’s a must see for my point of view…Thanks! I will take a look.Since I predict it’s unlikely that most people are going to bother reading this book, I’d suggest you also have a look at Michael Eades’ encomiastic review and CarbSane’s negative evaluation of the book as well as the mainstream publicity. There’s broad support for the idea that this work is largely derivative of Taubes, however you stand with respect to the book’s truth and honesty. Taubes apparently had something of a hand in shaping the manuscript.So specifically I’d say that Nina is mostly a clone of Taubes, and her book may be even less rigorous than GCBC.careful of false sense of safety and overload on soy !! too much soy is like too much protean and become carcinogenic no different from too much meat.I think if I have to summarize my plant based diet in one sentence: I only eat foods containing significant fiber, nothing else except for water.nice Borkent!!! I strive to also say the same! I try to figure out: how can I put more fiber in my breakfast.lunch.dinner.?I would love to see Dr. Greger address hair loss and veganism. I am experiencing this for the first time in my life. I have always had a very thick head of hair. I have been a vegetarian for 11 years (no problem with that) but after being vegan for 1 1/2 years, my hair is thinning. I know quite a few women who stopped being vegan for this exact reason. What is the supplementation we should be taking, or what foods should we be eating more of to avoid this?How is your thyroid function? Do you take a kelp or iodine supplement, or eat seaweed? Iodine is essential for thyroid metabolism, and if you are whole foods plant-based, you won’t be getting a lot of iodine or iodized salt. One sign of hypothyroidism is alopecia.yesyes…eat a sheet of nori each day! I do it…and one of my cats fights me for it!Iron?Look into to supplementing with Amla powder. Dr. Gregor recommends it as possibly the best non-toxic superfood and many people claim it helps them with their hair, prevents and/or helps with regrowth. It’s anecdotal but worth a shot since there are many health benefits to taking the Amla.The first time I tried to become vegan (from a vegetarian starting spot), I had several problems including thinning hair and hair loss. Nevertheless, although vegan, my diet wasn’t healthy. I was eating mostly soy milk and whole-wheat bread (which had sugar, fructose, etc. added). The second time I tried going vegan, I did it following to the Doc’s recommendations and my hair is more than fine with even less hair loss than when I was a pescetarian.Sebastian: Your story is very interesting and may be the key to understanding what is going on. I have a family member who had a lot of hair loss prior to going vegan. After she went vegan, the hair loss stopped and even started to fill in a little bit (though not a full reversal).Thanks for sharing your personal experience.I find this topic to be extremely confusing. One vegan RD recommends 1.1 g/kg of protein ( http://veganhealth.org/articles/protein ), and I have found that the addition of plant-based protein to the diet really helps with exercise and satiety. Protein intake is inversely related to fracture risk.A quick question for Dr. Greger – you noted that most everyone, carnivores and herbivores alike, are getting more protein than they need. Is that a problem that vegans and vegetarians should worry about? Dr. Campbell has noted that protein in excess of about 12% of total calories can be carcinogenic. Or is plant-based protein not a reason for concern? Thanks!I wish there were more data on the optimum amount of protein for quality of life and thriving, not just the minimum to avoid protein deficiency. This would be useful information. People often say that they include protein sources in their diet, not because they “need” more protein, but because it helps stabilize their blood sugar, keeping them full longer. This not an argument for eating animal protein. One can accomplish this using plant protein sources, such as tofu or protein powder, such as pea, rice, or hemp protein.Dr. McDougall’s starch based plan results in weight loss, more than enough protein but the potatoes, rice, sweet potatoes and whole grains are filling and satiating as are the legumes and beans. I am never hungry when eating starchy foods every meal. I think we tend to get wrapped up in the minutia of numbers, but a whole food plant-based minimally processed diet provides perfect nutrition. Excess protein is hard on the kidneys and older people have less kidney function as the years go by.Excellent come-back to the ever-present question “where do you get your protein” (ie, that fibre is the issue, not protein). But still I would have liked to see an answer that included reference people eating an omnivorous diet get more protein than their kidneys can handle, leading to a variety of health problems.Maybe you are aware but in case not: you can view more protein videos here: http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=too+much+proteinThis video is interesting. It starts out showing the large epidemiological study done in JAMA 2013 to lay the ground work. In this study, pescetarians had the best odds ratio for all-case mortality (0.82) – which means, they are the healthiest, and live the longest (die the least often), etc. However, at the end, the video then claims that the BEST diet is whole food plant based (with no animal protein).Interesting……About the conversation with TC Campbell, in his China Study audio version, he mentions that he doesn’t eat animal based protein, but this only happen a few years previous to the publication of the book.It is also interesting to note, that the data IS VERY CLEAR (according to his studies), that eating animal protein in your diet up to 5% is NOT harmful. But 20% of animal protein IS harmful. That is hard data. So 5% or less is okay of animal protein. Actually, based on this data, we can’t even say “animal protein.” Most of the science is from cow protein. It is likely a stretch to say all animal protein is the same.The real problem with animal protein (studies have shown) is the fact that they have such a high content of Omega-6 oil. If you eat corn feed animals, and a “normal” diet, your omega-6/omega-3 intake is about 15:1. This is highly inflammatory and needs to be more like a 3:1 to 1:1 ratio. Unfortunately, no study that I am aware of has been done to compare an omnivore diet with naturally feed animals, vs an omnivore diet vs corn feed animals. The only thing we really have is the study first shown in this video that – once again – clearly shows that pescetarian diet is the healthiest.Also, just noticed he didn’t have that article referenced in his sources list. It must have been an oversite. Here is the reference.Orlich, Michael J., et al. “Vegetarian dietary patterns and mortality in Adventist Health Study 2.” JAMA internal medicine 173.13 (2013): 1230-1238.Bread? Whole grains?http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-sheridan/high-fiber-more-like-unde_b_5462165.html?utm_hp_ref=healthy-livingGreat article… I am just embarking on adopting a vegetarian diet and have discovered that it really isn’t difficult to make tasty and satisfying meals that provide adequate amounts of protein. I feel much better as a result. But I do have a question–not directly pertaining to the protein question though. I have purchased several cookbooks–Forks over Knives, The China Study cookbook, and Dr. Neal Bernard’s Get Healthy, Go Vegan… I notice in all three that there is no use of oil at all, even the healthy varieties (avocado, olive, etc). These are plant based oils; I’m having trouble keeping up with the changing philosophies regarding oils— years ago it was no-fat, then the philosophy changed to indicate that low-fat really wasn’t a good way to go. Are we back to the no-fat philosophy again or is the lack of oil in these 3 cookbooks related to the vegetarian diet?This video barley talks about vegetarian diets; the title is quite misleading. It is hard to find information about vegan/vegetarian diets that doesnt actually focus on meat diets. Annoying.And by barley I mean “barely” LOL, funny vegan slip :DWhere did the 40 grams average protein need level cited here come from? The often quoted .8/kg of body weight means a 170 pound person (77.1 kg) should consume 62 grams of protein.I have a question. Why is it that vegetarians consume dairy and eggs when they are ethically against the slaughter of animals for human consumption? The dairy and egg industries treat cows and chickens inhumanely and they suffer greaty, so how can they condone those abuses?I am 46. I am 5’8 and weigh 56.8 kg. I am vegan. I do moderate exercise 3 times a week and weight about 1-2 times a week. The trainer I work with at the gym says that I need 80g protein (and I need lots of soy). Based on your article and online calculators I think it should be less, max 45g per week, (which i can get following a varied plant based diet.) Who is right? Also, can you get too much plant based protein (excluding isolated plant protein)?Betseyb: I love the protein questions because there are generally very clear answers to them. If you work your way through the following two articles, I think you will be very happy with the answers. More importantly, you will have good clear data and understanding of protein to use when you end up having “the protein discussion” with other people.http://michaelbluejay.com/veg/protein.htmlFor McDougall’s site, find December 2003 and the article, “A Brief History of Protein: Passion, Social Bigotry, Rats, and Enlightenment”. http://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/newsletter/archives/I would add to Thea’s suggestions two further McDougall Newsletters, April 2007… Where do I get my Protein, and January 2004… Protein Overload. Given adequate calories protein is a nonissue for the general population. Given current science we should not go out of our way to consume extra protein. Of course there may be some people with metabolic disorders that don’t fit these general rules. Congrats on your healthy lifestyle and keep tuned to NF.org as the science keeps coming.I check my numbers occasionally on Cronometer. Last check I got 79 gm fiber, 77 gm protein. Well over 100% of the RDA for essential amino acids, a nice Omega 6:3 ratio of 1.6:1, 100% of RDA for minerals and Vitamins (except B12 and D). And 10.1% total fat which is the figure showing reversal of heart disease. All on a WFPB minimally processed plan with no oil or added sugar and salt. Lots of energy for weight lifting and 5 grandkids!42g Protein/day??? The is a total load of bull. Firstly, protein requirements are based on g/kg or % of kcals. Secondly, take a look at Rajavel Elango and colleague’s work regarding protein requirements using the indicator amino acid method:“The indicator amino acid oxidation-based requirement values of 0.93 and 1.2 g protein/kg/day and the reanalysis of existing nitrogen balance studies are significantly higher than current recommendations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reassess recommendations for protein intake in adult humans.”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19841581So, I think it’s more likely that you have confirmed that most vegetarians/vegans do NOT get adequate protein in their diet. The fact that you present other parts of the diet that are generally lacking is just a red herring in regards to the protein argument.Hi Dr. Gregor – LOVE LOVE LOVE the new website! I was hoping you could do a video/article soon regarding the recent popularity of Pea Protein and it’s potential safety, benefits (or lack thereof). I’ve had difficulty in locating reliable (unbiased) information about pea protein. Some online articles indicate that HYDROLYZED pea protein can contain free glutamic acid or msg, but not all pea proteins are hydrolyzed. I’m not generally a fan of single-macronutrient products like protein powders anyway and try to get my nutrients from whole foods as much as possible, but it’s nice to have the option sometimes if I’m making a shake or smoothie to get a protein boost as I just haven’t seemed to build up the stomach capacity on an plant based diet to fit all that food in there, and sometimes I just want a break from nut/seed butters, quinoa and whole soy. This was recommended by a vegan food blogger who is highly educated and who I respect greatly so I tried it and really like it. I would greatly appreciate your insights into this topic AND you’ll be just about the first major nutrition name to address it (Sorry, haven’t considered Dr. oz to be one in years). Thank you! I hope to see a response in one of your upcoming email updates. I can’t begin to tell you how much the valuable information you provide here has helped me improve my life and health, and that of people care about. Much thanks and blessings to you. This is the particular product I’ve been trying http://www.nuzest-usa.com/How come nutrition labels do not include an RDA percentage for protein? This value can be derived from the other known values (fat calories+carbohydrate calories+protein calories=total calories, assuming we are not including alcohol) but why is it not listed? I am pretty sure that I remember seeing a percent value years ago but now it is not there. Is there lobbying going on behind the scenes to keep the value off the label? The fda website does not seem to be of any use on the issue. Thank you!I have been a strict vegetarian for over 10 years but starting to relax abit as I am concerned with some of the data and whether for instance eating organic dairy yogurt will really cause me to have breast cancerOrganic or not, dairy products are really not that healthful. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-intake-and-igf-1-production/brit: I don’t believe anyone on this site has ever said that eating dairy will “cause you to have breast cancer”. It’s not that simple. However, eating dairy can greatly increase your *risk* of getting breast cancer, along with other health issues.You can learn more about dairy in general by looking at this page: http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/If cancer is your only concern, I understand that there are several ways in which dairy links to cancer/breast cancer. Here is one video on the topic: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hormones-in-skim-vs-whole-milk/re: “…starting to relax a bit as I am concerned with some of the data…” That’s interesting, because the more data that I see, the more I see the importance of being a strict vegetarian.Good luck.Dr. McGregor, I recently experience a water fast at True North. While I had great results, my sugar addiction came back and I have gained half of the weight back. Well enough is enough, I am training for a bikini competition for July 2015 startingat ground zero and all of these trainers are protein protein protein, supplement, supplement, supplement. I want to train plant based with out all the protein powders and weird supplementation (BCAA’s et all) Am I misinformed or are they? The training isn’t as rigorous as people think: 3-5 45 minute weight training episodes a week a 3 20 minute cardio a week. I eat beans and I eat varied (when i am not being an addict) I take a B12 and D3 and that is it.How does one manage the advice to add only 5g extra fiber/day each week? If one must, due to circumstance, make a large leap in fiber consumption, are there strategies to help the body manage? I don’t want our visiting relatives to have a week of “no go” when they stay with us and enjoy all the delicious fresh plant foods that we serve them each meal.There are people, such as myself, who cannot digest beans well. I have tried many times in the past to eat beans, and every single time, I had digestion, stomach, and bloating issues. And, it’s the same with fiber. Even when I increase my fiber intake by 5 grams as suggested, I once again start having stomach problems and bloating. The maximum amount of fiber that I have ever been able to eat in a day without having issues is 15 grams. Psyllium husks work well however, and are an exception. I would suggest that people with sensitive digestion systems increase their fiber intake using psyllium husks alone. My final conclusion, not based on studies, but based on my own body’s ability to handle certain foods over years of personal dietary self-experiments is this: It’s not wise to lump everyone together for guidelines. Different people may have different tolerances for different foods. No one size fits all.I would like to see how this squares for people who have had gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. I just have a sleeve done recently to get my weight under control. I am still not yet eating normal food, but protein is the thing they push the most and then get in the fiber after. So they are essentially pushing a largely meat diet. I intend to get most of my proteins from beans, especially chick peas–one of the highest sources.Some vegan dietitians say that vegans often find it difficult to get enough lysine (an essential amino acid) in their diets. Does Dr. Greger agree?If you eat beans, nuts (especially pistachios), and seeds and grains like quinoa you’ll get plenty of lysine.Hi I have been vegetarian for one year and my hair has become thin and falls considerably now. I started eating fish one month ago and I take care of taking enough proteins, I take a vitamin complex every morning and I eat quite a lot of vegetables and fruits, but my hair still falls (around 4 hairs every time I pass my hand through it). It is quite scaring and I would like to stop this from happening.I would be thankful if you could give me some advice. And also, does the hair that falls because of dietary changes or deficiencies regrows?Thank you!","['animal fat', 'animal protein', 'beans', 'blood pressure', 'calories', 'cancer', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cardiovascular health', 'cholesterol', 'dairy', 'diabetes', 'dietary guidelines', 'eggs', 'fat', 'fiber', 'fish', 'flexitarians', 'folate', 'foodborne illness', 'fruit', 'grains', 'heart disease', 'heart health', 'junk food', 'meat', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity', 'omnivores', 'phytonutrients', 'plant protein', 'plant-based diets', 'prediabetes', 'protein', 'saturated fat', 'standard American diet', 'steak', 'vegans', 'vegetables', 'vegetarians', 'vitamin C']","Nutritional quality indices show plant-based diets are the healthiest, but do vegetarians and vegans reach the recommended daily intake of protein?","The only nutrient Americans may be more deficient in than fiber is potassium.

When I explain how misleading some of these studies are to my friends and family they are surprised and outraged. “How will we know what is true?”, they ask. Look deeper, do a little research. But, most people will just believe what they hear so these false, misleading claims can continue to work for the industries using these tactics. Having NutritionFacts.org as a resource to learn the facts is so valuable!Unfortunately most people do not have the time, nor (more importantly) the proper education and tool set necessary to evaluate research studies. This is what the people who fund the studies and make misleading statements count on!As one of my co-workers stated to me regarding the claim made on a recent study that “Beef Lowers Cholesterol” (which he left on my desk, and when asked, explained to him how the study was designed and flawed in their conclusions) — “You weren’t actually supposed to read the study.”http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bold-indeed-beef-lowers-cholesterol/The BOLD study is another excellent exampleNor do those who would like to read and analyze the studies have access to them past PubMed abstracts.So the vast majority of us are getting our info second-hand. Even here at our beloved NF.org. It often comes down to who you trust to filter your information for you.It’s amazing that Dr. Oz / Hyman / Lustig / Gary Taubes / WAPF get taken by such deceptive study claims. Don’t any of them look at the DATA?? Yet, they’ll scrutinize the raw data from the China Study to poke holes in it, or take the word of an English major who’s done so instead.Great world we live in.What do egg replacement products taste like?In baking, egg replacers (flax, chia, Ener-G, etc) typically have no flavor but just act as binders or leaven. In vegan dishes such as scrambles, omelets, “egg” salads, deviled “eggs” etc, tofu is usually used for the texture, along with turmeric for coloring and the Indian seasoning kala namak, a black salt (which is actually pink) for a sulfurous egg smell and flavor. Here’s a simple, tasty recipe from Cadry’s Kitchen for Vegan Breakfast Tofu Eggs that has links to more info about kala namak and a new product called Vegg (vegan egg yolk) that I haven’t tried: http://cadryskitchen.com/2014/02/16/vegan-breakfast-tofu-eggs/ Is this the sort of info you were curious about?Nope. I was more curious about the egg replacer they may have used in the study. Like the commercial Egg Beaters product?Laloofah: Nice link! Thanks for sharing that. I’m starting to experiment with the kala namak and am happy to get new ideas. Especially one so simple. Thanks!You’re very welcome, Thea! I make Cadry’s recipe w/o the oil, just dry-frying the tofu in my nonstick skillet. Works fine. Have fun with your kala namak, I love it in my tofu scramble, too.It looks like the “egg substitute” used in the study was the already separated egg whites you can buy in a carton.Right. That’s what I’m asking. Scramble up some Egg Beaters and what do they taste like? Close enough to the real thing to fool a subject/researcher in a RCT?It wasn’t double-blind, so fooling researchers wasn’t an issue. During the second phase of the trial, subjects consumed either “1/2 cup” of substitute or 2 hardboiled eggs, and there was a crossover phase, so they definitely knew they were getting something different. Dilation and lipid panel seems pretty objective though, so I’m not sure the lack of a perfect placebo is significant.It would have been interesting if they added some Vegg to the egg beaters though. :)K. So I’m still asking, from anyone who has personal experience with the product, what do commercial Egg Beaters look and taste like when prepared? :-)Well, you could buy some and try it yourself.That would defeat the purpose of asking in the first place: to learn from other’s mistakes and successes.I actually eat eggs once every 1-2 weeks, for me personally 2 eggs once every 1-2 weeks are okay, the rest of the time I am vegan WFPB diet. I had tried egg replacers in baking, and I found it not to my liking because of a slightly bitter aftertaste it has. So now when I make vegan baked goods, I use ground flaxseed mixed with water or puréed silken tofu to substitute for eggs. If I absolutely have to use eggs then I use egg whites only or mostly egg whites with 1-2 yolks.Before I went vegan, I ate a store-brand equivalent of Egg Beaters somewhat frequently. They taste just like conventional scrambled eggs. (But because they contain virtually no fat, they always stuck to my “nonstick” pans unless I added a generous amount of oil to the pan.)Thanks. That’s eggzacctly what I was wondering. :-)This video is my favorite of volume 18, it really shows how nutrition “authorities” can misconstrue the results of the studies and point to these to claim eggs are healthy. The researchers make it easy for them too with the misleading conclusions. This video, along with the abundance of others on nutritionfacts.org really puts the nail in the coffin for eggs.On that note, this particular podcast interview of Evelyn Kocur (aka @CarbSane) is worth a listen, even while disagreeing with her low carb diet choices.The Beginner’s Guide to Interpreting Health Researchhttp://evidencemag.com/health-research-podcast/Basically, the media headlines don’t always say what the data says, the study title doesn’t always say what the data says, the author’s conclusions don’t always say what the data says…and that’s before you even start to analyze the methodology. (:-/I really cannot believe that those researchers were able to do that study and write that article with a straight face. To call their conclusions “misleading” is being kind.Is that lead author DL Katz as in Yale/HuffPo’s David Katz, MD?Yes: http://youtu.be/guyQW6n3f6o?t=15m17sI’m definitely not against vegetarianism or for eating eggs, I’m all for eating the most healthy food. I just notice that most vegetarians have more visceral fat than they should eating so clean, and a “skinny fat” build. Dr. Greger for example has a belly, from things i have learned belly fat (visceral) increases the risk for hearth disease. Typically vegetarians don’t have an athletic build, lean and muscular. It seems from that perspective they are less healthy.“Typically vegetarians don’t have an athletic build, lean and muscular.”I think that typically most people, vegetarian, vegan, or not, will not have a muscular build unless they actively pursue activities to achieve that look. You can easily find many examples of lean and muscular vegans, as well as huge bulky muscular vegans, from ultra runners and ironmen competitors, bodybuilders and fitness models, to professional basketball/hockey/football/tennis players, olympians, etc.Personally I think trying to paint all vegans or vegetarians with a certain “look” is as silly as trying to paint all non-vegans as having a certain look/physique/body composition/etc. It would certainly be statistically reasonable for me to say that it seems like non-vegans have a rather overweight or obese look to them, judging from several I’ve seen. But wouldn’t that sound like an extraordinarily off-base observation and conclusion to you?Certainly the data is in on vegans and heart disease. Whether you think any particular vegan looks skinny fat or not, a skinny fat vegan has a significantly decreased risk of heart disease than a skinny fat non-vegan.So the pursuit of just being vegetarian will not keep you safe from heart disease if you still have the extra fat on your body (visceral fat). It seems that Dr. always says that the fat is the fat/cholesterol is the culprit. But some Vegans/ veggies still have to much visceral fat to be considered healthy even when they never eat fat or cholesterol. It makes no sense to me.You are working off an observation that vegetarians have more visceral fat, and then using that to form a hypothesis that this should put vegetarians at greater risk for heart disease. The problem with this hypothesis is two fold:1) Your observation is incorrect.A vegetarian diet results in greater visceral fat loss than a non-vegetarian diet:http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1464-5491.2010.03209.x/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3697401/Statistically, vegetarians are leaner than non-vegetarians.http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/5/791.longHowever you seem to believe that despite being leaner overall, vegetarians still have perhaps a higher proportion of visceral fat. If you have any evidence to back up this claim, please share. However, it seems that you are operating more on a basis of personal/selective/anecdotal observations.2) The second problem with your hypothesis is that it is already known that the predicted outcome disagrees with reality. We already know rates of heart disease in vegans and non-vegans. And the rates are better for vegans. We do not need to predict the rates of heart disease with different dietary regimes; we already know them. And it would not make very much sense to try to predict what is causing vegans to have more heart disease, when they have less.My point is: Eating no Cholesterol or Saturated fat does not automatically make you lean and healthy. Lean = healthy metabolism. Healthy metabolism = efficiently burning fat in blood. The point is you can have a healthy metabolism eating meats or veggies. Every one has different metabolism, some can eat as much cholesterol as they want and metabolize it. Some cannot, obviously. Broadly saying eggs or meats are bad or vegan-ism ect is good that is misleading. We are metabolically diverse in every way and that is why humans are still on the earth. Dr. is to biased toward his personal views. That’s all. Some can smoke 50 years and live to 100.“Broadly saying eggs or meats are bad or vegan-ism ect is good that is misleading”I know right? That would be like broadly saying cigarettes are bad or non-smoking is good. Why study anything? We’re all different.Some can but most cannot.You are only trying to make yourself feel better-nothing more… Eat what you want.Excessive calories result in an excessive BMI no matter what the source of calories. Excess weight tends to raise LDL and TG while lowering HDL. So excessive weight on anyone is a concern for all, especially central adiposity.Many vegans/vegetarians eat BK veggie burgers, fries, and Coke.… all vegetarian foods but not necessarily healthy. VegJUNKtarians are not exempt from heart disease.However, vegans (supplemented properly with Vit B12) still lower their risk for cardiovascular disease by not throwing more dietary saturated fat+cholesterol onto the fire, raising LDL even further than necessary.“Excessive calories result in an excessive BMI no matter what the source of calories.”This is simply untrue, depending on how you wish to define ‘excessive’. If you mean 100 calories of nuts vs 100 calories of meat then no, they are not equal. There are some foods you can eat a great deal of without getting fat and others you can’t, celery I’ve heard for instance may even have a negative calorie effect.Macsmileys point is still valid. 100 grams of celery and 100 grams of nuts do not have the same calories. I don’t think it is humanly possible to over consume celery calories anyway. If you overfeed on any macronutrient though it will lead to weight gain, so his point is still valid.I have to disagree since you’re misconstrued his point, his point was that a 100 calories is a 100 calories, no matter where it comes from, this is demonstrably untrue as different types of food stimulate different metabolic responses.Did you see my reply to you?http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-arterial-function/#comment-1628446515Toxins mistakenly focused on weight, not calories.The so-called negative calorie effect of celery is due to the alleged energy it takes for the body to process and digest it, i.e., chewing. That still does not negate the need to maintain energy balance to avoid weight gain. It confirms it.What it does mean is that the energy balance equation is not first grade math. For metabolic factors that go into the equation, in addition to Evelyn Kocur’s (@CarbSane) interview, see also the Calories Count interview of Stephan Guyanet:http://youtu.be/CqMB8luQERQ” That still does not negate the need to maintain energy balance to avoid weight gain. It confirms it.” A properly functioning body will do just that, maintain it’s own weight. You body and its metabolism make ongoing adjustments, if it didn’t even miniscule variations in energy in vs energy out would have huge consequences over time.I think you misinterpreted my post, I discussed calories specifically, but mentioned weight in relation to his post.Ill concede that different foods function differently metabolically, what I feel like you are implying is that calories don’t count for certain foods where as they do for others. If the latter statement is what you are saying, I would disagree.Obviously calories count, but they aren’t all equal. This is fairly illustrative Nuts and Obesity: The Weight of Evidence https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRxMhqdmb2YExcessive calories = calories in excess of the body’s energy needsThe difference between 100 calories of nuts or celery versus 100 calories of meat is how many calories end up digested and absorbed into the bloodstream. It’s not that the calories in nuts/celery have a different effect on the body per se, but that a good portion of those calories in the form of indigestible fiber end up in the toilet, and therefore they do not accurately get factored into the energy balance equation.This variable is addressed in this discussion between Sam Feltham and Evelyn Kocur. http://youtu.be/TwlPh7BM-8IPeople who eat a whole food plant based diet are leaner by a fair margin. How did you dream up this fat scenario of yours?“It seems from that perspective they are less healthy. ”A whole foods plant based diet simply prepared is from my perspective a healthier way to live. But many factors play into “health”. I have problems that this way of eating helps and makes me healthier to deal with problems that are not related to diet.Ever see Dr. Joel Fuhrman jump from the floor to the top of his desk?Joel Fuhrman: The Doctor Is Out Therehttp://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/joel-fuhrman-the-doctor-is-out-there-20121107This is an n=1 approach to things. The universe of vegetarians are not only the ones you have seen. I myself am a competitive rock climber and have only noticed strength gains from going plant based. Exercise increases muscle mass, not diet.and the average person looks good to you?it is all very confusing. A report I read recently say if you dont eat fish your chance of getting dementia is doubled.so all the vegen and vegetarians what do they have to say about that ?I’m tryin to think but nothin happensCiting the report, and giving a brief summary to show something of what you remember beside the conclusion you took away, would probably be good.Got data? Link to study on PubMed?I am assuming this is due to omega 3’s? Flax, walnuts and leefy greens are great sources for omega 3’s.Chia and hemp too, right?Yes, definitely.I always look for the funding source. You can weed out a lot of propaganda that way. As BD said years ago, “Money doesn’t talk, it swears.”How do studies like those end up in peer reviewed journals? The conclusions are so misleading that I’d consider them borderline criminal fraud.I like your informative videos, but don’t understand your war on eggs. Yes, I get what was put across in this video. I think, however, that we can find studies which fit our opinions. What about eggs having their own lecithin built in? And what about cholesterol being primarily a result of endogenous, not exogenous causes? What about high cholesterol and arterial blockage being a consequence of systemic inflammation? Eggs are a powerhouse of nutrients in a small package.You are the reason. Gregor thinks you are misinformed about eggs in particular and cites information for you in order to counter that. For that matter, I think you are likely misinformed, myself. The wishy-washy bit about it all being relative because we can find studies that superficially support our views is weak. Official recommendations caution to limit dietary cholesterol and if you want to have a different opinion from that you need to reason more closely.I am the reason for what? You did not address my questions.You didn’t back your objections with anything resembling hard studies, and you apparently appealed to the idea that studies can be used to support any view. Why should anyone pursue a close argument with you if you aren’t going to use the same close standard in developing the argument from your perspective?Eggxactly! The war is on ignorance. Eat all the little powerhouses you like Reuven. You can take it from me that after your first heart attack they turn into big fat smart pills.I eat 3-6 eggs a week and my cholesterol is perfectly fine. Are you familiar with Dr. Roger Williams?Perfectly fine being what exactly? Normal cholesterol is not exactly “normal”. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-target-cholesterol/Within normal lab ranges. What is the hysteria about eating a few eggs per week? I had a patient with blood so thick and full of lipids and they lived into their 80s! That’s an exception but it points out the importance of biochemical individuality and that it is very possible for someone to live a long life with no restrictions in their activities, even with such high blood fats. Frankly I scratch my head over the extreme nature of her case. I would like to hear from someone on this thread the acknowledgement that cholesterol is a critical molecule in the body, so important for so many functions, made by nearly every cell, and that low cholesterol is a far higher problem than high. I would also like to hear from someone that inflammation and white sugar are the true problems we all face today. Biomarkers of inflammation are where we should be looking!!! Stop making a war on individual foods. We’ve been through it all already going around in circles. Protein is good. Now its’ bad. We were wrong, it’s really good. Etc. All whole foods are good. Too much or too little of anything is not good. Inflammation and environmental toxins are the true problem.Low cholesterol through dietary means is not an issue. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/can-cholesterol-be-too-low/Eggs are inflammatory just as this video demonstrates along with others http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/In addition to the the inflammatory effects of animal based foods http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/endotoxemia/For the record, let me also point out that I edited the post to which you are replying for clarity shortly after posting it, but you may not have seen the final version before posting. I apologize for that.Hello Reuven, the nutrients in eggs are of little concern as they are way more abundant elsewhere.Eggs are considered good sources of lutein and omega 3 as well as an excellent source of protein. For these reasons, they are considered health foods. Looking at these claims in detail, chickens have lutein due to the fact that they have a varietized feed, these nutrients are not inherent of eggs. Based on the nutrient data found on the USDA database, 10 grams of spinach has approximately 12 times more lutein then 10 grams of an egg. We cannot really consider eggs an appropriate source of this nutrient.https://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR25/nutrlist/sr25a338.pdfRegarding Omega 3, current levels of omega 3 in eggs are highly inadequate and one must consume around 30 eggs to reach an acceptable level of omega 3 for the day. A male needs around 1.6 grams of omega 3 per day, a female needs around 1.1 grams a day. A large egg contains about .037 grams of omega 3. Omega 3 in the ALA form processes to EPA which is also processed to DHA. These fats areanti-inflammatory. Omega 6 processes down to arachadonic acid which is highly inflammatory. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/“What about high cholesterol and arterial blockage being a consequence of systemic inflammation?”This video demonstrates that eggs causes systemic inflammation in addition to the high intake of arachidonic acid.“And what about cholesterol being primarily a result of endogenous, not exogenous causes?”“Serum cholesterol concentration is clearly increased by added dietary cholesterol but the magnitude of predicted change is modulated by baseline dietary cholesterol. The greatest response is expected when baseline dietary cholesterol is near zero, while little, if any, measurable change would be ex…pectedonce baseline dietary cholesterol was >400-500 mg/d. People desiring maximal reduction of serum cholesterol by dietary means may have to reduce their dietary cholesterol to minimal levels (http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/55/6/1060.full.pdfThis is the kind of stuff I think would be great in a faq section! Especially the baseline cholesterol bit. Actually, especially all of it. :)“I think, however, that we can find studies which fit our opinions”You missed something here. Did you watch the video? Greger took the major studies egg proponents use to back up their own opinions, which are funded by the egg industry, which explicitly and incorrectly conclude that eggs are non-detrimental, and he simply presented their own data and methodological details in a more honest light to show the erroneous and ethically questionable nature of their conclusions.In all of the lay-media coverage on eggs being beneficial or non-harmful, I have not once seen the caveat of “… as a sausage egg mcmuffin”.It’s not a war on eggs, it’s simply a war on misinformation, as others have said. All he’s doing is giving you information. Take it in, process it, then do what you want with it. Acquisition of knowledge should not induce a defensive response.Hi Reuven,With respect, this should unruffle your feathers: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15640512As for eggs being a ‘powerhouse of nutrients,’ I’m just not seeing it: http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/dairy-and-egg-products/111/2 And, at 63% of calories from fat and 35% animal protein, it seems like a very rich food that should be taken infrequently if so desired.Finally, one can get as much choline present in one large egg by eating two cups of broccoli, a much better choice imo: http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/othernuts/choline/Have a great day and keep coming back!I looked up eggs on the ANDI score list, a ranking of foods based on nutrient density. The only foods that receive a perfect 1000 score are leafy greens like kale and watercress. Berries will give anything from a 200-300 score, but eggs are only a measly 31. Bananas are a 30, but when you consider all the baggage that eggs bring to the table, bananas at 30 are a much better option. So I don’t get why people think eggs are a nutritional powerhouse. Are bananas a nutritional powerhouse? No, but a few bananas a day is ok since they don’t have all that bad stuff in them.Ben: I’m not familiar with the ANDI score, but I’m going to look it up. Your post fascinated me. Thanks so much for taking the time to make this post.here is an ANDI score list: http://thechalkboardmag.com/get-dense-why-you-should-be-eating-foods-with-high-andi-scoresOn this list eggs are a 34, still not a nutrition powerhouse. But berries are lower then I remembered, they are from 130-200. Cranberries are the highest at 207 but they are not ranked on this list. They are on this list: http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/healthy-eating/andi-guideBen: Thanks for that post! It’s really interesting to me. Of course, the devil is in the details in terms of how those numbers are generated, but I still find it very interesting. Thanks!Dr. Greger you have changed my life completely! You truly are the most caring and selfLESS person i’ve ever come across! Dr. Greger you literally given me YEARS of healthy life that i most likely wouldn’t have had had I not watched your videos and learned how much diet truly affects your life! I probably would have dropped dead of a heart attack in my 50’s had it not been for you!(Quoting batman begins) “Some men just wan’t to see the world burn” well Dr. Greger just wants to see the world LEARN. an amazing man he truely is!I second your enthusiastic praise of Dr. Greger, Ryan. How fortunate we are to know his work! It hurst when I read nasty criticisms of this selfless and very funny man who can bring alive so much nutritional and political information for so many. I love his voice, style, and courage. I hope he will have more Hang Outs whiling on the treadmill. That was fun.Gayle: I agree with you. I’m often baffled by the pettiness out there. I can only believe that it stems from a deep rooted fear that Dr. Greger is right, and someone might actually have to change if they want to be healthy. Their unconscious is saying, “better to just shoot the messenger.” I too have a fun time seeing the videos. Thanks for your post!Thea: I am a psychologist who studies dreams and problem solving. I hear many dreams about nutrition and my impression is that getting between an eater and his addiction is like getting between a mother bear and …!Gayle: Your work sounds absolutely fascinating.And I have to say, the end of your post made me smile big! ;-)Ryan: I think that Dr. Greger tries to read as many of the comments that he can. While I don’t speak for Dr. Greger, I’m sure he really appreciated your post. And speaking for myself – me too! Thanks for posting and for giving me a fun batman quote that I didn’t know. :-)COFFEE BOOSTED? while we are nearly 100% nutritarian and follow Dr. Gregger’s advice very closely, we do drink one or two cups of medium roast coffee a day. But here is how we make it better: 8 oz of coffee dripped through paper, ½ to one tsp. of a mix of equal parts of turmeric, (with dash of pepper), ginger, cardamom, 2 parts cinnamon from Ceylon, 8 oz of unsweetened soy milk, Truvia ( 50* erythritol) or erythritol to taste, all buzzed with a frother to keep a good part of the spices in suspension, and then microwaved. DELICIOUS!Thanks, I’ll give it a try. One thing I don’t like is a lot of cardamon, though, I’ll have to just do a pinch.Over time, we have come to enjoy more and more spices. I used to be very cloves and cardamom shy. Kevin has always been able to enjoy almost anything we have tried from Drs. Fuhrman and Egger. I have been amazed at my conservatism in taste. But with practice, I become a progressive.P.S. I mix all those spices and funnel them into one spice shaker. Saves lots of opening and closing.Just curious. How many eggs do the lacto-ovo Seventh Day Adventists centenarians eat on average?I’m into fitness and bodybuilding and have been eating a plant based vegan diet for almost a month now and love it plan to stay this way! I was just wondering what about ‘Ajipure vegan branch chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine will they help build muscle? and are they bad for you?Hi Eric,Welcome to the wonderful world of Whole Food Plant-Based (WFPB) living! Regarding your questions about taking isolated amino acids, I am writing to emphasize the ‘Whole Food’ portion of WFPB diets. Just shooting from the hip here, have a look at a whole food like black turtle beans: http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4283/2I mean, really look at all you are getting from this bean that Dr. Gregor shows us to be The Best Bean: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-bean-2/Also, have a look at the amino acids present in one measly cup of cooked black beans: http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrientprofile&dbid=87All your amino acids of interest are in there in plentiful quantities, along with a wide range of nutrients that no supplement maker in their wildest dreams could ever stuff into a jar.And don’t forget about the fiber. Fiber is your BEST FRIEND!!! You won’t get any of it by eating amino acid supplements.Finally, there are websites devoted to vegan bodybuilding: http://www.veganbodybuilding.com/But, as you learn more about how to eat WFPB from Dr. Greger and other reputable sources, I suspect you will become a very savvy consumer of any wonder supplement these sites are promoting.Again, welcome to WFPB living and have a great workout!Eric, you probably already know this, but because you’re new to WFPB I wanted to be sure you are aware of the following. 1) You MUST obtain a reliable source of vitamin B12. Supplements are easiest to deal with imo; I take 5000 micrograms sublingual methylcobalamin once per week. Here’s a link to all of Dr. Greger’s B12 videos to get you started: http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=b122) You must be sure to get omega-3 essential fatty acids; two rounded tablespoons of GROUND flax seeds daily is what I do, and you can eat this stuff any way you like. Omega-6 EFA’s are plentiful in whole plant foods and so that is a non-issue. Here’s Dr. G’s wisdom: http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=flax3) Processed oils are not a whole food, and it is important to consider how much of this you plan to use going forward. I use canola spray on my waffle iron, but that’s all the processed oil I use. Most processed oils are loaded with omega-6 EFAs that will interfere with your body’s ability to convert the omega-3 EFAs obtained by eating ground flax seeds into EPA/DHA, which are the prized substances for optimal health. http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=oilAll the best and good luck!I have to admit I am frustrated when I see portions of the studies cited in these video clips, but am unable to access the full studies when I go to the links in the “Sources Cited” section because I don’t have access to the articles on the various professional journal sites. As much as I appreciate Dr. Greger creating and presenting these thought-provoking clips, I would like to read the original research papers rather than have them filtered for me. I am able to read enough of the articles by freezing the clips to see that Dr. Greger is often times slanting his remarks toward his overall emphasis on plant-based diets and not presenting the full evidence as it was originally printed. This is a result of the complexity of scientific research and reporting. It would take a clip 3-4X as long to present the material fully and that is just not feasible in our media focuses short news bit world. People would get tired of listening to all the scientific jargon that normally goes with any comprehensive presentation. MAYBE THE CLIPS COULD SHOW A LITTLE MORE OF THE ORIGINAL ARTICLES SO THAT THOSE OF US INTERESTED IN REVEIWING THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION COULD GET A FULLER LOOK AT THE RESEACH?What helps me is if I google the article title in quotes and after the last quote, put pdf. For example, “Article title” pdfI feel your pain.I’m sure Dr. Greger would love to show larger portions of the studies he cites, but I’m guessing that showing much more besides a small quote to make a point might be a copyright issue.Try looking for titles via Google Scholar. That may reveal a secondary source for a particular paper. Some studies are published in more than one publication.I know of one blogger who depends on copies of studies being donated to her by readers who have access to a medical library. But I’m not one of them.Humzee, do you happen to have access to a public university library? A university, particularly one with a good science/engineering program, will have subscriptions to most of these journals.Fwiw, I don’t think a bigger screenshot is going to make much of a difference. Whatever you think of Dr. Greger’s interpretation of the author’s prose, in order to decide if you even agree with the author’s interpretation and validity of their own data, you need the whole paper, especially the super fine print methods section, and that’s a section that is never going to be shown in the videos.Hi Humzee, I volunteer for Dr. Greger and have access to a medical library. If you (or anyone else reading this) want an article mentioned in Dr. G’s work, I’m happy to email it to you. Just cut and paste the link into an email to NFvolunteer@gmail.comAny plans to do any videos on this…http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/popular-fish-oil-study-deeply-flawed-new-research-says-1.2637702Good find, frankfurman.When he said the study was done by an Egg Board, at that point, I had no interest in their conclusions. Just like when coffee, wine, beer companies fund studies. They are performing many studies until they find one that shows something good and that is all you see published. Lately the avocado advocates are citing studies about the health benefits of avocados. But they don’t mention the fat in them.I saw Dr. Oz one day cite one cup of diced avocado as being “a surprisingly good source of protein”. Pitiful.You must always remember that the purpose of Dr. Ooze as with all television is to sell soap. Soap, insurance and toothpaste… and cars. Cars, soap, comfy chairs, insurance and toothpaste. and fluffy toilet paper (ftp). … Among the many products sold by Dr. Odz are …now for something completely different…I understand that. Unfortunately, people listen to him. His recommendations are gospel for some, even though he contradicts himself constantly. Makes me wonder who’s writing his script and lining up guests. Dr. Fuhrman on one day, “Grain Brain” Perlmutter the next.The REAL QUESTION IS NOT even about cholesterol and eggs at all. If we are REALLY concerned about cardiovascular health (and not pushing a vegetarian/vegan agenda) and what (micro/macro) nutrients and thus foods are helpful or harmful to this end, then you have to look at BIOMARKERS OF VALUE. The following links go into various aspects of this areahttp://biomarkers.cardiosource.org/Basics-of-Biomarkers…http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/113/19/2335.fullhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632595/…http://www.aacc.org/…/Docu…/EmergingCV_RiskFactors09.pdfhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/…/pii/S0009912013002750Only when you have a decent/reliable set of biomarkers that are effective in predicting CVD can you then move forward in designing a good study testing and then determining whether a given food/nutrient prevents or contributes to CVD.This study actually looks at a few of these useful biomarkers (adiponectin and CRP) and found that eggs were beneficial, though she was funded by the egg industry: http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/5/1/6#Or you can just floss more http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824149.Does cholesterol cause CV disease? http://vimeo.com/77730824http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feCpP40ZHqI#t=1h57mNearly 3 hours? Lawrence, c’mon, LOL! Please bottom line it for me. ;)Your post is part one of a two part program that has been removed from the ABC website for breach of it’s impartiality standards http://www.news.com.au/…/story-fneuz9ev-1226914999262.This program has been widely criticised.This is the first of a six part detailed discussion and critique of the information presented in this program.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc0fRxFcLHgEnjoy.Dave, thanks. I’m always interested in all sides of the issue. I’m in favor of the Mediterranean way of eating for most people. I think there are extremists on both ends.Devastating. Thank you, Dave.For the record, a few days ago I responded to one of Reuven’s posts, at which time the handle was ‘Reuven…’. But, today this handle has been changed to ‘Dr.Reuven…’ on all posts. Perhaps Dr. Rosenberg would be so kind as to share with the hundreds of thousands of people who visit this site his credentials. Thank you in advance, Dr. Rosenberg.Be alert Lawrence, you never know. One clever paleotroll we know has frequently used multiple aliases and personas -often after being banned, again- or being unable to keep them all straight – so you shouldn’t think there are more than just one of them.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePzJbllNCPgIt is a shame that the media gobbles up Industry spin the way they do. It happens on a nearly daily basis. The real shame is those working for Industry (PR firms, communications managers, etc.) will twist deadly things around to make them appear healthy. This has got to stop, but I don’t see our politicians having the guts, the will or the ability to stand up to Industry lobbyists and other pressures coming from the meat, egg and dairy industries.http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Yolks-Discover-reclaim-health-ebook/dp/B00IMJYWW8/ref=pd_ys_sf_s_154606011_a1_6_p?ie=UTF8&refRID=0PVYBGZJR3QTDMTWKBVPYou should know better than others that books are hardly sources of good information, especially when the author has the full capability of misconstruing the data. A great example of this is wheat belly and the blood type diet.Hey Toxins, Dr. Garth Davis (plant based weight loss surgeon) had a great facebook post the other day on carbs vs. fats in the wake of Fed Up:So I post a picture of a vessel loaded with fat [atherosclerotic artery] and tell people to use common sense. I then get a bunch of responses trying to teach me physiology, even though that is my expertise. The fact that I actually go to the meetings where this is discussed and debated, the fact that I actually study the journal articles, the fact that I actually treat patients and have for 12 years, seems to not matter much to some people. So lets get scientific. And this is just the tip of the iceberg.What matters when you eat is your post meal state. This is far more important than baseline fasting lipid values. A key study was done by Vogel who measured vessel response via duplex sonography after fatty and non fatty meals. AFter a fatty meal there is measurable vasoconstriction. The effect is like putting your finger over a hose. The velocity of the blood increases causes sheer force. He also showed that after a high fat meal the blood was loaded with fat, some of it is oxidized LDL which is exactly what you see in the picture from yesterday. Vogel, R. A., et al. (1997). “Effect of a single high-fat meal on endothelial function in healthy subjects.” Am J Cardiol 79(3): 350-354.Now I certainly don’t think added sugar is good for you. Excess calories will create fat. Problem is that sugar itself, in a single meal, is not inflammatory at all, but fat is extremely inflammatory provoking. This study feed people juices vs cream and the difference in inflammation is dramatic. Deopurkar, R., et al. (2010). “Differential effects of cream, glucose, and orange juice on inflammation, endotoxin, and the expression of Toll-like receptor-4 and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3.” Diabetes Care 33(5): 991-997.So you have a state after a fatty meal where you are inducing flow changes and inflammation and increasing lipids!!!! Meanwhile, sugar does not create any of these issues. Sørensen, L. B., et al. (2005). “Effect of sucrose on inflammatory markers in overweight humans.” Am J Clin Nutr 82(2): 421-427.There has never been an animal model of atherosclerosis created with feeding carbs but many with feeding saturated fat. Population studies from EPIC, to ADVENTIST, to FRamingham, to so many others show definite relationship between high saturated fat and heart disease.Chew on this. The National Geographic Blue Zone study found places where people had exceptional longevity. None of these places eat a high fat diet. They eat MAINLY CARBS. The Okinawans live long healthy lives eating yams and rice. If carbs ae so bad why are they so healthy. You may say processed carbs are different and they are in that they lack fiber. Otherwise though, sugar is sugar.There are NO long living high fat consuming people. None. Please do not say the Inuits. They live to 50 at best and actually do have heart disease. GJ, f. and V. B (2014). for the origins of the Eskimos and heart disease, facts or wishful thinking? A review. Canadian Journal of Cardiology. Of course people love to say the Masaii don’t have heart disease. That is because they die at 45-50 before their 1 st heart attack, but autopsy studies show they do have atherosclerosis.The bashing of sugar is backed by this belief that sugar causes insulin to rise and insulin is the real problem, so we should eat steak instead of bananas. Problem is that insulin rises higher after a steak than it does after a banana. A fatal flaw to the argument. Holt, S. H., et al. (1997). “An insulin index of foods: the insulin demand generated by 1000-kJ portions of common foods.” Am J Clin Nutr 66(5): 1264-1276.The fact is it is not as simple as fat or sugar. It is really a combination. You don’t usually just eat plain sugar. A doughnut has more calories from fat than sugar. Most sugars are combined with fat, so the insulin release cause the fat to be stored. Eat a banana and there is sugar but no fat to react to the insulin.The other absolute thing you have to understand is that active interventions aimed at reducing fat have actually reduced heart disease. THERE ARE NO STUDIES THAT SHOW INCREASING SATURATED FAT DECREASES HEART DISEASE. NONE!!! It is absolutely preposterous. Ornish showed that you can absolutely reverse heart disease with a low saturated fat diet. The North Karelia project showed that an organized government program to reduce saturated aft and cholesterol can work extremely well. Ornish, D., et al. (1998). “Intensive lifestyle changes for reversal of coronary heart disease.” JAMA 280(23): 2001-2007.I sit across from patients everyday review their diet logs. I operate on them and see their insides. I cut open vessels and clear out cholesterol plaques. You can choose to believe a blogger or a journalist or you can trust in science that has been around for a long time. You choose.DanielFaster: This is such a great article. It’s concise, cites references, and addresses people’s confusion. Perfect.Thanks for taking the time to post it! I really appreciate it.Thanks for the post! A nice summary all in one.Thank you for posting Daniel.What got me worried is the finding, that vegans have lower HDL levels, which can be because of e.g. “poor diet, especially if high in carbohydrates”.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712525Having a high HDL is not completely necessary necessaryA review examining 108 randomized control trials found this.“This systematic review and meta-regression analysis of 108 randomised controlled trials using lipid modifying interventions did not show an association between treatment mediated change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk ratios for coronary heart disease events, coronary heart disease deaths, or total deaths whenever change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol was taken into account. We found a statistically significant, substantial association between change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk ratios for coronary heart disease events, coronary heart disease deaths, or total deaths”“Our findings contribute to accumulating evidence that simply increasing the amount of circulating high density lipoprotein cholesterol does not necessarily confer cardiovascular benefits”They also note that HDL that is dysfunctional and pro inflammatory may be produced under certain dietary conditions, “recent data suggest that a low fat, high fibre diet, in combination with exercise, converts high density lipoprotein cholesterol from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state.”Conclusion: “Available data suggest that simply increasing the amount of circulating high density lipoprotein cholesterol does not reduce the risk of coronary heart disease events, coronary heart disease deaths, or total deaths. The results support reduction in low density lipoprotein cholesterol as the primary goal for lipid modifying interventions.”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645847/Thanks for the info.Could you please also comment on the following? http://authoritynutrition.com/7-ways-the-low-fat-diet-destroys-your-health/ It is based on several studies. Why I’m asking, 4 weeks ago I switched to a low fat vegan diet (whole foods) and feel like crap – weakness, fatigue, brain fog, very low mood, etc. My doctor insists that I should switch to high fat paleo-like diet instead…The article is incredibly flawed and assumes dietary norms that are untrue. In addition, the information is very skewed. Obviously this is a paleo website, it would misconstrue the data. nutritionfacts.org provides a more balanced point of view. Many would disagree that nutritionfacts.org is balanced, but because the evidence points towards a plant based diet does not mean that its biased in that way, its just what the science says.What constitutes your diet, is your diet based on nuts, or complex carbs? Do you consume flaxseed/walnuts? do you consume processed foods of any kind? a 24 hour, honesty dietary food recall is necessary to see if you are consuming adequate foods.OK, you asked for it :)First: I do not consume any fast food, sugar, processed food, low grade veg. oil, etc.Age: 42, height: 180 cm, weight: 72 kg.And here goes an honest 24 hour food recall (in order of appearance ;-):Breakfast: – 2 teaspoons of cocoa + 200 ml water + 300 ml organic oat drink (water + 10 percent oats); – 1 raw banana; – 1 teaspoon of organic virgin coconut oil (love it though its saturated :) – 1,5 tablespoons of flaxseed (crushed and added just before consuming); – 0,75 tablespoon of turmeric powder + 200 ml of water; – 1 apple.Lunch: – 1 red beet, boiled + 1 cucumber + 200 ml of kefir + green onion + 1 boiled potato (it’s our national cold soup – I’m from Lithuania); – 10-15 cherry tomatoes; – a cup of spinach + lettuce; – a cup of green tea.Dinner: – ~2 cups of boiled mung dalas beans (with some ginger, curry spices mix and onions sautéed in a table spoon o virgin olive oil); – 2 cups of greens: lettuce, baby spinach, ruccola; – a handful of walnuts and almonds; – a cup of green tea; – a little piece of black chocolate;Snack: – a cup of mint tea; – 1 apple; – a handful of frozen cherries.Supper: – 50 grams (dry) of organic rolled oats, boiled (love my oatmeal despite articles like: http://www.marksdailyapple.com/are-oats-healthy/#axzz337CyW4pg); – 1,5 tablespoons of flaxseed; – 1 banana and some goji berries (dried) added into the oatmeal; – 1 teaspoon of organic virgin coconut oil.That’s about it :)Oh, and supplements: 1 cap of vitamin D3 (800 IU of cholecalciferol), 1 cap of B group vitamins (milgamma (R): 40 mg benfothiamine (B1), 90 mg piroxidine hydrochloride (B6) and 0.25 mg cyancobalamine.Myself, I cannot find any evidence for benefits of meat and saturated fats, have been browsing medpub database for a week or so :) My academic background is not very far away from medical: I have a BSc in molecular biology, MSc in ecology and PhD in ecology/environmental sciences :) And my family doctor with his paleo meat/fat beliefs is telling me that humans evolved only after they started eating meat and my neurological symptoms are purely because of my vegan diet :(Ok, thanks. I put in your food intake into cronometer, an online nutrition program. Assuming what you gave me was accurate, the results are in the attached image below and are near estimations of your nutrient intake.Firstly, I want to tell you that you have a great omega 6:3 ratio, you are consuming plenty of fiber and it is good your diet is primarily based on plants.Secondly, I would like you to note that you are consuming trans fat on this diet and a copoius amount of saturated fat, in addition to total fat. This is mainly due to the kefir, and added oils. If you could eliminate these oils and animal products that would benefit you. I would keep the walnuts and flaxseed in your diet and almonds too.Third, oats are great for you, just make sure that it is not quick rolled oats (the kind that cooks in 1 min.). The reason is that it is very quickly absorbed which can cause a blood sugar spike, and I have heard a lot of anecdotal evidence from the community around me that they did not feel good after consuming quick oats. After I recommended switching to thick cut oats or regular rolled oats, they did not experience the unpleasant feeling, whether it be lethargy or poor mood.Major recommendations: I would continue eating your potatoes, and beans and begin eating thick cut oats, and experiment with adding a greater variety of vegetables such as red bell peppers, squash, mushrooms, etc. to your diet. Keep on with the salads as well. Eliminate all of the added oils, continue with the flax and nuts you already have been consuming, and eliminate the kefir. If you are looking for other starches to include in your diet, brown rice is another tasty and inexpensive option.I would up your intake of vitamin D to 2,000 IU’s per day after breakfast, and take 250-500 mcg’s of b12 daily, or 2,500-5,000 once a week. There is no need for the other B vitamins you are taking, you are getting plenty in your diet.If you are looking for a quality website of the same caliber as nutitionfacts.org that disseminates the fact from fiction regarding the paleo diet, I would go here. Plant positive is an excellent website. http://www.plantpositive.com/Thanks a lot for the insights. But which product contains trans fat in my diet??? The only added oils are virgin olive and coconut oil. Regarding oats, those are minimally processed, (15 minutes boiling time), though I boil them only for 5 minutes – I pour boiling water and soak them for a while before consuming.Kefir is the only animal source and contains trans fat. Good to hear about the oats. Free oils do not contribute to health but diminish it, so even the finest quality coconut or olive oil are still unhealthy. Oils are pure fat with no nutrition, its essentially a food extract.I think doing that will reduce your fat intake, and eating more starches and a variety of veggies will also help.Also, which program do you use for nutrient intake analysis? I tried cronometer.com for a short while, but somehow abandoned it :)Ouch, only now I noticed you’ve mentioned cronometer as well!!!And the study concludes that “ovo-lacto vegetarian diet may be more appropriate for premenopausal women.”Low HDL C again :(Compared with the Western diet, the Vegetarian diet was associated with lower homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (-1.12 mmol/L × mU/L; P=0.05) and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-4.77 mg/dL; P=0.09).http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24295929Dr. Greger – with regards to high fat diets, including egg consumption, there evidently a study from 1966 by NN Gupta at KG Medical College in Lucknow, India that purports that two ounces of onion eaten with/shortly after consuming a meal with 90% fat (butter, cream and eggs), was a powerful antidote to the ill effects associated with a high fat diet. My question is if you have seen this and/or other research that you can comment on. It seems to be an interesting claim, along with other tremendous health benefits of onions in lowering blood sugar, antibacterial, anti-cancer, etc. I found the reference in the book, “Left for Dead” (pg.145) by Dick Quinn, Thanks, Lee.LDL-C has been known for a long time a meaningless measure (as well as it’s impact on total cholesterol). It is LDL-P that matters. This video simply ignores this.I’m sorry to through my nativity into the discussion, but isn’t it true that only the egg yolk has cholesterol and it would be save to only use egg white?Naivenative: I know how much people want to be able to eat eggs, even if it is only the egg whites. And your theory that eating egg whites might be safe is perfectly understandable given the focus that is usually given on cholesterol without telling you the entire story. However, the whites are bad for you too. Here’s some info to get you started:Dr. Barnard talks about the problems that animal protein presents for kidney health. Other experts talk about the (strong in my opinion) link between animal protein and cancer. The question scientists then want to answer is: Is there a causal link? If so, what is the mechanism by which animal protein might cause cancer?If memory serves, Dr Campbell in The China Study mentions several ways in which we think that animal protein causes and promotes cancer. Here on NutritionFacts, you can get a great education on how animal protein is linked to the body’s over-production of a growth hormone called IGF-1. IGF-1 helps cancer to grow. To watch the series about IGF-1, click on the link below and then keep clicking the “next video” link on the button to the right until you get through the bodybuilding video. Then you will have seen the entire series. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/And Darryl recently reminded me about the methionine issue. Egg whites have *the* highest concentration of methionine of any food: http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-000084000000000000000.html?categories=1,18,9,0,13,14,5,4,42,16,17,15,6,3,2,11,7,19,21,12,10,8,22 Dr. Greger did a nice video showing the link between methionine and cancer. So, there are two clear pathways linking animal proteins, especially egg whites, to cancer. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/Darryl also pointed out that, “…high methionine diets increase coronary risk in humans. In its associations with cardiovascular disease and other disorders, homocysteine may be functioning partly as a marker for the major culprit, excess methionine.” http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475305001092And while I can’t find it right now, I believe that Toxins has pointed out two other health issues with egg whites.With all of the information we have about the harmful effects of animal protein in general and egg white in particular, I think it’s best to stay away from egg white. Why not get your protein from safe sources? Sources which are known to have lots of positive health effects and will naturally give you a balanced amount of protein? (ie: whole plant foods) Make sense?","['American Egg Board', 'breakfast', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cardiovascular health', 'cheese', 'cholesterol', 'eggs', 'fast food', 'fat', 'heart disease', 'heart health', 'industry influence', 'LDL cholesterol', 'McDonald’s', 'oatmeal', 'obesity', 'sausage', 'smoking', 'standard American diet']",Even studies funded by the American Egg Board show our arteries benefit from not eating eggs.,"More on the reaction to the Eggs vs. Cigarettes in Atherosclerosis study in my last video, Debunking Egg Industry Myths, as well as further discussion of the effects of the cholesterol in eggs on the cholesterol levels in the blood of egg consumers.

You hit on the idea in this video that without a double blind placebo controlled study, people are hesitant to trust the power of fruit and veg.It seems like this is a pattern in Medicine. Researchers only study what we can study easily, get funding to research, and get published. So our body of evidence doesn’t include the possibly powerful interventions that aren’t easily researched.You point out a significant issue. T. Colin Campbell discusses this problem in his book Whole.While RCTs are considered the “gold standard” of medical research, they really are not appropriate for all medical interventions. Surgery would be a good example. This is why large scale cohort studies, case-control studies and cross sectional studies are important and are often more suitable for studying diet and health.I teach a graduate level course in Epidemiology and a large portion of the course is focused on Evidence Based Medicine. I use the following Youtube video to introduce my students to the topic. It’s a bit long (55 min.) but if you’re interested in the subject I recommend watching it. If the link does not work, search Youtube for Teaching Evidence Based Medicine: Should We Be Teaching Information Mastery Instead.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w60YNt3deW4“large scale cohort studies, case-control studies and cross sectional studies are important and are often more suitable for studying diet and health.”Yes but we do have some high quality RCTs with hard endpoints such as PREDIMED and the Lyon Diet Heart Study, the Ornish Lifestyle Heart Trial, etc., so there is really no excuse (except perhaps for fundability). One of the largest nutritional RCTs was the WHI low fat diet trial, with more than 40,000 women followed for a number of years. The problem is that the various levels of evidence are not well understood by the public or even most practitioners, particularly the problem of lack of controls, lack of temporal associations in cross-sectional studies, treatment selection bias and hidden confounding, systematic measurement errors in dietary variables, etc.The problem is that very complex interventions are often not even subjected to RCTs, because people do not believe they are fundable or feasible. Large diet trials on record refute this notion.matt: That talk is SO powerful and SO well done. Thank you for posting that link!As much as I loved the talk and got a lot out of it, I was often nagged/concerned that not once did I hear the speaker mention the importance of the patient in the process–from the perspective of the importance of the patient’s ability to get the various information (in addition to the doctor), the ability for the patient to get into the details when the doctor is too busy/only has a minute, and the importance of the doctor recognizing that he/she is just participating in Team Patient. When desired, the patient must be allowed to be part of the weighing/applying of the information (speaker called it “wisdom”). I’m not wording it very well, but it seems to me that the speaker is missing a giant piece of the issue.But I didn’t actually disagree with anything he said. I sure hope that topic gets some more traction. Thanks again for posting the link.Wow thanks for posting this!I will have to take a look at that book, and your lecture. I got to ten minutes!I am a medical student in Missouri. In Medical School everyone is so focused on getting that “High Yield” information to get a good score on the board examination. Sometimes it is hard to get us to take the time to wrap our heads around untestable concepts.Understand that you don’t promote or endorse products – but there IS a product that is WHOLE FOOD (Not Extracts) in a capsule or chewable with 31 clinical studies – most double-blind, placebo-controlled – showing that these whole food capsules (I am carefully NOT mentioning the name) absolutely have health-giving effects, showing cellular change. Perhaps Dr. Greger, you could talk about the difference between products that have a NUTRITION label (meaning it is food) and products that have a SUPPLEMENT label – meaning…. who knows what’s in it? – as you recently pointed out.I applaud your amazing efforts. I have donated what little I could to support your work. I ask people all the time to sign up for your emails. And I help people improve their health by increasing the fruits, veggies, berries and grapes in powder form in a capsule with a NUTRITION label – which is not taxed in my state because it’s food!OK. I’ll name it. I also immediately thought of Juice Plus+ when I watched this video. In the past I had been skeptical about Juice Plus+ because it “fortifies” the food powders with antioxidant supplements like vitamins C and E, which I thought might be the “active ingredients”. I now discount that since this research shows these supplemental vitamin antioxidants are unlikely to have any clinical benefit. However, the variety issue, that is, the blend of a variety of fruits and vegetables in Juice Plus+ vs. the single food (tomato) used in this study is something I wish the study had tested.I’d be interested in seeing some live cultured whole food probiotics (nondairy yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, natto, kombucha, rejuvalac, etc) versus the probiotic supplements to treat allergies. They have used combinations of probiotic strains in supplements http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3784923/ and combinations are fairly regularly seen in live-cultured products, especially wild cultured sauerkraut etc.If you would have to devise a diet especially for asthma patients based on the scientific findings so far, would it be close to Eat to Live or would you make certain modifications? Show us your optimal diet plan for one day or week based on science!Borkent: I can’t personally answer your question about tweaking a diet for asthma, but I thought you might be interested in Dr. Greger’s “Optimal Nutrition Recommendations” based on his understanding of the science: http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/The NutritionFacts diet is similar to Eat To Live, but I believe has some differences. For example, you will notice that Dr. Greger’s optimal recommendations do not include any animal products. Dr. Fuhrman allows as much as 10% of calories from animal products in his long term optimal diet. Also, Dr. Fuhrman has some issues with “starchy” vegetables and whole grains where as Dr. Greger does not as far as I know.Hope that helps.I am certainly interested in this. I follow a combination of The Starch Solution + Eat to Live, which is a vegan nutritarian (G-BOMBS) approach supplemented with starches other than beans such as whole grains and potatoes, according to my appetite and activities. Fuhrman has lowered his upper limit of animal products to 5% in his new book The End of Dieting, btw, but I eat 0%. Fuhrman doesn’t say 5 or 10% is optimal. Lower is optimal. I do still have asthma complaints almost 3 years on this diet, it’s the reason why I asked. Thanks.Borkent: Best of luck with your asthma issues. One thing I have noticed on NutritionFacts is that while diet does a WHOLE lot to help a whole bunch of people with a wide range of problems, it definitely is not a magic pill. Personally, while I’m committed to a whole plant food based diet free of all animal products and limiting processed food, I too have found that some of my health problems remain. But I’m convinced enough by the evidence to know that I would be in worse shape if I did anything else.It seems to me that you are doing really great with your diet. I’m a big fan of Dr. McDougall too and love the Start Solution. Hopefully someone else can jump in with ideas about tweaking a diet specifically for asthma issues.Good luck!PolyPhenols are also closely related to salicylates in fruits and vegetables. It is well known that salicylates can play a role in ADHD symptoms and athsma/allergies as not everyone can tolerate these foods. Tomatoes are one of the big culprits… I have found through my own self study that eliminating grains during allergy season reduce my symptoms more than adding vegetables ever did… and I was eating 7+ servings a day. Seems to make sense as I’m allergic to grass/trees/weeds and grains seem to be closely related… Are there any studies that look at grain intake and allergies?Right on. A nice lady in my house suffers from salicylate sensitivity. (took many years to find a good Dr. to figure out). I really struggle to cook up meals that don’t cause her reaction, as in patiently suffocating until the trachea decides to relax again. We found some partial lists of salicylate content. Grains always seem to be high.http://salicylatesensitivity.com/about/food-guide/grains/for most people salicylates are probably a good thing because they bring the anti-inflam properties of aspirin. But for a small segment they are misery. Of course our individual problems don’t mean others should stay away from polyphenolics…but if you are bewildered at your reactions to fruits/veg/grains/spices…consider DieselPower’s words.Even better definitely cure asthma and similar with Gesret method and eat vegtan with a lot of whole fruits and vegetables for overall health~http://www.asthma-reality.com/anglais.htmWhole foods are the way to go, no discussion about that. But scientifically, this comparison of a supplement with a whole food is quite ridiculous. Lycomato is mainly lycopene, that’s it. A tomato is more than that. So, if lycopene is not the active substance in this study, the results just say nothing at all. If you would want to compare a whole food with an extract, you would basically first work out which compound(s) are responsible for the effect on astma, then put these chemicals (extracts or synthetics) into a capsule and do the study.Whole food vs. supplement. Many vegans, myself included, take a vitamin B12 supplement. Given how many studies show that supplements don’t do the job that whole foods do, should I be eating dirt (reportedly an excellent source of B-12)? How effective is our B-12 supplementation? Can we conclude it works simply by blood level and lack of symptoms indicating insufficiency?b-12 is more easily absorbed as a synthetic due to not needing intrinsic factor. a general claim of whole foods being better than supplements is not scientifically supported.The truth and science are obvious… whole, fresh, organic, high-grade, new, and alive…….again alive foods are most healthy.Inside those pills are dead…DEAD and not fresh and not alive.As someone who has asthma, thank you for these videos!!!! I have heard before that apples specifically are good for lung function! So awesome! “An apple a day”………………….. ;)Since 1993 severe hazel pollen asthma – up to 150 ! mg oral prednisolone, than 0.2 budesonide b.i.d., vegan since 2007. 2012 I switched to polyphenol rich diet (dark colored fruits & vegetables, herbal teas). From 2013 to today all symptoms are completely gone, although I stopped budesonide in 2012.Wow! I am so happy that some one actually is speaking up. This video is very informative. Sadly we live in a word on wish pharmaceuticals companies think they know everything. Don’t get me wrong, Pharmaceuticals do help, but they should stick to what they do best.Salsa two ways:Dance the Night Away-3-4 ripe tomatoes, diced -5 cloves garlic, minced -½ onion, diced -1 tbsp Holy basil -black pepperCombine all ingredients in a bowl and stir.

Don’t they contain phytates, as well?From what I can gather, paleo can be pretty much whatever a person wants it to be, aside from eschewing beans and grains, which seems to be pretty constant across the board. Some eat dairy, some don’t. Some eat tubers, some don’t. Some eat nuts and/or seeds, some don’t.What I find kind of hilarious are the “paleo” recipes like breads or pies made out of coconut oil or grassfed butter, coconut flour, almond flour, etc. Just enormously concentrated and entirely “unnatural” foods, but hey if it doesn’t have grains or beans in it, it must be healthy right?They evidently make it up as they go alongSome paleos like the Jaminet Perfect Health Diet assert all seeds are trying to kill us, so they also discourage those. And the presence of the allegedly antinutrient phytate is one of the reasons given.“all seeds are trying to kill us” gave me an amusing little image in my mind :DWoody Allen trying to get out with an axe while screaming “I don’t want to die!!!” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGj1smf-_vcAnnoyed, are you kidding? Come on. We have a natural and God given ability to think for ourselves. You can’t lay the onus of maintaining our personal health onto others. Take some additional time, do some research to test the truth and veracity of your informational resources by conducting your own comparative analysis. In so doing, you may just find that this particular site is among the most reliable you’ll ever find. Doc Greger isn’t responsible for your health anymore than a polar ice cap is. You should, however, come to the truthful resolve that the good doc’s site is objective and quite informative. But, then, before you noticed that you’d have to notice that he leaves the final analysis to those who are taking the time to visit his site. Ugh.Okay, I’ve looked into this a bit and here’s what I’ve learned (via “Mark’s Daily Apple”):Nuts and seeds contain phytate, which is bad, and grains contain phytate, which is bad, but according to MDA, it would be easier to overeat phytate in the form of grains than it would be to overeat it from nuts and seeds. Thus, nuts/seeds = okay; grains = evil.He gives the example of a certain amount of phytate being found in 362 Cal of brown rice, while the same amount would require the consumption of 575 Cal of almonds. His claim is that you could eat all that brown rice and still easily go back for seconds, while it would be much harder to eat 570 Cal of almonds.My opinion: are you kidding me?!? How many people eat almost two cups of rice with their meal and go back for seconds?575 Cal of almonds would be about 80 almonds, or 3.5 one-ounce servings. Personally I could very easily see someone eating a few servings of nuts as opposed to only one. Many people consider eating only one serving of nuts to be a supreme exercise in self control.So it’s not the most sound logic. He explicitly advocates that it’s fine to consume a small handful of nuts (about 2 oz according to him) per day, which equates to 362 Cal, yet for some reason it’s absolutely forbidden to consume the phytic acid equivalent of 228 Cal of brown rice, which would be a generous, slightly greater than one cup serving. Gee, unsound logic from a paleo guru, what will we hear next. ;)Another, absolutely hilariously entertaining find in my paleo sleuthing, is that many paleos, get this, drumroll please…..take IP6 supplements! Seriously people, you can’t make this stuff up! :D For some reason it’s magically better because you can take it on an empty stomach, so it can enter the bloodstream, and bind up minerals (apparently the intentional chelation of iron in the paleo world is a real concern), whereas if you take it with food, it’ll bind up the minerals in the food, and for some completely unsubstantiated and baseless reason, this is much worse.b00mer: Such a fun read! I love how you put it all into perspective. Really nice.ThanksBroscience, LOL. +1 for making me smile!Antinutrients are for the most part inactive with cooking. Not a study exists showing harmed health from bean consumption.I’ve seen IP-6 sold in health food stores. Is there any benefit it taking that, particularly for people who avoid eating beans?Hi jacque, it does look like there are in vivo studies to support IP6 as a chemotherapeutive agent (I did just a very quick search), though there is definitely a precedent to postulate that getting a particular nutrient from the whole food source is often preferable.However, you say you don’t eat beans. Does that include all legumes, like lentils or peas? If you don’t eat those either, you could still obtain phytate from whole grains or nuts/seeds if you consume those. I personally wouldn’t worry about supplementing if you consume an otherwise varied and balanced whole foods plant based diet.Try seeds & nuts.Soy protein isolate seems to go well with sunflower seeds. Throw together with some veggies and blend. Good stuff! Maybe that sits better than beans in general.Be weary of soy protein isolates, I don’t have the study on hand but soy protein isolates increase IGF-1 production twice as much as dairy.I like being a big boy Toxins.Eating whole plant foods as you suggest is definitely the route to go to build muscle and strength. The issue with IGF-1, in case you are not aware, is that it is a strong promoter of cancer growth. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-intake-and-igf-1-production/I’ll roll the dice on that one. As for now I keep suffering from stress and anxiety senstivities even though I’m on the mend.At 17 after passing 110 kg some kind of alpha male hormone state came over me and my friend.That state is extremely calming to the mind. It makes you utterly fearless. That is what I need for a while after 5 years of terror. It will hand me the tools to start EMDR and other therapies.Calmness vs stress and andrenergic reactions with its vasoconstriction is very bad for cancer too. I am in the process of trading one for the other I’m aware. But general health is spectacularly different. For now I’m better off.Might cancer be diagnosed or therapie done I’ll dose less. Reaching 100 kg I’ll go from 120 gr to 80 see what happens then to 40 gr I guess just for the reason you mentioned.If soy is your preferred protein for a larger physique, why not go with tofu and tempeh, traditional sources?I put myself on a 50 gr a day natto regime for now after finding out its bloodvessel clearing capabillities.The loss of sensation in extremities was a dead giveaway of plaque buildup during the first 10 days after stopping smoking.Goal number 1 by miles for the first year of food intervention is blood vessel support.Although I’m feeling better than I have in years (after 3 months with vegan days) its only an effect of less inflammation and better endothelial function. The disease is still there, and needs to be treated for another 8 months at the very least. (5 days vegan a week @1 kg+ of veggies + 50gr natto daily + daily exercise) I do not feel sick physically but I know I actually am, and very much so.As it is I cannot afford to get a food sensitivity towards soy, otherwise the natto is off the table. And I actually really like the earthy taste it add to my smoothies :) So whole soy bean intake I intend to keep limited.Maybe try lentils again in a month or so see if the reaction is milder, they are a great tasting bean.I’m guessing because those traditional sources do not raise IGF-1 as effectively as Isolate.Arjan you are a big guy! How tall are you? 6’5″?Also be weary of GMO found in most soy productsFor more information on avoiding GMO foods you can go to the Institute for Responsible Technologies website,http://www.responsibletechnology.org/ and look at their shopping guide.Are beans in the category of foods we can make “unlimited” use of? Or is there a concern about possibly getting too much protein?Thank you so much.Your intestines can have a rough time with beans. Try upping dose slowly. You can get very ill if you take more than you can handle. When you start getting loads gas and such, lower intake a bit or prepare to get uncomfortable.Antinutrients, such as lectins are inactive when cooked. Beans are one of the healthiest foods you can eat, no need to limit your amount. http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/11/why-you-should-eat-more-beans/Great for you if you are not sensitive to them. I personally am. And not all is destroyed, all the time.I remember a greger vid where it was claimed to be responsible for 10% of all food poisonings.Seems clear to me beans need monitoring. And certainly not something to be advised can be consumed without limits to a novice bean eater.Arjan, I also have allergies and food intolerances, and know that sometimes foods that are good for most people are not good for me. Tomatoes, for example; good for most, but they are not good for me. I need to check any food for how my body responds to it. I think the most I can do on a site like this is understand the general advantages and disadvantages of particular foods, and then see if the good foods agree with my body.Thank you for your perspectives on eating legumes. Am even cooking a batch of lentils right now.Slow increase is prudent advice for many. However…It’s not the lectins (paleo/broscience) that cause distress. It’s the lack of gut bacteria from a lifetime of not eating legumes which causes gaseous distress from a sudden large increase in bean consumption.Slow and steady wins the race.Beans, although high in protein, are also very high in complex carbohydrates. I consider them part veggie, part “grain”. Eat in plenty, as no studies indicate elevated IGF-1 from bean consumption.Does this mean that spouted beans have less healthful effects rather than more?This question seems to be popping up a lot lately; it would be good to get Dr Greger’s input.Many people seem to have this belief that soaking or sprouting eliminates all phytates. It doesn’t, it simply reduces so-called anti-nutrients. Sprouting has the additional benefit of amplifying antioxidant properties. Seeing as you will still be consuming some amounts of phytates from cooked sprouted beans, I’d assume that there are still great benefits from sprouting – you’ll be getting benefits from sprouting as well as benefits from phytates. Additionally, on a whole foods plant based diet, phytates are abundant from a variety of food sources; likely a tablespoon of flax seeds or a Brazil nut will give sufficient amounts of phytates for a healthy body, not to mention the phytates present in grains. If you want to maximize phytates, then you’ll want to avoid soaking or sprouting, though I don’t think abstaining from sprouting is justified if one is already in the habit to do so. No recommendations have yet been established as to how much phytic acid one should consume in their diet.I wonder if those women in the trial ever got any better with their cancer on the IP6 supplement? And whether or not it actually helped with the cancer, I wonder why the researchers didn’t just use natural sources of the compound?Dr. Gerger, A general question regarding turning Vegan: I am a naturally skinny 55yrs old guy at 5’7″ 120lbs and generally healthy. After a month of being strictly vegan, my Ketones level shot up to 2 (from the normal below-0) and I lost 2lbs of my weight, as well as felt weak physically. Turns out that in spite of loading up on mountains of Vegan foods, pasta, breads, nuts, I was getting only 1200 calories per day and my body started digesting its own tissues to compensate. To save my ‘life’ – I immediately switched back to eating ‘everything’, meat, dairy, eggs, poultry, and within 3 days my Ketone levels normalized. My weight was back to normal (120) within 10 days and I felt stronger. Although I now eat much more in veggies and fruit, I am weary about going all vegan again unless I know it’s safe for me. What will I need to include in my vegan diet to make sure I don’t starve my body? (i.e. get the calories I need)Dr. Greger,Will you comment in a future blog about the recent paper that reports that saturated fat doesn’t contribute to cardiovascular disease? I understand that saturated fat from animals comes along with carnitine which we know is damaging to the vascular system. My second question is that I avoid coconut because of the saturated fat. If I can live with the calories that come along with the saturated fats is there still a reason to avoid coconut in light of this report from Harvard?Thanks, DavidPlantPositive produced a brief response to those recent articles:http://www.plantpositive.com/blog/2014/3/23/recent-articles-by-drs-chowdhury-and-dinicolantonio.htmlDavid Katz also produced a response ( I’m wary of citing him since he has been caught performing studies/research to fit a preconceived conclusion. See 15:17 of the video I link after his article) :http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-katz-md/diet-and-nutrition_b_4985323.htmlhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guyQW6n3f6oFirst thing I noticed in the abstract:“Limitation: Potential biases from preferential publication and selective reporting.”March 24 2014: “Scientists Fix Errors in Controversial Paper About Saturated Fats”Willett says correcting the paper isn’t enough. “It is good that they fixed it for the record, but it has caused massive confusion and the public hasn’t heard about the correction.” The paper should be withdrawn, he argues.”“It’s dangerous.” http://bit.ly/1jxyIJvAlso: Dr. McDougall response: http://on.fb.me/1iOfvEZ.The study published in The Annals of Internal Medicine entitled: Association of Dietary, Circulating and Supplement Fatty Acids With Coronary Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis’ suggests that the type and quantity of dietary fat may not be important factors in coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. The mainstream media jumped on this study because, as Dr. John McDougall often says, “People love to hear good news about their bad habits”.This study once again demonstrates the folly of taking a reductionist approach to nutrition research. As T. Colin Campbell writes:“Reductionism by definition seeks to eliminate all “confounding” factors: any variables that might influence the outcome in addition to the main substance under investigation. But because nutrition is a wholistic phenomenon, it simply doesn’t make any sense to study it as if it were a single variable. Studying nutrition as if it were a single-function pill disregards its complex interactions.”Dr. Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health states:“The single macronutrient approach is outdated; I think future dietary guidelines will put more and more emphasis on real food rather than giving an absolute upper limit or cutoff point for certain macronutrients.”The reductionist mindset of many nutritional scientists has caused the decades-long confused haze that afflicts people who seek to discover the healthiest human diet. Continued focus on single nutrients and single outcomes will result in current and future generations to continue to wallow in the nutrition research mire.We must start treating nutrition as a wholistic phenomenon. and stop trying to tease out one contribution from a diet and ignore the rest. As Dr. Campbell says:“Of course body fat, dietary fat, education level, depression, socioeconomic standing, and so many more characteristics are interrelated and interactive with one another and with our bodies’ systems. While statistical adjustments can pretend to wrap up reality into neat little packages, they don’t explain the underlying reality at all. “The Cambridge University meta analysis looked at studies that compared bad diets with bad diets and attempted to tease out the contribution of specific components from the bad diets. It’s a pretty safe bet that folks who ate fewer animal foods (less saturated fat) probably ate more processed junk and vegetable oils. It’s no wonder that researchers didn’t find a significant difference between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.We need to emphasize studies that compare diets and assess multiple health outcomes. There is no shortage of these studies.Dr. Campbell’s work in China compared plant based diets with very plant based diets in people who were eating WHOLE and minimally processed plant foods. He found as animal food intake increased, so did the prevalence of many chronic diseases, including heart disease.Research led by Dr. Dean Ornish, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. and The Nathan Pritikin Research Foundation show that their diets protect against and REVERSE CAD, and other chronic diseases!Their research confirms wholistic research that points to whole food plant based (WFPB) diets as disease preventing and health promoting. Wholistic research includes:Ecological studies – survey and compare populations as they already exist, and see what they eat and how healthy they areBiomimickry – look at our nearest animal relatives—gorillas and chimps—and see what they eatEvolutionary Biology – examine our physiology and determine what our bodies have evolved to ingest and processReductionist scientists completely disregard wholistic evidence that can teach people the ideal human diet. The truth is available for all to see. All you have to do is open your eyes and activate your mind.I’ll finish with Dr. Campbell’s eloquent statement:“You can’t study wholistic phenomena solely through reductionist modes of inquiry without sacrificing reality, and truth, in the process”.I would like to see research about the capacity of the body to expell fatty wastes through higher fiber intake. Which must help in preventing reuptake.Hi there. I am wondering if you might want to look at vegan athlete eating plan/pattern. They are thriving and must eat a higher amount of daily calories. I don’t think loading up on pasta bread and nuts is best solution.For one consider: Brendan Brazier (http://www.brendanbrazier.com/). He has really well done site/program free – you can tailor to your needs/goals , has a section for athletes too: http://thriveforward.com/Vitamin B12 Vitamin K2 Fatty acids (flax,hemp,chia) Creatine (I take 3gr on non meat days)Might have been points where you are missing the boat.But I had exactly the same issues a total failure to thrive while dropping meat 100% for 2,5 weeks. I started feeling weaker and weaker, even though I was actually watching all but the K2 at that time.For now I’m sticking with 2 meat days out of 7 which for me seems to work. If I find new possible missing links I’ll give it another try.Complex, whole starches are key. This includes brown rice, beans, potatoes, etc. I typically consume around 2300+ calories depending on my physical activity level and I do this through complex carbohydrate based meals.Wonderful! So glad I like my beans.Phew your kid holding the cat looks gravely ill, is she all right? Is she allowed to go to the hospital?I wrote an article about this a while back. Not all Paleo blogs doom beans for phytates. In fact, I happen to agree to some benefits of phytates. If you like beans and they don’t bother your gut, then that’s great. http://originaleating.com/paleo-101/real-reason-say-eat-legumes/Great Stuff! Wondering… Seems scientists at the University of Exeter in England have published a study that suggests smelling farts could actually prevent cancer, among and other diseases. Turns out, the hydrogen sulfide gases created in the gut while breaking down food, in small doses, preserve the mitochondria in cells and thus, prevent disease. They are even working on a compound (AP39) that could deliver small doses of the gas. That all said, I wonder if the phytate mystery for colon cancer might be related to this mitochondria effect also?So, it seems, beans, beans “effect” are not just good for your heart! ;)Thanks Dr for this wonderful site and resource.BillBottom line: Soak almonds or not?if i eat beans daily is that too much proteinToxins answered that below, no studies show adverse effects from lots of beans, eat up!","['antinutrients', 'beans', 'breast cancer', 'breast health', 'calcium', 'cancer', 'cancer survival', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cardiovascular health', 'chemotherapy', 'colon cancer', 'colon health', 'diabetes', 'fiber', 'fruit', 'grains', 'heart disease', 'heart health', 'kidney disease', 'kidney health', 'kidney stones', 'low-fat diets', 'metastases', 'mortality', 'National Cancer Institute', 'nuts', 'osteoporosis', 'phytates', 'phytic acid', 'polyps', 'prediabetes', 'rectal cancer', 'seeds', 'side effects', 'vegetables', 'vitamins', ""women's health""]",Do the anti-cancer effects of phytates in a petri dish translate out into clinical studies on cancer prevention and treatment?,"I talked about the role of fiber versus phytate in colon cancer in my video Phytates for the Prevention of Cancer, the first in this 3-part video series.

Is this healthy or does it fall into the “don’t eat” category of kimchi? Also, is the science convincing that Natto is healthy? Any possible side effects of thinning the blood too much, preventing proper blood clotting? Thank you.Natto is the vegan food highest in spermidine and K2 Mk7, and that is enough to make it intriguing. It’s very much an acquired taste though, I occasionally order natto sushi rolls, and they’re always the last thing on the plate.It also lacks the high salt content which IMO is the likely issue with kimchi.Thanks. Just curious, you mentioned you sometimes order natto sushi rolls….do you ever have any raw fish sushi , even in small amounts?Not since January 2010. But I’ll try the few vegan options when accompanying family to a sushi restaurant. My favorite at a local place with a vegetarian menu is the “Teardrop Roll” made with real Wasabia japonica.Sushi refers to the vinegar & sugar seasoned rice, sashimi is the raw fish often included.If no fish in your diet do you take a vegan DHA supplement?Actually, a DHA/EPA supplement. As I’m not an infant, pregnant or nursing, the DHA is less important to me than achieving as high a ratio of EPA to arachidonic acid as feasible. I think the EPA helps reduce inflammatory signalling in the context of a low fat, low (or no) animal product diet, but I’m not surprised low-dose fish-oil supplementation has limited effects in the context of high fat and high arachidonic acid Western diets.Is your supplement an algae DHA/EPA or is it fish oil derived? Thank you much. I value your insight and choices on these and other vegan concerns.I’m agree with you on the EPA importance. I have been looking for a vegan supplement with more EPA in it than DHA, but no luck. I hear that more EPA than DHA can be better, for certain issues, but if too high DHA to EPA, things can get messed up.There’s interconversion in vivo of the two long-chain n-3 fatty acids, though I don’t know how effective it is. There’s one major algal LCPUFA supplier at present (all the vegan brands are rebranding), and their most cost effective supplement is 130 mg EPA and 300 mg DHA per capsule. That ratio, though perhaps not absolute quantities, is common to all the algal EPA+DHA supplements.Why am I not surprised by this? For better and often for worse, the US allegedly protects the “freedom to” instead of the “freedom from”. That is until it hits big corporations in the pocket.Why does fact always have to be more shocking than fiction!It never ceases to amaze me at how the meat and dairy industries can turn a blind eye to the problems they cause. Really? Would they say and do ludicrous things like this to their own children?LOVE the analogy at the end!!I didn’t see anything in the video about kimchi. Why would kimchi be considered a “don’t eat” food?We eat it regularly. Does this mean we are also supposed to stop eating sauerkraut and fermented vegetables in general? I thought they were about the healthiest thing to eat. John S PDX ORDr. Greger has a video and in it he says that kimchi is not safe to consume. I think he feels it causes and or is associated with developing cancer. As far Natto, I do not know. My concern with natto is that it might do both good and bad, as far as fibrin.Thanks for helping me find the video Leslie. Since these are the only two studies I’ve heard of, and no other health doctor I’ve ever heard of has warned against kimchi, I’m going to take it with a grain of salt. I would love to see follow up studies. For example, kim chi has tons of red chilis in it. Is that large amount of chilis causing the gastric cancer? We don’t know.Dr. Greger seemed not to waver on this. Very clear on it. And others here seem to believe his conviction. I really think something in the data convinced him that kimchi is/can be harmful, even in moderation.Reason behind Kimchi causing cancers: Exerpt from Gastric Cancer Epidemiology (Link at end of post)It appears it’s not the cabbage that is the problem, it’s the salt that the cabbage comes in that is the problem.“1) Salt or salted foodThe average daily salt intake in the Korean population was 13.4 g in 2005,(23) whereas the daily intake recommended by the World Health Organization is less than 5 g.(24) Ingestion of salt directly damages the stomach lining, enhancing the carcinogenic effects of gastric carcinogens, increasing nitroso compound formation, and facilitating H. pylori infection.(25) An ecological study on the association between sodium intake evaluated by 24-hour urine collection and gastric cancer mortality and incidence in four areas of Korea suggested a positive correlation between sodium intake and gastric cancer incidence and mortality.(26) A salt preference showed a 1.1-fold increased risk for gastric cancer in a cohort study of 2,248,129 subjects.(27)“Kimchi, which is allegedly believed to have anti-carcinogenic properties, accounts for approximately 20% of sodium intake.(23) Case-control studies on the intake level of kimchi and gastric cancer risk generally showed an increased risk among subjects with high or frequent intakes of kimchi.(28-30) In addition, a high intake of soybean paste (28) or frequent intake of soybean paste stew (31) increased the risk of gastric cancer.”And this last statement on soy and gastric cancer shows again it’s the salt because we know soy is a healthy food to eat and actually lowers the incidence of cancer when in it’s whole, plant food form.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3204471/Awesome reply. Thanks so much. There is hope that kimchi will once again be allowed on our vegan-plates!.Then does that mean Sauerkraut is also risky?Big business controls everything for their own advantage.Right on! I learned this too late for my osteoporosis, which is really bad. And after reading the book, Deadly Monopolies and doing some basic research online with every product my physicians have prescribed, which are recombinant dna from E-coli bacteria, I decided not to trust the U.S. FDA or the biotechnology-pharmaceutical companies any more than I trust the biotech-pesticide corporations who are poisoning our food with GMO’s made from E-coli and other antibiotic resistant bacteria in order for the plant to resist lethal amounts of herbicides.I ordered a worm farm and red worms, which I’m feeding nutrient rich certified organic vegan foods, in order to create my own fertilizer to grow certified organic seeds in raised beds.Don Huber, an award-winning, internationally recognized scientist, and professor of plant pathology at Purdue University for the past 35 years focused his agricultural research on the epidemiology and control of soil-borne plant pathogens, with specific emphasis on microbial ecology, cultural and biological controls, and the physiology of host-parasite relationships. He is an expert in his many fields.Dr. Huber says: “About 85 percent of all genetically engineered plants are herbicide-tolerant—designed to tolerate very high levels of herbicides, glyphosate in particular. These are the so-called Roundup Ready crops.It’s important to realize that Glyphosate is not ‘just’ an herbicide. It was first patented as a mineral chelator. It immobilizes nutrients, so they are not physiologically available for your body…”I took this very seriously when embarking on eating vegan foods, and only purchase organically grown and produced crops of whole food. Hopefully, my compost will be ready before vested corporate interests and their allies in government dismantle organic food production in the USA and around the world.My orthopedic surgeon said he had never seen anyone grow bone as fast as I after a fractured pelvis. Hopefully my lumbar fracture will heal just as quickly, because I refuse to ingest biologics. Don’t trust the horrible side effects of not affecting me. Would rather go with what I have without more health damage from the drugs.what is wrong with Kimchi?apparently it might cause cancer. Dr. Greger says so.This study appears to be the best explanation I have yet found. I may stop eating kimchi with radish in it, and pay attention to further studies.http://kimchicancer.blogspot.com/2013/02/does-kimchi-cause-gastric-cancer.htmlJOhn S PDX ORRadishes appear to be one of the foods with high nitrates in them, and nitrates have been implicated in some cancers. Koreans in general have high rates of stomach and gastric cancer, although that may have something to do with the large amount of barbecued meat that they eat. For right now, I will choose the napa cabbage kimchi, which according to the study, was associated with lower rates of gastric cancer, rather than the radish kimchi, which was associated with higher rates.Very high nitrate levels (> 250 mg/100 g*): arugula (rocket or rucola), bok choy, celery, chervil, collard greens, cress, lettuce, radish, red beetroot, rhubarb, spinach, Swiss chard.From this athletic health website:http://www.caroltorgan.com/athletic-performance-beetroot-juice-nitrates-spit/ JOhn S PDX ORnitrates and nitrites are 2 different compounds. Dr. Greger covers nitrates here. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-nitrates-pollutants-or-nutrients/To summarize, when you consume plant foods, they may contain nitrates. These nitrates alone are not harmful, they are absorbed and recirculated to your mouth and the oral flora converts nitrates to nitrites. The journey continues as nitrates enter your stomach. At this point, if one has consumed a fatty meal, as commonly found with nitrites in cured animal products, then the nitrites become nitrosamines which are indeed carcinogenic. In the absence of fat, the nitrites become nitric oxide and contribute to the mitochondrial efficiency of cells, including skeletal muscles.Big scandal in the meat industry, as revealed by investigative reporter Upton Sinclair working undercover in a meat packing plant in Chicago.

Anybody want to try it and make suggestions?Harriet, health journalist, Montreal http://www.eatandbeatcancer.comIngredients· 1 cup dried yellow or orange lentils· 4 cups water· 1 T olive oil· ¼ tsp mustard seeds· 2-3 small yellow onions, diced· 1/4 tsp each: turmeric, cumin, coriander powder· 2 cloves garlic, chopped plus extra for garnish· ½ tsp chopped ginger· 1-2 lemons – juice only· ¼ tsp cayenne· salt and pepper· handful cilantro, choppedSpice Prep (Hi, folks. I do this so you can easily figure out which spices to grab and how to measure them.)· 1/4 tsp each: mustard seeds, turmeric, cumin, coriander powder, cayenne· 1/2 tsp chopped gingerMethod1. Spread the beans on a baking sheet, pick out the misfits, then wash the keepers several times in warm water and drain them.2. To sprout (optional but healthful and tasty): Put the washed beans in a large, shallow bowl and add 3 cups warm water (3 times the amount of beans), cover with a cloth towel, then place away from sunlight and soak overnight. Rinse and drain, then place soaked beans in a large sprouting jar with a mesh lid. Turn jar upside down in a bowl and tilt it slightly on an angle so the moisture will drain. Continue rinsing and draining at least twice a day for 2-3 days. When the beans’ tails are about ¼” long, they’re ready. (They’ll keep in the fridge for a couple of days until you’re ready to use them.)3. Put beans and 4 cups water in a pot and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, covered, approximately 20 minutes, adding a little salt at the end of the cooking process.4. In a separate pan, heat oil on low to medium heat and then add the mustard seeds. As the seeds pop, add the onions and saute for a minute or so. Add turmeric, cumin and coriander powder and mix, then add garlic and ginger and continue sauteeing. Your onions should cook for 4-5 minutes max.5. Combine cooked onion mixture with warm, cooked lentils and stir well. Add cayenne, lemon juice and salt to taste, and then let the soup sit.6. Garnish with cilantro, black pepper and freshly minced garlic. Goes well with side of leafy greens. Or just throw the greens right into the soup.Hi everyone. Try my mung dal recipe!

It incorporates chard as well. http://wp.me/p53zk6-2Thanks Kevin!Don’t forget Dr. Fuhrman’s books, check out TED: Julieanna Hever, and Kathy Freston, and their books. Julieanna just came out with another wonderful book for you and your loved ones!!!!/Vegiterranean….; Dean Ornish has done some great/GREAT research/get his Spectrum book!!!!would you recommend the curcumin supplements?What is the most effective form of curcumin and at what dosage?The bioavailability of curcumin is very low according to a clinical study done in Molecular Pharmaceutics 2007,4 (6),807-818. BCM-95 is a highly absorbable form of curcumin which is 10 times more absorbable than the standard 95% curcumin.My friend read yesterday’s post…and commented that she’d taken turmeric capsules until she realized her white hair was turning yellow…anyone else had this result?No…but I did once take ~ 25,000 IU / day beta-carotene during summer and I had a very deep tan…didn’t affect hair color.It could only be from the turmeric if the color change was only at the roots of her hair – like the way the real color of hair shows up in the roots as dyed hair is growing out.In general, how are larger molecules -specifically proteins ( e.g. hormones from milk ) – absorbed ? They are/should too large for diffusion in the absence of leaky gut. Endocytosis ? Should not they be broken down to amino acids or short peptides thus loosing their biologic if not antigenic activity ?Thank you Dr Gregory! My wife and I have been taking a brand by Life Extension containing 500mg Nigella sativa, an organic black cumin seed oil, combined with 200 mg Curcuma longa, an extract root with “Curcuminoids Complex with Essential Oils of Turmeric Rhizome…” for a few weeks, and I can’t tell if it’s really making much of a difference. I have some moderate osteoarthritis in all my finger joints, as does my wife, and she has moderate to severe osteoarthritis in one knee. Time will tell, but maybe it makes more sense to begin enjoying curry dishes more often. :-) Thanks again for the work you do here at NutritionFacts.I’m interested in this as well. In PubMed a search for “curcumin” yields 6277 studies and “Nigella” 624. I also tried to find info re: black cumin seed oil vs. the whole (ground) seed. Maybe Gr. Greger has some insight.Isn’t curcumin very hard to absorb much of? I know there have been ongoing tweaks to extracts/supplements to overcome this (adding peperine, phosphystidyl serine, super critical CO2 extraction) so as to get a truly therapeutic dose. I would also like to know if you, Dr Greger have any suggestions along those lines. Just turmeric in diet shows as demographically good for prevention, but what about individuals who have a current problem and wish to alleviate/reverse it?Dr Greger discusses research about how black pepper DRAMATICALLY increases bioavailability of curcumin. See his answer to the question: What about pepper plus turmeric in V8 juice. .Please fix the broken link to Who Shouldn’t Consume Curcumin or Turmeric. A word search does not result in a definitive video for this topic.I believe that’s because it hasn’t been “published” online yet, it’s only available on his newest DVD, Volume 16. BUT, I think it will be the video Dr Greger will be posting tomorrow – Monday 1-20-14.Many of these articles relate to a derivative of the core product i.e. “Curcumin”, from “Turmeric”, which turn out to be pricey products from pharma or health stores. What amount of turmeric do we actually need to eat for it be effective in our diet?I TAKE TUMARIC FROM WALMART BEEN TAKING 1 TO 2 PILLS A DAY FOR ALMOST THREE MONTHS .I DONT NEED TO WERE WRIST BRACES ANY MORE TO SLEEP ..MY HANDS DONT FALL ASLEEP ANY MORE .GAVE THE ARCH IN MY FEET BETTER FLEX MY KNEES HAVE FULL RANGE MOTION ITS COST 7 DOLLARS A BOTTLE …I TRIED IN FOOD IT STAINS AND IS HARCH TASTE TO IT .I DID LIKE IN A STRAWBERRY SMOOTHIE BUT I LIKE BITTER ..Ibuprophin also implicated in kidney cancer.http://nutritionstripped.com/turmeric-milk/I make this w soy or almond milk. I try to stay with real foods rather than pills or extracts.This is a very useful article, since about many of us will have to deal with OA at some point in our lives. I have some work-induced OA in my finger joints. I wish I could turn back the clock, and I am hoping nutrition will come up with an answer to repair damaged cartilage. The vegan diet immediately (2-3 weeks) halted all symptoms for 6 months. Now, I only have morning stiffness for a few seconds, but I’m only in my early 40’s so having a progressive chronic condition is unsettling. This article shows I really must work harder on my major weakness (sugar).Is there a definitive answer to what dosage of curcumin supplements are effective for osteoarthritis? I have been following a vegan diet for the better part of a year, but I seriously doubt I will be incorporating tumeric into my cooking in a daily or even regular basis. Have been taking 375mg supplements for about a month without strong evidence of improvement, so I am curious about whether to increase the dosage or if it is even recommended.In the 8 month study cited above Meriva 500 mg twice a day was used. That formulation showed a 20-fold increase in bioavailabilty vs. plain curcumin. These studies are available on Pubmed.Dr. Greger, are there any studies on the benefits of kefir? Does kefir affect the absorption on phytonutrients similar to milk products?lively1: Kefir is just another form for dairy. While it may have some probiotics, the food is a package deal. You have to take the bad with the good. And oh boy, is there plenty of bad. for more information about dairy:http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/If you really like kefir, I would recommend checking out non-dairy kefir. You might look into a coconut based commercial one or maybe even check out making your own water based kefir. Some people really love that stuff.Good luck.This is an easy Dal recipe http://happyherbivore.com/recipe/red-lentil-dal/May I just add that “curry” is a meaningless term. Indian grocery stores carry Garam Masala which means hot spices. Each mix will be different depending on who put the mix together and what part of India the cook was from. A Bengali would mix a 5-spice masala called panch phoron.This in no way would resemble a Gujrati masala. When someone adds the notation, “1 teaspoon garam masala.” it is absolutely useless. Does the Masala add fenugreek ,whole cumin,and kala jeera? Or does it add caraway, coriander,ginger, garlic,anise seed? You actually can find Curry leaves in Indian grocery stores. They smell heavenly. They are labeled Karbev leaves and I add them to only one dish-Upma,the world’s best breakfast.Mustard oil is used by Bengalis a great deal. They love eating fish and mustard oil is part of the preparation of them. I fry the fish in half mustard oil,half olive oil. But that’s not enough for the average Bengali. The “jhol” or sauce is made of thin slice chilies,salt,a heaping teaspoon or more of turmeric tempered in the oil during the frying,and 2-3 tsps of dry mustard mixed with water added to the pan till the fish is swimming once again.KartofflMuter: NutritionFacts.org has a lot of very helpful information about fish. Here are some links to get you started if you are interested: http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=fishNo More -itis Rice-1 cup brown short grain rice -1 red onion, chopped -3 stalks celery, diced -3 shallots, chopped -3 cloves garlic, minced -9 white button mushrooms, quartered -1 tbsp salt-free curry powder -1 tbsp marjoram -½ tbsp oregano -2 cups water/homemade vegetable broth -6 collard fronds, cut in ribbons then in half -6 swiss chard fronds, cut in ribbons then in half -1 tbsp apple cider vinegarCrush and mince garlic, then set aside. Add all ingredients, except garlic, greens, and vinegar, to a pot. Bring water to boil, then lower heat and simmer, covered, until water absorbed and rice tender. Turn off heat and stir in garlic, greens, and vinegar. Stir to combine and serve.~complements of plant-based emporiumHi Dr. McGregor,I’m a 23-year-old woman and recently saw my doctor because I’ve been noticing joint pain and morning stiffness in the middle knuckles of my fingers (mostly right ring finger and left index finger). She did a blood test for Rheumatoid, which was negative, so she diagnosed me with osteoarthritis and said to take Aleve as needed. She said it was uncommon at my age but that it can affect anyone, just like “some people go gray early.”The problem is, I’m a classical violinist in my last year of a Masters in Music Performance, and the agility of my fingers is crucial to my profession. I will do anything and everything to stop or at least slow the progression of this disease, I just don’t know what to do. My doctor doesn’t seem to believe there is a nutritional component.I’ve always been vegetarian, and lately have been leaning more towards veganism, but would regularly cheat when I went out to eat (which is a lot).I’m thinking I should try a strict elimination diet for 4 weeks, to see if what I eat is causing inflammation. I have heard meat (don’t eat this anyway), dairy, eggs, gluten, corn, refined sugar, caffeine, alcohol, and even white potatoes (?) should be eliminated as possible triggers.I also just bought a joint supplement by Irwin Naturals called 3-1 Joint Formula, which has vitamin E, Niacin, Folic Acid, B12, Manganese, Fish and Flax oils, Glucosamine Sulfate (1500 mcg), Chondrotin Sulfate (1200 mcg), MSM, Indian Frankincense, Stinging Nettle, Turmeric extract (95% curcuminoids, rhizome) 40 mg, Alpha-Lipoic Acid, and “BioPerine” (95% piperine, 5% gingerols)Would you recommend this approach? If not, what do you think I should do?I would be *very* grateful for your opinion.Thank you, Suffering ViolinistSuffering Violinist: I’m sorry to hear about your problem! That would be a bummer for anyone, but for a young woman who needs healthy hands for her living, the story is particularly painful to hear about.I’m not an expert, but I wanted to express some support. I think your plan makes a whole lot of sense. I’ve heard that even small amounts of dairy and be a problem for people. So, going on a strict elimination diet where the base diet is made up of nothing but whole whole plant foods makes a lot of sense to me. You might also look up other videos on this website with the topic of arthritis and inflammation to see if you can pick up other tips.I sure do hope this works out for you.I would also ask your doctor about an inflammation assay test. I heard through a third party and don’t know the details, but they took a bunch of common foods and made a grid, kind of like allergy tests. I assume that they put a drop of blood on each, but I don’t actually remember. When the results were in, the woman in question had a list of foods not to eat. In something like 6 months she went from being afraid she would need to stay in a wheel chair to feeling “Almost normal”, or at least able to take part in life. Sorry I don’t have the specifics.Nothing wrong with potatoes or gluten.. i’d say go for a low-fat (no oil) vegan diet, using recipes containing curcumin, as well as potassium-rich foods (tomato paste/puree, legumes, leafy greens).. Tomato-based ethiopian/indian dals, potato curries, etc. :)One fairly easy potato curry recipe that I sometimes make, either with vegan fat-free pancakes, or with rice, is this one:2 tablespoons raw sesame oil, vegetable oil, or ghee 2 teaspoons minced garlic or garlic mashed to a paste 1 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes 1 cup finely chopped shallots 1 cup chopped tomatoes 2 green cayenne chiles, seeded and chopped ½ teaspoon turmeric ½ teaspoon black mustard seeds 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander ¼ cup water 1 teaspoon salt, or to tasteHeat water in a wok or karhai or wide pot over medium heat. Add 1 teaspoon garlic and cook for a minute, then add the potatoes and shallots. Stir-fry for several minutes, until the shallots have softened, pressing the potato cubes against the surface of the hot pan, then add the chopped tomatoes and chiles and stir to blend. Add small amounts of water (pour from a glass, in 2-3 tbsp increments) to the pan if the food sticks to the surface. Add the turmeric, mustard seeds, cumin, coriander, and the remaining 1 teaspoon garlic and stir. Add the water and salt and bring to a boil. Cover tightly and simmer vigorously until the potatoes are just tender, about 20 minutes. Check after 10 or 12 minutes to make sure there is enough liquid and that nothing is sticking; add a little more water if necessary.If we add Vitamin c and omega 3 fatty acids in daily diet or through nutrition suppliments then Rheumatoid Arthritis will get reduced within 3 months.I have had good success with my knee when taking (and still take it daily!) Tumeric; I mix with coconut oil and swallow as best as I can, since I am not in a place with a kitchen, I can mix this blend, put it into little ice trays and pop out what I need when it’s cold from the fridge. I also add a bit of pepper since it has 6% piperine, and that makes a concoction that goes almost immediately into the bloodstream after hitting the liver. I’m feeling so much better after about 45 days of daily dosages (around 400mg) that I’m writing Get My Happy On! about my experiences. Find me on FB!!clairefranceperez: I justhappened to know someone who was recently diagnosed with osteoarthritis in the knee. Your post could not have come at a better time. I’m going to forward on your success story. Thanks for sharing!Understand that I was NOT able at all to walk for about six weeks last Christmas. I had to do bed rest and lay uselessly around, using a task chair to wheel my painfully contracted leg around; was it meniscus? Arthritis? Later, a chiropractor laid me on the stomach and then used my lower leg to actually grind the knee cap and man that was painful. However, I never had pain again! Just muscle atrophy which is being addressed with private yoga classes. I walk with very little limping now.What about Polymyalgia rheumatica. I have an aunt that I switched to a WFPB diet about 10 months ago. She had a menengioma tumor the size of a baseball removed summer 2013 and had a lot of infections after and has only recently begun to walk again. She has lost 70 pounds since January and has been on a strict WFPB diet that I make for her. Lately her SED rate has been elevated which means she has inflammation in her body somewhere. In the past she was diagnosed with the rheumatica and was on a low dose of Prednisone for years. I was able to get her off of blood pressure medicine, cholesterol medicine, acid reflux medicine, she no longer has gout and, as I said, dropped a good deal of weight. I don’t like what I read about the side affects of Prednisone so wondered if Turmeric would be something that might work here? ieatplants.com is where I blog about our experiencesGOD himself knows how much I love each and every post/video/blog post….; The subject matter can be confusing enough/what with all the misinformation fomented by “the experts”. With such as posting at this, it would be helpful to give some guidance as to approximately how much and how often a beneficial amount would be to be a part of ones daily intake. And, it is such a benefit to had black pepper/as you have notated/that that too should somehow be a part of such messages.

Get some manners, or I’m going to have to stop coming to the website to watch or read you. (I’ll just watch when you happen to show up in my youtube recommendations.) I don’t do “uncomfortable” for anyone, and your arbitrary and capricious responses are irritating. Bottom line: Either respond to everyone or no one. (And “Happy Holidays” fits everyone.) Happy Holidays!PMH, there is a team of nutritionfacts volunteers (like myself) who can address questions you may have. It is impossible to address every question, and at one point early on in nutritionfacts Dr. Greger did do this. The popularity of the site has grown beyond what Dr. Greger can handle. Remember, nutritionfacts.org is not his job, it is his side “hobby” done purely without profit and we should be grateful he has done this for the public good.Thanks for the civil response. I guess I haven’t been around long enough to have seen enough “volunteer” responses to notice your existence. All I’ve seen is video introductions by Gregor with entreaties to ask questions (to which I see plenty of responses with no answers). “Public good” is one thing, but so is the simple courtesy of answering questions you asked for. I don’t see that language in this post. Perhaps what I’m seeing is early posts that include out-of-date sentiment of pure solicitation (i.e., “please make me look successful by asking me questions!”). One can only hope.You will notice that every so often Dr. Greger will dig deep and answer a question in depth in the link below. http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/That link is helpful. I guess the true source of my irritation is having Dr. Greger introduce something really pertinent to my personal interests, have people bring up questions in the comments I’d also like answers to, and then – nothing. I see several “in depth” treatment of issues I might find answers or insight into in that link. Thanks!You are certainly demanding.and you are irrelevant.Irrelevant is your view that the world revolves around you.He has other hats to wear.Fair enough about time constraints that limit the number of comments that Dr. Greger can directly respond to, but I would at least like to see in-depth responses to all comments and questions that legitimately challenge the accuracy of content provided by Dr. Greger’s videos.Dr. Greger has assumed the responsibility of being a messenger of the science of nutrition to the general public. Therefore, he should also be prepared to defend the accuracy of what he says and, where warranted, seek more information and provide clarification.As a recent example, I would like to see an acknowledgement and response to this recent thoughtful challenge by Darryl to Dr. Greger’s description of the mechanism by which nutritional antioxidants provide health benefits.You’ve expressed the precise logic behind the impetus of my original comment, albeit with slightly (that’s a joke) more restraint. Thank you! I apologize to you and anyone I offended by my less than PC bluntness. As I get sicker, time grows shorter and more precious. Nowadays my ability to tolerate even the smallest trifle is (I see) non-existent.You’re the one in need of manners…Doubt you would know a grace if one bit you in the butt.Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas….And a Happy New Year….Too bad if you do not like it!Filtering system, please. It is too time consuming to have to sift through rantings.Just curious, when one says “Happy Holidays” what holidays of what kind are they referring to? If it suits everyone, – then everyone has the same kind of holidays – but from what? Why are there holidays ? Just curious ….pmh: Personally, I really appreciate that Dr. Greger responds when he can. I don’t consider it rude at all that he doesn’t respond to every question, especially when so many of the questions have already been answered. I would rather Dr. Greger spend his time on producing new content for this site.As for your, Happy Holidays, it is a myth that it applies to everyone. If you wish to be respectful of your fellow humans, you will be careful how you use it.For example, Jehovah Witnesses do no such celebrations.Yep.pmh: am so sorry, but by seeing your respond above. i know the issue is not in Dr. Greger and not from the NF team whose both i respect. they did good enough for whatever the can contribute in this area. you are not the only one that rarely be answered by Dr. Greger and by the team, me too, i ask many times but many times unanswered.. still i am okay with that. so be secure for your self whenever you find your question or someone’s question hasnt been answered for long. bottom line: the issue is on you including your happy holidays issue, u really need to check your “heart”, dont sweat such things. u wont get sick by such words.You should consider spending more time minding your own psychological and emotional health, and less on projecting your own illnesses onto the hearts and minds of perfect strangers.Irony of the century.The civil part of this conversation ended 4 days ago. Learn to read – or in your case – when to stop.This saddening to some of us. Please let it end. Many of us have much greater life stress. Please don’t add to it here.Then stop contributing to it! Do you have a greater life stresser than end-stage progressive multiple sclerosis for which the only hope I now have of reclaiming some resemblance of a functional life after 30 years of failed traditional medicine is in some complex nutritional key to nerve regeneration hidden within the answers to some of these questions? Really people, I don’t give a fig about your opinion of my comment. You bring on your own stress by dwelling on stupid things. Get the bleep over it!Is it true that selenium binds with mercury and eliminates it out of the body? For those of us NOT trying to get pregnant but still having a few amalgam fillings, would it be helpful to eat 1-2 brazil nuts a day to eliminate the mercury out of our bodies faster?In the Christmas spirit, may I offer this about mercury (Hg) and amalgam fillings. As long as a person has ‘silver fillings’, i.e., amalgams, in one’s mouth, mercury is still releasing and no amount of Brazil nuts a day would eliminate the mercury since the source is still emitting Hg. Assays on amalgams removed indicate that Hg releases from amalgam fillings over the time they are in the mouth. The indicator of that fact is this: Amalgam fillings are 50% Hg and 50% what’s called a eutectic mixture consisting of copper, tin, silver, and zinc, so there should be 50% Hg in the removed filling. Assays have indicated Hg content down from 50% to between 24 and 26%. The missing Hg either vaporizes or is abraded by chewing action. Many European countries long ago banned the use of mercury in dental fillings. The better part of discretion, I think, would be to have the amalgam fillings removed CORRECTLY by a dentist who is familiar with the proper procedure/protocol, and go on a detox program with proper supervision. Then you will be able to eliminate much of the mercury, if you don’t eat tuna, swordfish, mackerel and seafood, i.e., crustaceans, which are bottom dwellers that are subject to more pollutants.The video audio was 10% of the norm and impossible to hear.

Merry Christmas to you as well!.Nothing wrong with the video, check your equipment…Dr Greger, What is a good way to stay cognitively intact as we age, other than eating a plant-based diet? Are there specific foods you recommend (e.g. cocoa) that help to save off mild cognitive impairment and gradual cognitive decline? Many thanks and a fan of yours, DHThis is a very in-depth question. So the best way to get the answer to your questions is to use the search engine on this website.Here is the search I did for Cognitive Decline: http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=cognitive+declineThat is a very in-depth question. So the best way to get information to you inquiry is to use the search engine on this website.Here are the search results for Cognitive Decline: http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=cognitive+declineDH: I recommend Dr. Barnard’s book, “Power Foods For The Brain – An Effective 3-Step Plan to Protect Your Mind and Strengthen Your Memory” He also has a companion video, with less info, that is well done and perhaps worth sharing with trusted patients: “As seen on public TV: Protect Your Memory”Yes this is also a good resource as well with lots of very helpful and useful info. thanks Thea!

I also have well-wishes for you! If you are in part of the world experiencing extreme cold, I also hope you are staying nice and warm. Take care.i think that the best way to protect the “mind” is to use it!! :-) Apart from the correct nutrition; logic/math games, meditation and having different kind of interests keep the mind smart and ready to learn something new everyday… IMHO obviously… even music could plays an important role in this issue…Since I did not see an answer from the doc. How ’bout excersize and Lumosity. Sorry about my spelling and budding in.Here are 7 scientific studies that indicate that fish eaters are not more likely to develop diabetes compared to people who don’t eat fish, thereby contradicting the 1 scientific study that Dr. Greger shared with us: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14707894 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8068603 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1872925 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22442397 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12351475 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20656466 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20534874 http://www.omega3innovations.com/index.php/fish-oil-benefits-type-2-diabetes/Conclusion: Eating fish without any salt added will greatly lower our risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, stroke, all cancers, brain diseases, bone diseases, kidney diseases, any many other killer diseases without increasing our risk of developing diabetes. Because diabetics frequently die of cardiovascular causes, diabetics who eat fish (or swallow fish oil softgels) will live much longer than diabetics who become deficient in marine omega-3s.According to the following scientific study, the people who ate too much white rice had a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24158434 In this same study, the people who ate brown rice or other whole grains had a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.My hypothesis: People who eat fish tend to eat more white rice than people who don’t eat fish. Therefore, white rice consumption should be made an important confounding factor in all scientific studies that try to connect fish consumption with diabetes risk.In other words, people who always eat fish without white rice would have a very low risk of developing type 2 diabetes but people who always eat fish with plenty of white rice would have a very high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.I’ve just read the transcript and the questions below. However, what I know about mercury is that is passes through the blood brain barrier (BBB). Too much causes Minimata disease (aka Mad Hatter’s disease), somehow interfering or damaging brain cells. So even though Mercury has a 2 month half-life in hair samples and blood, how do we know it isn’t accumulating in the brain? I suppose that once it passes through the BBB, it could pass out of the brain as well, but does anyone have any knowledge about this? My previous understanding was that mercury was bioaccumulative. Thanks!It’s so frustrating that even the “healthy” foods are now dangerous.Reuven: Happily, the real healthy foods are plentiful. Eat whole foods in these categories: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. Wash them down with teas like green and hibiscus. All of those foods, in general, always have been and (based on our current knowledge) likely always will be healthy.It is only those questionable foods, like fish, which have been falsely promoted as healthy due to history and politics that appear to be switching sides. I completely understand the frustration. I just think it is worth putting into perspective.Good luck!I am a graduate student who will be attending medical school next fall. I am required to re-immunize for hep B after showing no resistance to it from the titter. I was hoping you would be able to provide options for the safest vaccines out there, not only for myself but for my children as well. Any help would be greatly appreciated.Does this imply that women should loose weight before pregnancy to prevent pollutants stored in their fat cells from releasing PCBs?so stay away from vaccines due to mercury?They also contain bovine serum is that worth the risk too?I’m studying for an exam tomorrow on pregnancy nutrition as part of an RD program and I’m supposed to be recommending 1-3 meals of bottom-feeder fish every week for fetal development. I saw the video and am now very curious.Are you saying that the mercury levels in most fish, if eaten once a week during pregnancy, are worse for infant health than the exposure of mercury over 6 vaccine injections?Based on the title (and the title versus the information within the video), I wanted to make sure I understood your point correctly. Thank you!Hi Bethany, are you still interested in a response? How did the RD exam go?! Best wishes let me know if you are still interested.Hi Joseph, I would like to know your response. I posed a similar question to Dr. Greger today? Thanks,I am not sure if it’s worse for infant health. The study highlighted was just looking at how much mercury an infant may accumulate from breast milk in mother’s who ate fish vs. how much mercury infants accumulated from mercury-containing vaccines. The full study can be found in sources cited. I think the point is that mercury from mothers milk is similar in concentration to that of vaccinations, based on that study.Off-topic as well, slightly only though. Newborns have immune tolerance for a period that goes from up to about 6 to 18 months. Shouldn’t we wait for babies to finish their period of immune tolerance before exposing them to ANY vaccines? Because if these babies were to recognize a virus as part of the “normal” environnent they need to be ready to take part in wouldn’t a vaccine end up doing the very opposite from what’s it’s supposed to do?My Uncle is Pediatrician he says it makes no sense to wait on vaccines, as the really bad diseases affect infants, and young children the most. Pertussis, Meningitis, etc. All preventable with minuscule risk. This is a chart from the CDC on a vaccine timeline.1) I do not doubt that your uncle said that. In fact many pediatricians say that. My question isn’t so much what does the medical body say, I know what they say. I am more interested in question what seems like a dogma ignoring fundamental biological data. A) My question to you is do you of a period of immune tolerance at birth? B) Does you uncle know? It’s in medical textbooks in France, in fact it’s in high-school textbooks too in France and it seems like there is little doubt of about that being a fact. That’s the plane I’m interested in debating on, observed biological facts. C) Do you or not have the knowledge or the proof of the opposite that when a baby is born, it comes to the world inheriting its mother immune system, which slowly fades out as the child develops its own? D) Finally, after you check the above facts, and are able to confirm them or infirm them on biological grounds, I ask: why would a child from a vaccined mother receive a vaccine during a period where 1) he/she doesn’t need it since the mother’s vaccined immune system is inherited 2) he/she is at risk of recognizing the virus as part of the normal/tolerated environment of the body. Note: Appendix 1: The entire hygiene theory related to the prevention of asthma / allergies is based on exposing children to the natural environment during the period of immune tolerance. Appendix 2: If you’ve heard of neonatal graft requiring no need for later immune suppressants (done in humans as well) it is based the same neonatal immune tolerance. 2) On “miniscule risk”. Is it your impression or a fact. You seem to present it like a fact. Would you say for certain that early vaccines have no link with much later degenerative disease?Note on form and intention: There is no personal challenge here although reading the text only without the man it may seem like it I reckon. I invite you, in a friendly manner and certainly intention to look into biological fundamentals, nothing more. If I am wrong on certain points I’ve always welcomed people to show me so, all I require is a scientific process and a genuine intention to establish the truth rather than a point. There’s nothing I invite more vividly than an opportunity to upgrade my paradigm of the truth.","['abdominal fat', 'animal products', 'beef', 'body fat', 'brain disease', 'brain health', 'children', 'cognition', 'DDT', 'detoxification', 'DHA', 'diabetes', 'dioxins', 'EPA', 'fat', 'FDA', 'fish', 'industrial toxins', 'infants', 'meat', 'mercury', 'obesity', 'omega-3 fatty acids', 'PBCs', 'persistent organic pollutants', 'prediabetes', 'pregnancy', 'red meat', 'reproductive health', 'seafood', 'tuna', 'vaccines', ""women's health""]","How many months does it take to clear 99% of the mercury and other industrial toxins from one’s body, and what role might our fat stores play in holding on to fat-soluble pollutants?","Mercury vs. Omega-3s for Brain Development is the study about balancing risks and benefits.I explored how long it takes to get rid of some of the other pollutants in How Fast Can Children Detoxify from PCBs?

Greger ;) I much appreciate Sebastian. CheersI’ve started eating olives, because my BP went down too far on WFPBD and I was getting presyncopal symptoms. Are any of the following constituents, commonly seen in olives, harmful?-sodium alginate -guar gum -calcium chloride -potassium sorbate -lactic acid -citric acidI would not trust Guar Gum, it’s usually GMO. Depends how much salt is added too (potassium sorbate), Lactic acid comes from milk and is not good for you. Sodium Alginate (E401) is extracted from brown seaweed, not sure if that is good or bad. Calcium chloride I am also not sure about. Not sure where the olives are?I will look into organic olives. The problem is their price and the fact they are not available in bulk (here). If worse comes to worse, I will simply consume table salt and give up the olives entirely.Why would you consume table salt? Just go to a farmers market, they will have loads there I am sure, probable taste better too, nice and fresh.You should eat very little to no salt. Most people get way to much salt in their diet. You should make sure your salt intake is low. And more inline with nature, and where you would get salt from. As in food.I am also sure if you don’t know any farmers markets that you can find some olives not in liquid. Or with next to no crap added to them. Just look at the different brands.If you’re blood pressure is too low eat more nuts and seeds. Chia seeds and flex seeds are good sources of Omega3, and walnuts are not bad either, but higher in omega 6 but it depends how much fats you eat whether you need to worry about omega 6.Be weary of potassium sorbate. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-potassium-sorbate-bad-for-you/Having low blood pressure can be a result of other factors and not necessarily low sodium. Sodium needs for humans are extremely low. The bare minimum one needs for survival is around 130 according to the NIH. Of course excessive sweating will raise this but not an incredible amount. A safe limit of salt is 1500mg or lower.Toxins, my BP has gone down after going with a WFPBD, and I am extremely lightheaded immediately upon standing for a sitting or lying position. I calculated my 24 hour intake of sodium chloride to be well under the 2300 mg recommended in the latest IOM report – in fact, it’s more like 300-400 mg per day. As soon as I “salt-loaded” with olives, I felt immediately better. The dizziness and cognitive dysfunction are now a thing of the past. I think this speaks to the great variability in sodium needs between individuals. A WFPBD just does not contain a lot of sodium, since more than 80% of sodium arrives at the table in the form of processed food, and about 20% is added from the salt shaker (and I was not doing either of these things). Of course, for a hypertensive individual, sodium chloride needs are a lot lowly – closer to the 130 mg per day that you quote, and certainly under 1200 mg per day is best.D.H: I’m not a doctor or expert in any way, but I had a thought for you. I had a co-worker who went vegan (whole plant foods) and started feeling shaky and weak. After talking to her about her diet, I thought she might be a bit low on calories. So, I suggested she add nuts/seeds/avocados. that fixed her problem.The reason I thought of this when I saw your post is that olives are so calorie dense. So, is it the salt in the olives that made you feel better or just that you were getting some much needed calories? If that’s the case, then you would have more options on what to add to your diet to fix the problem (ie, not just olives).As I said, I’m not a doctor, so my thought may be completely off base. Just thought I would share the idea in case it is helpful.Yes they are calorie dense but it is the salt that saved me. I could do table salt instead. My peacounter tells me I am getting less than 300 mg of sodium per 24 h intake without addition of a salt source, and thus getting extremely lightheaded upon standing. Feeling ‘grayed out’ and unable to tolerate my normal exercise regimen. Adding olives fixed all this.If you have a healthy diet there aren’t any worries about taking salt, see here Dr Pam Popper commenting the results of the latests studies:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvCxTm-aA3QWe do need salt, otherwise you would have an imbalance too much potassium vs sodium, which might land you in hospital.I use Trader Joe’s Greek Kalamata Olives. The label only lists olives, water, salt and red wine vinegar. Am I missing something?why would anyone ever eat something with this stuff in it? I would’t even question your curiosity if I were you. Find olives that don’t contain this stuff. They are available.Low BP (lower than 90 or 60) can be a sign of serious illness. Eating olives may not be the best plan. The only thing I would be concerned about in your list is potassium sorbate. It harms fungi. I can’t say if it is harmful in humans. Please let us know how you make out with your BP…would you care to tell us what it is?White coat (public environment) systolics of around 100-106 mmHg, but much lower at home, and of course with standing up, even more drops.I meant to say that bp lower than 90 DIASTOLIC or 60 SYSTOLIC is considered LOW by the professionals. The symptoms you describe may be serious and you should see your GP about it. Best wishesHow about mollasses, then? If I recall you had a video pointing it out along with honey as the healthiest source of tea-sugar, due to nutrient contents. But is there anything bad coming out of the Maillard reaction in mollasses? Blackstrap has a reputation for some as a health food, so the question may be somewhat important.This gets me wondering about Liquid Smoke. I’m sure it is not an optimal condiment, even if I can find one without caramel color. The one I have does have caramel coloring (water, natural hickory smoke flavor, vinegar, molasses, caramel color, and salt). What the heck is “natural liquid smoke flavor” anyway? Not only is it the product but it is also an ingredient in the product. I’ve avoided this condiment in the past but recently bought some after seeing, in a video, Chef AJ use a capful in a batch of split pea soup. I’ve been having a hard time getting some of the no-added-oil/low-fat, low-sodium, refined-sweetener-free, plant-based recipes to taste appealing, which is why I bought the Liquid Smoke.There have been many studies on levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like benzo[a]pyrene in liquid smoke. The maximum seen in commercial liquid smoke preparations hovers around regulatory limits (1 ng/g in the EU). It appears to be a rather small dietary source compared to high heat cooking methods and fats. From this review:Chemical analysis of foods shows that flame-grilling can form both PAHs and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA), and that frying forms predominantly HAA. With detection limits of about 0.1 ng/g, amounts found in commercially processed or restaurant fooods range from 0.1 to 14 ng/g for HAA, and levels of PAH up to 1 ng/g in liquid smoke flavoring. Laboratory fried samples have greater amounts of PAH, up to 38 ng/g in hambugers, and high levels of HAA, over 300 ng/g, are mesured in grilled chicken breast.JD: Keep looking around for different brands of liquid smoke. I found that my local health food store had a brand of liquid smoke that contained all the extra garbage (sweetener, color, etc) that you list above. Then, to my surprise, the brand of liquid smoke at my Fred Myer contained nothing but liquid smoke. Win!Sometimes that bit of liquid smoke in a dish really makes the dish. I don’t use that much of it or all that often. Thus: It is one ingredient I’m not willing to give up! Just my personal thoughts on the topic. Good luck.How does one know that ‘natural flavor’ or ‘color’ is necessarily garbage? Isn’t that a case of “guilty until proven innocent” with what one is eating?DH: There is quite a bit of evidence that many of our “colors” are indeed harmful to us.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-harmful/http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-coloring-in-fish/Most people consider sweeteners to be junk food. There might be some saving grace for say black strap molasses, but does anyone really consider it a health food? Something to poor straight on your veggies? I don’t. Not that I don’t eat plenty of sugars, but I don’t pretend that they are good for me.When I purchase a product like liquid smoke, I expect the contents to match the label. The brand that I saw in my health food store had corn syrup in it as the sweetener. I wouldn’t be using much of it, but why have it at all? Especially when I can avoid it completely with a different brand.What about the salt? Most people don’t want salt added. They want to add it/control it themselves. Etc.When it comes to people and principles regarding people, I am a *firm* believer in innocent until proven guilty. When it comes to food, I take a more middle ground–especially when food companies in general have a proven track record of harming us with their products.That’s just my 2 cents. Everyone of course has their own approach to what they consume. I responded above because the original poster did not seem aware that liquid smoke could be purchased with out all the “junk”/extras.Could you look into this study about pesticides in tea leaves?

(also, might give you more time to think about the subject matter, rather than simply its delivery)My favorite interpretation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDeqc8sTLpcF is not a word!Luckily for you, “some women” (like your mother) aren’t as hypersensitive, and thus, you are here. To complain about “F”.How ironic.What the frell is “frak”?Leslie: I concur. This website is not the place for implied foul language. Let’s keep the focus where it belongs:exceptional nutrition and the research. Adrien: No judgement, just a friendly reminder for all of us.The comment to which I’m replying is the third, excluding my own eyes roll, that has nothing whatever to do with nutrition. “WTF” is an common expression all over the Web and in many instances, as in the initial instance here, there is nothing unkind or rude in its use.So let’s stick to nutrition rather than attempting to impose our linguistic preferences on others, eh?This will be my last off-topic comment in this thread.And that no BSIf you want to keep the focus on nutrition and research, you fail miserably by posting only to criticise somebody else speech, saying nothing about either nutrition or research in the process.It’s really not appropriate for you to go through life just waiting for your next opportunity to be offended by nothing.Sorry if I “ruined” someone’s day. But I find it difficult to believe it. I’ll be more careful in the future. A future where we can no longer say “Oh my god” or “For christ sake”, since it can offend some people. Beside, it was not my will to offend any, and I think everybody got it. I just use it as a way to express that I was shocked by the fact that another mammal’s urine got a substance that can enhance our immune system, and figure it out how it happened from an evolutionnary perspective. Further more, my original comment was – I beleive – like the end of the video, on the humour side. Maybe it’s totally inappropriate or maybe it’s my poor understanding of the english language, but I just don’t see why my statement can possibly be “very degrading to some women”, If it is, it should not, in my opinion. Hoping this answer will not trigger unnecessary debate. I whish you a good day and a life In Health. Adrien.Leslie are you serious? While “WTF” may not be cool in a scholarly journal, I doubt anyone would have noticed it if you hadn’t added the tempest to this teapot.Oh jeez Leslie, relax. BigFDeal if you get my drift. I thought when my wife got breast cancer last year it was F’d up, trust me. So there. That is why I am here on this site after meeting the man (Gregor) himself at Healthy Ventura with my wife and I going vegan on that date. Her breast cancer markers have been low to the point her doctor says her blood appears like someone who has never had cancer thanks to a healthy lifestyle and no chemo or rads. If you ever get cancer, you will see it is a pretty F’d up deal. Hopefully you won’t if you follow this great man’s advice. There are many more things in life to worry about than what comes out of people’s mouths or their fingers in this case. Be strong and quit eating meat and dairy. That’s your challenge for today.This is great. It reminds me of the kiwi DNA repair study. Speaking of which, is it the flesh of the kiwi, the skin of the kiwi, or the chewed up seeds of the kiwi that provide the beneficial aspect in the DNA repair? Or is it some combination? I didn’t pick up on an answer to this in any of the videos, and I find that most people don’t eat the kiwi skin nor grind up the seeds with there teeth.It reminds me of the plant vs pesticides video: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-vs-pesticides/Most people — true. But I like to eat the skin: I eat a kiwi as one would an apple, except I discard the ends rather than the core. I rinse it well first.Leslie could you refrain from using DNA – it’s offensive to some public servants who have been traumatised by the unregulated use of acronyms – I would feel safer if you used the full Deoxyribonucleic acid next time thanks.Ok. Normally when you mention a new food with health benefits is goes right into my morning blender. I have a feeling this one is going to be more difficult than Alma to find! :-)Who’s Alma? Where’s Alma?All you need to know.http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/amla/He was poking fun at your misspelling…oh…..my fingers are sometimes faster than my brain.I also responded with the same link. You can never tell with some members how serious they are!Amla is an extremely healthy berry. http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/amla/There is a revered tradition.Darryl: thanks for the link. Interesting but no way! :0)I know you like being on the “Leading Edge”/but this one is about as far out there as you tend to venture. Suggestions for where to get this great item and in what form/and to consume how much? And when? This will take some time to “digest” :-)Detoxification? Sounds like a job for the Nrf2-mediated Phase II response (activated by many phytochemicals). And sure enough, Ahr is acting at least in part by upregulating Nrf2 (1), and some important cytoprotective genes have both XRE (for Ahr) and ARE (for Nrf2) promoter sequences (2). Seems Ahr is the transducer for planar aromatics, whereas canonical Nrf2 induction via Keap1 detects electrophiles (3), a neatly evolved integration of xenobiotic detection to generate common stress responses.Darry, you are incredibly knowledgeable about nutritional biochemistry and physiology. I wish the evidence for nutritional research included more Level 1 evidence (large randomized trials with hard outcomes like the PREDIMED trial). It is difficult to know how well these basic science findings translate at a causal level in real people without the benefit of large randomized controlled trials.RCTs are a gold standard, but expensive, and I believe funding will grow ever more difficult for non-drug trials. My hope for better epidemiological evidence lies with larger health-oriented vegan or near-vegan cohorts in the general population, and developing world cohorts who retain traditional diets while benefiting from modern sanitation and vaccination.We’ve known for 30 years that cruciferous vegetables are chemopreventative for cancer. Basic science is throwing out numerous plausible explanations, but I’m not sure there’s a lobby big enough to fund the definitive RCT (hello David Murdock).There was an interesting editorial in Canada’s national newspaper today with the headline “99.9% of nutritional research is garbage”. I couldn’t agree more. I tune into Dr John Ioannidis (sp?) and his views that so much of biomedical research is pure bunk. Without RCTs, we will never know what is fact and what is fiction. Instead we are called to embrace an ever greater creed called “nutritionism” based on basic science alone in our ever more orthorectic ways of eating.The fact that molecule A kills mutated cancer cell line B in vitro means absolutely nothing in comparison with what 100,000 people eating food containing molecule A (along with a couple thousand other molecules) for five years do, in terms of development of that type of cancer, versus 100,000 people who do not eat food containing molecule A (along with a couple thousand other molecules). The former is a fallacy, the latter is real science and I’d argue unachievable in today’s current trial climate. But PREDIMED lights the path towards best research practices in nutrition, flawed as this trial may be. And self-reported FFQ’s are hopeless, as Archer has recently pointed out.I understand what you mean, but we will probably not see many RCTs on plantbased diets. There are many reasons for that: They are expensive, very time consuming, no pill to sell, a trial will take many years if you want real hard endpoints – death, cardiovascular event, cancer – and not accept surrugate markers, compliance to a plantbased diet could be a challenge compared to popping a pill and a vegan diet is not enough – it has to be WFPD. There are a lot of epidemiological evidence suggesting that a plantbased diet is the best diet for humans, and epidemiological evidence involves real people, living real lives so there are a lot of usefull information in epidemiological studies. I know, it is not RCT. Personally (based on our current knowledege) I am convinced that a diet primarily based on vegetables, fruit, legumes and starch is the optimal diet, but of course one can always argue that I am a fanatic orthorectic doc, but on the other hand I also say, that there are not enough evidence to say that a 100% plantbased diet is better than a 98% plantbased diet – I dont think that an occasional piece of cheese or chicken will kill ya. Unless you get food poisoning…Well, I got food poisoning from kale – it was either a nasty GI bug or intestinal angioedema with profuse, watery diarrhea and tenesmus lasting 5 days. Remember that the field workers that often pick our crops – and this sounds elitist – often have conditions like hepatitis A and may not have the best bathroom hygiene. Most of the produce in Canada seems to come from Mexico. I am slowly moving towards organic but I doubt this will fix the problem.I kinda agree with you except for the starch part. Having had significant metabolic syndrome (with 3 or 4 of the major NCEP criteria out of 5), limiting my starch has dramatically improved this condition as well as all the associated risk factors (BP, lipids, visceral weight/waistline). I know people advocate for 80% starch-based diets but I am big time into complex carbohydrates to the greatest extent possible (meaning soluble and insoluble fiber). I don’t consider starch to be a complex carbohydrate – maybe I need to be corrected here.Ornish did an RCT of a vegan diet with both hard outcomes (coronary events) and surrogate markers (degree of coronary stenosis in %). It was a very small trial but still published in high-impact journals (Lancet, JAMA). The Lyon Heart Trial in 605 patients showed dramatic reductions in CV events – Lancet and Circulation. The St Thomas Atherosclerosis Regression Study (STARS) with a very low fat diet showed dramatic reductions in both hard events and coronary stenosis (Lancet). It was a very small study (<200 patients, if I remember correctly, with 3 arms). But dramatically positive. Of course, PREDIMED with about 6000+ patients published in NEJM with a mean follow-up of just a couple years.If all the gurus got together and approached NIH for funding, a trial on the order of the Women's Health Initiative low-fat trial could be done, probably at a fraction of the price, greater compliance, with shorter follow-up. Remember that was a $400,000,000 trial that failed, in 48,000 women followed for a half-dozen years.How do you go about advocating plant-based diets to your patients? Do you use a handout? If so, would you mind emailing it to me at dhackam@uwo.ca.Many thanks DanDan, Thanks for your answer. I work in a tertiary center and my patients have not diet-related diseases (as far as I know!). Regarding the starch, I mean the healthy ones: Brown rice, barley, quinoa, rye-bread. But I confess to eat potatoes and white rice (aaarrrrggghh!). Agree, if one have metabolic issues it has to be complex carbs. Are you a G.P.?Clinical pharmacologist specializing in vascular medicine patients. I too am in tertiary care. And ALL of my patients have diet-related diseases (as did I, and still do, to a certain extent, whenever input of calories exceeds output of calorie expenditure).Kale and collards, while especially nutritious when grown by the organic method, are very high in pesticides and herbicides grown by conventional agriculture.Herbicides are mineral chelators and according to retired Purdue professor Don Huber. they bind the minerals in the soil and make them unavailable for plants and the animals/people who eat the plants. Listen to the video at: http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/12/10/dr-don-huber-interview-part-1.aspxOk, you convinced me, i’ll eat even more veggies than i already do. ;-)So, where can I buy this camel urine? Amazon?Good Question! I was about to ask that too. And does the good Doctor consume this product? Recommendations for amount and frequency. Best Alternatives?Dr. Gregor has made many videos that justify my decision to eat only plant-based food products, but this one may be the most compelling.Anyone selling a camel…..?Who would’ve thought to test camel urine? And who drinks camel urine?A plant based diet of dark leafy greens, onions, mushroooms –vegetables–berries (fruits) maintains more healing properties than eating dioxin which accumulates and concentrates in the fat of animals.Who would drink the urine of camels? Those dying of thirst on the deserts of Africa.Dear Dr. Greger,I prepare the green or white tea that I drink (daily) by soaking teabags in a clear glass pitcher of unheated (cold) water. My concern is that the fluorescent bulbs that I use in my kitchen might be causing a deterioration or loss of valuable phenols, flavonoids, and antioxidants in the tea.Are you aware of this issue? Please tell me if there is some nutrient loss in the tea due to artificial, fluorescent light.I appreciate your time and thought on this matter.Thank you.Thanks for all the great information here! Your site is regular affirmation that my WFPB diet is the right choice. QUESTION: Any studies on how a WFPB diet can help treat restless leg syndrome? It runs in my family. Thanks again, Dr. Greger.science found out just recently but prophet Muhammad s.a.v. has recommended as a cure for some people. But not every camel, the camels that are eating naturally not the feeded ones.I was laughing so hard about telling ones’ kids that it is either veggies or camel pee!!!! Hahaha I love your videos sir :)Is gluten really healthy for you? A lot of people I know recommend to not eat it.Please see Dr. Greger’s videos here. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-gluten-bad-for-you/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-gluten/Found these in the times section called “Room for Debate” and provide interesting counterpoint for investigation, discussion, and developing and refining further insights.http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/04/17/is-veganism-good-for-everyone/a-choice-with-definite-riskshttp://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/04/17/is-veganism-good-for-everyone/the-jury-is-still-outhttp://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/04/17/is-veganism-good-for-everyone/meat-is-brain-foodAny videos on fluoridation of water and also fluoride in toothpaste?","['Ah receptor', 'animal products', 'apples', 'beans', 'beef', 'breast milk', 'breastfeeding', 'broccoli', 'cancer', 'chicken', 'cruciferous vegetables', 'dairy', 'dioxins', 'fish', 'fruit', 'immune function', 'industrial toxins', 'meat', 'onions', 'persistent organic pollutants', 'phytonutrients', 'plant-based diets', 'pork', 'poultry', 'red onions', 'red wine', 'seafood', 'smoking', 'tea', 'turkey', 'vegans', 'vegetables', 'vegetarians', 'wine']",Phytonutrients in certain plant foods may block the toxic effects of industrial pollutants like dioxins through the Ah receptor system.,"What is this Ah Receptor thing?

Global numbers are much higher, though estimates are difficult to assess because neurocysticercosis is most common in impoverished areas with poor public-health systems. Nash estimates that anywhere from 11 million to 29 million people have neurocysticercosis in Latin America alone.re: “try not to laugh” Can I giggle in the privacy of my own home? ;-)Real life story. I work at a seafood restaurant. With my severe discount, it was pretty standard for me to eat wild Copper River salmon 3-4 times a week, seared to a beautiful rare to medium-rare. This was standard practice for about a year, year and a half.One day, I get severe constipation (at the time I was quite regular and regularly ate salads and veggies, as well as animals), this lasted about four days. I decide to tackle the problem with Dulcolax (some kind of laxative). I take two, no immediate recovery (here in America, we demand results, not excuses), so I pop three more. Problem solved! I was painting the toilet in no time!Little did I know the strength of these little pills. I had severe diarrhea for 3 days… Like 8-10 times a day. I was really concerned about dehydration, and the violent bowel movements were really wearing me out physically. I tried to lay low for a bit.Day three, I decided to continue on with my life (after visiting the bathroom four times that morning). So I go shopping at Sam’s Club (with my parents lol…) and the debilitating-punch-to-my-gut feeling returns, by this point, I’m familiar with the routine and know what’s in store. I excuse myself and brace for the pain in a well stocked bathroom stall. Like clock work, the janitor is going to have their work cut out for them.–Disclaimer, it get’s a bit (more) descriptive here..–But this time was different, after finishing, there appeared to be a long piece of lettuce hanging about six inches out of my anus, I’m a bit confused to see anything resembling food after 20+ bouts of explosive diarrhea over the last few days. “Whatever, grab a fist full of TP and pull it out,” I think to myself.I kept pulling it out, gently, replacing my toilet paper hand armor as necessary. I managed to extract about three feet before the “lettuce” became taut like a shoelace and snapped apart.I watched in the reflection between my legs in the water of the toilet (you know what I’m talking about, don’t play coy), as the “lettuce” proceeded to slither it’s way back up my asshole. I was hopeless, I couldn’t maintain any kind of grip on the slimy bastard as it proceeded to violate my derrière and flee to the safety of my innards.One can only imagine my horror when I realized it wasn’t a rib of romaine.I’m not a total idiot (although, in retrospect five dulcolax is pretty stupid), and coincidently I had recently heard about this new trend diet called the “Tape Worm Diet” where people voluntarily infect themselves with tape worms to reduce their caloric intake. It doesn’t take a rocket surgeon to connect the dots. “Mother F’er, I got a tape worm!” I lamented to myself.I knew “Wall-e” (since Sam’s Club was a part of Wallmart, and Wall-e is just a great movie overall, seriously, check it out), as he had become to be known, had won this round. I exit the stall, defeated, a broken man, face paled, covered in sweat and fear; I looked like I had witnessed a murder.My parents immediately noticed my distress, “What’s wrong Scott? Are you okay?” they inquire.“Mom… Dad… I think I have a tape worm. I named him Wall-e” They don’t believe me. I proceed to describe the story, they laugh at me. My parents are awesome.As a young, uninsured, bachelor, college drop out turned musician of Generation, I knew there was only solution…. le interwebz. Hours or googling and research, I learn all about tape worms, the different kinds (fish, pork, beef), their overall anatomy and risk factors involved. Given my dietary choices, I was convinced Wall-e was a fish tapeworm.Some good news, some bad news. Good news, the internet says the fish tapeworms are the least likely to leave the intestines and party down in the rest of the body (much like the pork does), bad news, these bastards can grow to be over 30 feet long! I learned that they tend to anchor themselves in the small intestine and cover as much surface area as possible to maximize their nutritional absorption. The laxatives must have really shook Wall-e up and peeled him off the walls of my small intestines and swept most of him away in the sh*t storm.I have my diagnosis. Now enter the beauty of the international latticework that is the internet. I managed to get an “online diagnosis” from a doctor in Asia (granted, I had to do a bit of homework… here what I have, here’s the meds I need, sign on the dotted line and I’ll give you twenty bucks), and a pharmacy in Turkey that would accept the prescription. It only cost me $50 for everything, diagnosis, meds, and shipping. See, being uninsured isn’t so financially debilitating.Long story, even longer, the US postal service lady comes to my door a couple weeks later with a sketchy package from Turkey half expecting it explode half expecting to give her ricin poisoning. I tear the package open. The meds have some fancy, 28-syllable, pharmaceutical name and they’re made by Bayer brand, good enough for me, what choice did I have after all.Google research told me that there are a couple different kind of tapeworm killer meds, one paralyzes the worm and you crap him out whole, the other removes the protective coating on the worm that keeps them safe from digestive juices.I was praying that I had the former of the two. If Wall-e was to be my first offspring, I wanted him in his full glory when I sh*t him out! I popped a couple dulcolax (I didn’t want to put up a fight lol..), wait a couple hours eat one of these meds. They’re about the size of a Tums, you chew and swallow them. They taste kind of like vanilla, surprisingly satisfying actually.Again, like clockwork, painful cramping of projectile diarrhea looms it’s ugly head. The showdown begins… man vs. worm. I grab a bucket from the garage, some latex gloves, and queue Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture with the volume set to 11. This will be the best Facebook photo ever.You can imagine my disappointment when the bowl was filled with tapeworm confetti. “Oh well, I’m glad that sh*t is over,” I sigh. Wall-e was no more.I spent the next week trying to convince everyone I knew they had worms and to eat some “vanilla worm assassins”. Apparently, I was the only one with a Wall-e.This experience began my odyssey into the world of nutrition, health, wellness and fitness. A long chain of events that opened my eyes to the corruption and the pathetic state of our food system. Through links, facebook pages, references and conversation I finally discover nutritionfacts.org. An absolute God-send in a sea of misinformation, lies, oppression and deceit.Dr. Greger, if you read this, I’ve learned SO much from your website. I can’t even begin to describe let alone thank you enough for inspiring me to take control of my health and elevate myself above all the fucking bullshit that is pumped into our brains and onto our dinner plates. Although, I’m not 100% plant based (yet) thought I’ve eliminated the majority of animal based food from my diet.I’m sure you can’t even begin to quantify the countless number of diseases you’ve helped prevent, lives you’ve helped save through prevention and proper nutrition. You’ve changed my life, and subsequently I’ve been been reaching out to friends and family, emailing links and preaching the perils of hot dog cigarettes.I’ve motivated my parents (my mom is a two time colon cancer survivor) to start drinking a veggie/fruit blend every morning. She has, in turn, motivated my obese brother to take control of his health and put down the chicken wings and booze. It’s not an overnight change, but a lifetime journey. I also have my girlfriend on board (she can’t cook worth a damn so she eats whatever I put in front of her.)I’m in the best shape of my life. I feel happier, healthier, and younger than than I ever thought possible. Every day it gets better and this is only the beginning of my journey! You and your website were the catalyst for my life style change. Your facebook link to Rich Roll’s online video series was the final straw. I bought a vitamix the next day.I would say I love you, but the internet is already a creepy enough place :P. Take care and keep saving lives!WOW! Once I started reading I couldn’t stop. What a story Scott! I am glad you managed to rid yourself of the tapeworms although it was in a sketchy fashion. Keep up the plant based eating and if you have any questions, Dr. Greger, myself, or other NF Team members will gladly assist you. What a fantastic story!hilarious! great stuffThe reasons to go plantbased are various, but this is one of the more entertaining! This scary story must convince even the most hardcore meateater…Oeeww, my sphincter just slammed shut. Ever hear of epazote?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphania_ambrosioidesHoly **** what a story! If I weren’t already vegan, this would be enough to make me never go near fish again. Also I have to say you have quite a gift when it comes to writing. Impressive that you could make a horror story that hilarious.Scott R: You have a future in comedic writing. Wow.Thanks for taking the time to share all this with us. I’m glad you found the site!Hi Scott! Consider standup comedy. Really :)Wow, what a story. Hilarious but I’m going to have to investigate this. I was raised with a dad who passed on very bad diet habits including the hot dogs and pretty much no vegetables other than corn and potatoes. I did give up all pork products completely a few yrs ago and have been trying in the last yr to find ways to cut things out that I’ve discovered are very harmful for you like hydrogenated oils and so on. It’s downright scary what I’m finding out is in our food and water! I try to share things I learn with my family and friends an FB and no one seems to want to listen. I keep trying though. Thanks for the post.Thanks for sharing. I’m happy for you. RIP worm.Oh my!! When I started reading I was wiped out from a long day at work…then I found my cheeks (on my face) hurting because I was giggling so much!! I lost it when I read, “and queue Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture with the volume set to 11″. Thank you so much for the excellent writing/story. I so enjoyed it!Thanks for the kind words everyone! This one just hit too close to home for me not to share. I’m glad you all enjoyed the story.OMG ! Glad I am vegan.Just taking this opportunity to say that Dr Greger’s stuff is the best information, on nutrition, on the planet – Up to date, based on science and delivered by an expert.And with great humor!Hilarious story! It reminded me of my own miserable experience during the holiday season, 8 or 9 years ago. I was not a vegan at that time, and did a lot of eating out at that time –.not only at friends’ houses, but also local restaurants. I had a “What’s that squiggly looking stuff in the toilet bowl?” thing going on. This annoying diarrhea lasted several months before I finally (embarrassed as hell when I turned over my BM specimen) saw a doc. She gave me some deworm pills, and it did the job. (I eat pumpkin seeds every day now; I read somewhere the little rascals don’t like them.)As an aside: Some years before that, I looked in the toilet bowl and saw something white attached to you-know-what. Huh? Turned out I’d scarfed down one of those stickers you see slapped on various fruits and veggies. Yeah, I could still make out what it said. :-)Oops, looks like I hadn’t edited this very well. Didn’t mean to write “at that time” twice in one sentence.I hate it when that happens. :-(So … how are they diagnosed and how are they gotten rid of? What should I request my dr do? thanksI think this link could help: http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/tapeworms-in-humansanyway worms infection normally do not show symptoms so if you think to have this nasty passengers in your bowel i think it’s better to talk with your doctor… problably he will tell you to collect some stools to make lab analysis…i was a suspect host. so after researching and talking to a “doctor” i optioned for D.E. Freshwater food grade Diatomaceous Earthworkshealth.com to be exact. after ingesting a heaping tbl spoon a day in about two weeks time i noticed a major improvement in my gut… less gas, constant gurgling sounds stopped, and all discomfort simply went away. no spaghetti in the toilet so probably not tapeworms. around the second week i did feel tired, exhausted some days. i guess when they die its a strain on your body but sooooo glad they’re gone. D.E doesn’t disturb your gut flora ( no pre-biotic/pro-biotic follow up) and all the side effects are health promoting! not to mention silica is ancient microscopic freshwater plants called diatoms …. PBWF too! well sort of. by the way i thought it was funny that the wise “doctor ” i spoke to is my vet for whom D.E. is a well know subject. if you got them so do your pets, stats show indoor animals increasing your risk as well. parasite screen is only $60 for fydo or whatever sample you may bring to the lab. http://youtu.be/nP4oQlqVlNk“Bean sprouts”? My mama always said, “Don’t wolf your food”. Chewing is an (obviously) essential step in human digestion. He did demonstrate another essential (but often neglected) last step of good digestion, a cursory stool assay. (A nutritional stool assay is also a good part of an annual physical, (also rarely done.))Should we former meat eaters get tested for worms? Or is there a simple protective measure like eating raw onion and garlic? My sister has migraines. What type of test should she get to rule out parasites? Thanks!I still am a meat eater, although I don’t feel OK, I fought some bacteria already, but I think I am still infected, I really would like to know what type of test should we get to rule out parasites :) Thank you","['aneurysm', 'brain disease', 'brain health', 'brain parasites', 'brain surgery', 'brain tumors', 'cooking methods', 'dementia', 'depression', 'epilepsy', 'eye disease', 'eye health', 'eye parasites', 'food poisoning', 'foodborne illness', 'headaches', 'inflammation', 'meat', 'migraine headaches', 'muscle disease', 'muscle health', 'neurocysticercosis', 'parasites', 'polyphenols', 'pork', 'seizures', 'sprouts', 'surgery', 'tapeworms', 'worms']",Chronic headaches such as migraines or “tension” headache symptoms may be a sign of pork tapeworms in the brain.,"I previously covered the topic of brain infections with pork tapeworms in my videos:Other parasites in meat include toxoplasma (Brain Parasites in Meat), sarcosystis (USDA Parasite Game), and Anisakis (Allergenic Fish Worms).

Why would they make the decision to go against this common knowledge?I don’t know the full answer to your relevant question, but here is one thought: The question of what causes heart disease may be subdivided into two different questions: 1- What physiological state increases the likelihood of heart disease? 2- What lifestyle choices promote the physiological state that increases the likelihood of heart disease?There will often be different types of studies and arguments to answer each of these two questions, which may contribute to confusing people.I was one of these people, before i got informed. my excuse to eat fatty foods was because something i read stated basically, “you need fat, your brain, nervous system and hormones are all made up by fats, without it you could not function”. So i took this as permission to eat all the fatty foods I wanted.6 mos ago i watched Forks over Knives and it changed my life. I am 100% plant based whole food diet now and have lost nearly 40 lbs (from 215 at my heaviest). That is all the evidence i need to keep eating this way for life.People like to hear good things about bad habits, and they insist on believing it despite the evidence. Its common knowledge that we have no dietary need for these 2 substances.According to the national academy of science, saturated fat has the unique ability unlike monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat to suppress LDL receptors which subsequently causes production of LDL. http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10490&page=432And from the Editor in Chief of the American Journal of cardiology, “As shown in ​Figure 1, most of the risk factors do not in themselves cause atherosclerosis…The atherosclerotic risk factors showing that the only factor required to cause atherosclerosis is cholesterol.” Figure 1: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603726/figure/F1/ Full text: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603726/Saturated fats also promote cardiovascular disease through non-LDL receptor related effects. A common saturated fat, palmitic acid, gives rise to the pro-inflammatory mediator ceramide, which compromises insulin function and promotes atherosclerosis. Similar effects are seen from diacylglycerol, another metabolite of saturated fats. And saturated fats promote transport of inflammatory endotoxins through the intestinal wall.Thanks for the additional information! I am particularly interested in the pro-inflammatory effects of saturated fats in the diet.However, just lowering cholesterol with statins does neither halt nor reverse progression of atherosclerosis.Veganrunner, You are right. People can say that they dont care, that they have great insurance,they rely on medication, the surgeon or take the change etc, but claiming that meat, eggs and dairy are not harmfull is complete nonsense, and ignore the bulk of evidence. Satuated fat and cholesterol in our diets are not only unnecessary, but also harmfull. I have seen no reliable data suggesting anything else.Veganrunner: Sadly, there will always be “Flat Earth People” that will get more attention than they rightly deserve. A variety of societal factors conspire for this to happen. Evidence – over time – renders the fallacies and the promoters of them powerless and useless. Those of us who are informed with the truth about diet and its effect on good health must be diligent to influence others about the positive effects we have experienced. Sometimes by word, sometimes by deed.Dr. Greger,What do you think about high-fat vegan diet?To control my cystic acne I eat an extremely low-glycemic diet. Most of my calories come from nuts, flax seeds, sesame seeds, tofu, supplemented by small amount of seaweeds, mushrooms, garlic, kale, leeks. Once in a while I eat a small amount of fruits, mostly berries.All the nuts and seeds I eat means I consume a lot of fat. Is such a high fat vegan diet unhealthy? Or it is only high animal fat diet that’s unhealthy?All the literature I’ve been able to find seems to lump vegan and low-fat together. I can’t really find any study on high-fat vegan diet.A high fat vegan diet, even in the form of whole foods plant based, is not the most healthful diet. You can expect alot of omega 6 and saturated fat. Whats wrong with complex carbohydrates?I’ve been eating a high-fat vegan diet for 3-4 years now, and all of my blood test parameters are excellent. As long as one is getting all the nutrition he or she needs, and from appropriate sources, a little extra MCT or stearic acid is not going to be an issue. Also it doesn’t matter how much n-6 he’s consuming, as long as there is a proportionate increase of n-3, which he is probably accomplishing with the flax, sesame, and tree nuts.We cannot determine the healthfulness of this individual’s diet based on your interpretations of a high fat vegan diet. Tree nuts (excluding walnuts) and seaseme seeds are extremely rich sources of omega 6 and one can easily tip the balance of this delicate 4:1 omega 6:3 ratio.Concern also stems from the fact that it is difficult to heal athlerosclerotic lesions consuming a high fat diet, no matter what the fat is.A 2 year study looked at coronary artery lesions of the heart after consuming different types of fat. Polyunsaturated fat, Monounsaturated fat, and Saturated fat. They looked at angiograms a year apart after intervening with increasing one type of fat in each group. All 3 fats were associated with a significant increase in new atherosclerosis lesions. Most importantly, the growth of these lesions did not stop when polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats were substituted for saturated fats. Only by decreasing all fat intake including the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats did the lesions stop growing. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2407875Of course, the information must be put into context, as the diet of these groups was not the healthiest, but even so, the results are thought provoking and still may be applicable.Looking at individual fats tells us nothing about the effects of wholefoods. And the study you referenced has little bearing on a discussion for vegan diets; the study specifies it was testing fatty meats and dairy. Neither of these are vegan, so how can vegans extrapolate useful information from them?The fats in tree nuts and seeds come with a host of other beneficial compounds, many of which have been shown to ameliorate heart health. This would include high ratios of L-arginine (NO precursor), tocotrienols and tocopherols, magnesium, polyphenols (especially catechins and myricetin), and phytosterols, just to name a few. If you have any information showing that tree nuts and seeds worsen heart health, rather than help, please post here for us to read over.Coconut is also a high fat vegan food, but I have not ever come across and information linking whole coconut to problems with cardiovascular diseases. The MCTs in coconut don’t even have similar metabolism pathways as those of animals fats, so how can we arbitrarily class these together? Coconut is also a wholefood deal. It’s not pure MCT, it also has a very high fiber content, as well as a high phytosterol content.There is not sufficient evidence to start promoting low-fat diets for healthy vegans. In fact most of the benefits seen from promoting low-fat diets in non-vegans is probably from the fact that eating a low-fat non-vegan diet means cutting out more animal product.To repeat what I had said “Of course, the information must be put into context, as the diet of these groups was not the healthiest, but even so, the results are thought provoking and still may be applicable.”I am not saying that nuts are not healthful, and I am not saying that some coconut is fine. I would strongly disagree that a diet where the bulk of the calories are based on tree nuts and coconut is MORE healthful compared with a lower fat, complex carbohydrate based diet. Complex carbohydrates from beans, whole grains, potatoes, etc. has an array of nutrients including the ones you listed as well, and due to the lower fat content of these foods, it is easier to achieve satisfactory omega 6:3 ratios.In addition, coconut has medium chain fatty acids which are still not established to be quite negligible, and despite this, coconut still contains long chain saturated fats. Coconuts and nuts can be included in a healthy plant based diet but basing ones diet where the bulk of the calories come from these foods is not optimally healthy for the reasons stated. http://www.healthgrain.org/webfm_send/251I got into this online debate with a Paleo adherent who was saying that whole grains are always bad, because of the sugar content. He thought that nuts were fine. I said that both whole grains and nuts were good. I consume a big bowl of oatmeal everyday to get complex carbs and often I consume legumes when I am off from work. I eat a lot of nuts and pumpkin seeds and ground flaxseed as well. I tend to have a higher fat, higher complex carb diet, which the amount of exercise I do enables me to do both. I used to have very high cholesterol and was taking a high dose of statins. Now that I weigh 100 pounds less, my LDL is 95, HDL is 77, the total cholesterol is 182 and triglycerides are 48 without taking any medicine. Should I be concerned? I am all for both complex carbs, as well as fat from nuts and seeds- I don’t take any plant food off the plate.Toxins, thank you for sharing this. I think it is one of the most important group of words put together on this website.It is so easy (and fun) to eat a high-fat vegan diet, and just as easy to excuse oneself because it is plant-based. I, and I think others, needed to hear/read your words today.Again, the amount of useful data that can be extrapolated from a study testing the effects of meat and dairy on cardiovascular risk is approximately zero when we’re discussing vegans. There is zero evidence, I repeat, zilch, that whole plant foods that happen to be high in fat are bad for our health in any way.I’ll tell you what. I’ll donate $50 to the 501c3 here, if anyone can show me a single study (just one) that any of the following foods have any negative impact on heart health (or health in general):Olives Coconut meat Any edible tree nut Any edible seed Avocados CacaoOf course 4 of these 6 have been linked to being some of the best anti-cardiovascular disease foods known. The oldest lived individual in the world reported that she thrived off of the highest fat plant food – cacao. She passed on at the age of 122.Anyway, got my credit card ready here guys.You sound really really silly here, but for starters, you need to define some more specific criteria for a link. If a really old person eating cacao is a great enough link to insinuate that high fat cacao is great, then maybe the saturated fat in it is plenty to imply that it is terrible. Sat fat has been linked to heart disease and cacao has been linked to sat fat. Of course you dismiss this argumentative line, but if you are going to credibly get your credit card out you need to put out with intellectual honesty, too, something that actually implies that the mind behind the card is reasonably open to change.Dan, I am not “sounding silly” here. It’s called science. So let me explain.First and foremost, let’s recognize that in science, we use careful, controlled observation to prove something exist. We do not ever assume something exist and say that science has to prove it does not.In the context of our discussion here, this means that we must use science to show that a high-fat vegan diet is sub-optimal to a low-fat vegan diet, before we start promoting a low-fat vegan diet over a high-fat vegan diet. It also means that we do not suggest a low-fat vegan diet is healthier than a high-fat vegan diet, simply because science has not specifically proven false the idea that a high-fat vegan diet is equally healthy or healthier than a low-fat diet.Thus, the best anyone can say right now is that both low-fat and high-fat vegan diets seem to promote great health, and there is currently no data to allow us to decide if one has slightly more benefit than the other. I asked for anyone to provide information contrary to this, and if someone does, I will donate $50 to the 501c3, in the interest of applying science to human health, nutrition, and longevity.Secondly, when we organize studies, document them, and extract information from them, we are careful not to over extrapolate the information in ways that are not appropriate. In fact, the amount of definitive claims we can make from most studies are few and far in between, and the rest we say we need further study and research on.This means that because saturated fat as an unnatural, isolated nutritional factor, is causing health problems in test subjects, or that saturated fat intake associated with intakes from animal products is causing health problems, then we say that saturated fat as an isolate or as an indicator of animal consumption is strongly associated with said health problems.We then might say that we are interested to know if saturated fat found in plant foods (olives, edible tree nuts and seeds, coconut meat, avocados, and cacao) is associated with similar health problems (or any health problems at all) in the way that the saturated fats from animal products is associated with health problems.So at this juncture of scientific inquiry, we are unable to specifically promote a high-fat vegan diet over or under a low-fat vegan diet. At this juncture all we can say is that we are interested to know more, based on what we know we know (animal saturated fat kills), and based on what we know we don’t know (does plant saturated fat kill or heal).That being said, what evidence we do have on plant foods high in fats, especially saturated fats, is that they either have neutral effects on heart health, or grossly positive effects on heart health.In case anyone is interested to read, I’ll post some examples:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23150750(Cacao polyphenols and heart health, cancer, & diabetes and other metabolic disorders)http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20199998(Nuts, blood lipids, and cardiovascular disease risk)http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22720792http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22607645(Table olives, their phenolics and tyrosol-esters, and cancer and cardiovascular disease risk)It’s silly when you are mentioning the dietary habits of a single exceptionally old person. That’s of minimal weight in any scientific discussion that has data on whole populations, so I wonder why you lead with it. I also wonder why you aren’t directly answering the question about what would be a ‘legitimate’ study suggesting a link between olives and cancer. But it seems that for you a study of dietary components would be looking at the olive independent of its awesome olive-y context, while a study on populations might lump in olives with too much other context for your taste. So what do you need, an RCT in vegans? A retrospective study that specifically codes for olive consumption, what?Also, what is ‘edible’ in the context of your challenge? Bitter almonds and peach pits are edible in the sense that they find their way into the occasional batch of marzipan, but they have deleterious effects on health due to their high cyanide content and it is quite easy to eat to excess. Clearly in that context it doesn’t matter that cyanide is a mere component that may not have been adequately studied in special vegans, so why can’t we take, say, the acrylamide content of black olives as a stroke against their general healthfulness?The old lady eating chocolate was just a cute little anecdotal story. Of course we can not make decisions or draw conclusions on it that would affect the lives of potentially millions of people. When asked for further explanation, I posted one (of many) of the studies on cacao and it’s health implications.Edible in the context of my challenge means it should be fit for daily human consumption. So as you explained, this would rule out bitter almonds. Small amounts of hydrogen cyanide can be formed from many of the foods we eat, and our bodies detoxify them as need be. Most foods have components in them that need to be detoxified. But you have to look at the “whole deal” to see what you’re getting. In the case of bitter almonds, a single almond can have as much as 9mg of pro-hydrogen cyanide. The LD50 is as low as 50mg. So if eating 6 bitter almonds a day might kill you off by day two, then let’s agree it’s not fit for daily consumption, and we’ll place it in the “inedible” category.Okay, but how about the black olives? Fit for daily consumption, we could say, but shifting a high portion of daily caloric intake into black olives may not be the best choice over the long term. Are we really ruling out discussion of dietary components completely, and what about statistical comparisons between/among the dietary patterns of whole populations? For instance, if I were to produce a study correlating worse heart disease outcomes in Israel relative to other countries with their high consumption of high Omega-6 oilseeds like sunflower and sesame, would you have a reason prepared to dismiss the type of link that they are suggesting?Shifting a high portion of daily caloric intake into any one food would not be the best choice long term. Variety is just as important as the diet being plant-centric and whole foods based.Olives that have been naturally fermented, versus having undergone unnatural curing processes, lack the acrylamide content. So again, a point we can all fall back on and agree to, the closer to nature the better.I am not against the consumption of higher fat, whole plant foods, if in fact we are still discussing whole plant foods. I think people may confuse the data and adopt the same benefits to the oils of these foods which are well established to not be healthful.I also think its important to note that most studies where high fat plant foods replace calories or add calories on to ones diet, that person’s diet initially was not healthful. It is difficult to assign the same benefits of these foods to someone already consuming a diet comprised of low fat plant based foods. Perhaps there is benefit but perhaps also to a lesser degree considering that all whole plant foods have beneficial phytonutrient compounds.For example, English walnuts appear to be far more anti inflammatory than black walnuts most likely because of the high content of omega 3 and possibly other phytonutrients at play.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/black-versus-english-walnuts/I find Jeff Novick to be extremely insightful in regards to nutrition and these issues. If you are unfamiliar with Jeff Novick, he is a very important and well spoken plant based dietician in the WFPB movement. He is one of the most knowledgeable people I know and has scientific grounds for all of his statements. He runs a forum with Dr. McDougall and has a special section devoted to common issues people ask, including topics such as nuts, coconuts, and cacao.http://www.drmcdougall.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=7828Based on your responses, I assume that you have interest in understanding the topic fully and are looking for evidence based statements. I think you will thoroughly enjoy reading some of these topics Jeff Novick has shared.Wow, looks like loads of information to read over. Thanks Toxins!Aside from my other post, I do not know as much about the importance of omega-3 to omega-6 ratios. I mean, I know the basics of course, like n-3 being anti-inflammatory, with n-6 promoting inflammation if there’s too much of it compared to n-3.I wanted to read more about what ratio would be optimal, since I noticed my ratio is 2.5:1 according to cron-o-meter. Should I consider increasing my intake of omega 6?The lower the better, of course we don’t want to get too low or we may get side affects such as the inability to heal well from cuts and other hemorrhage type side effects. Your ratio is good, consuming 1:1 is by no means unhealthful.The ratio is important because of competitive enzymes that convert ALA to DHA and EPA and Linoleic acid to Arachidonic acid. Too much of either and you will not get adequate conversion rates. Unfortunately, most foods tend to be high in omega 6 which is pro inflammatory.At the very least one can say that at the present time there are no studies showing the effective treatment and reversal of heart disease or cancer with a high fat diet, whether plant based or animal.There are many studies linking the consumption of raw cacao (or the least, very dark chocolate) to drastic improvements in cardiovascular health. More than drugs have accomplished.And algae oil too. But supplements do not a high fat diet make.I would echo what Toxins said. In my opinion the glycemic index can be useful but it can add some confusion into the mix. It depends on what your goals are. For instance glucose is very high glycemic whereas fructose is very low glycemic. Starches which are complex carbohydrates are long chains of glucose. Fructose is metabolized primarily by the liver to uric acid, triglycerides, and inflammatory aldehydes among other things. By backing off the higher fat plant foods and adding complex carbohydrates you should get adequate calories. If you do change your diet it will be interesting to see what if any effect it has on the cystic acne. Good luck with the acne.Thanks, Dr. Gregor. Excellent piece.Freaking Scary!This is a very powerfull video. We are not only responsible of our own health destiny, but also the health destiny of our children. Atherosclerosis starts in childhood. I am NOT saying that children should be raised on a low fat vegan diet, but the parents have a responsibility to limit the amount of junk they put in to their children – limit the burgers, pizza, cheese, candy etc and increase the vegetables, fruit and grains. Actually my smoothie experiment is a succes. High amount of kale, broccoli, beetroot and a little ginger in the Vitamix with some fruit, and my son loves it – and now it actually tastes of blended vegetables. Adults have a choice – if they are fully informed (and insured!) and choose to die or get a heart attack in the burgerbar, so be it, but the children does not have that choice.Plantstrongdoc: Thanks for the follow up on the smoothies you feed your kid. That’s so cool that you are are creating a kid who truly has a taste for veggies. You are doing him a huge favor.Actually he likes brussel sprouts and light steamed broccoli (7 years old). I am trying to convince him to eat beans, but that is a little difficult….Ever try to make black bean burgers? I have made these before and they are really good! http://happyherbivore.com/recipe/quick-black-bean-burger/Although when I asked him in person, Jeff Novick told me we SHOULD raise our kids on a LFWFPB diet, but he recognized that it’s not easy, because of environment (school, peers, previous habits, etc.). We are more lenient with our 4 kids than we are with ourselves (not always low-fat, and sometimes less than whole food), but we do strive to keep their nutrition within Dr. McDougall’s plan guidelines as much as possible.This information needs to spread! Attend the North American Plant Based Healthcare Conference if you want to help others! Great video Dr. Greger. Looking forward to learning more…One of your best, Dr. Greger—had me spellbound. Thank you so much.“Dr. Lewis Kuller, a professor of public health from the University of Pittsburg from his 10 years cardiovascular health study made the following statement in April 2006: “All males who are 65 years of age and older who have been exposed to the traditional western diet have cardiovascular disease and should be treated as such.” ” As profound as the above quote is, it looks like the years of age may have to be revised downwards.I think this video in one of the most important that i’ve seen here on nutritionfacts.org …I presumably built up arterosclerotic plaques for most of 39 years (even in ovo-lacto-vegetarian years). Ornish and Esselstyn’s recommendation of a very low fat plant based diet is central to my personal program to reverse the dames, and has certainly helped with lipid profile and blood pressure. There are numerous other ways besides fat content where plant based diets help, and one that Dr. Greger hasn’t gotten around to yet is the central role of subclinical vitamin K deficiency in arterial calcification. In humans, supplementing with about 3x the RDA halves the rate of calcification, while rats, high K intake reverses arterial calcification.So where to we get vitamin K? Dark green leafy vegetables, especially parsley, swiss chard, kale, collards, mustard greens, and spinach, which all have more than 500 µg (3 x the RDA) in every 100g (about 1 ½ cups raw).What is wrong with people who deny this message? I talk about this all the time and yet, people seem to scoff and dismiss it. Having seen my father have a massive coronary at 46 and then die at 61, I want to change my health destiny. I have been plant-strong since April 2013 and in that time have lost about 30lbs and made a huge difference to my health. I am off to get my cholesterol tested again tomorrow – lets see how much it has come down by.If you want to follow my journey and to get some PLANTALICIOUS recipes – take a look at my blog – http://wp.me/p3EfqD-apNice Barry! Thanks for your post.Plant-based diet by all means. However, something being overlooked that is endemic and affects everyone, including very young children, is fluoride in municipal drinking water.

Should I be doing something to replace the EPA?Your body converts effortlessly between DHA and EPA as it needs. The problem is from getting EPA from ALA (the plant omega-3)I ran into someone today who went to a nutritionist (MD with specialization in nutrition) who was pro-vegetarian, but claimed to her patient that some people are not evolved to handle a vegan diet, such as the Inuit. Anyone have any research on vegetarianism and genetics? I don’t know if she was referencing the disproven blood type diet, but it was before the paleo diet came out.Scary but empowering indeed.Dr. Greger, I was wondering though if a very low cholesterol level could be a problem too for someone, like me, eating a plant based diet. I have a level of 95 total (not 195, but 95) and 50-55 HDL. Many people in my family have low levels, but no one like me, as I am the only veg*an.Now, I’ve read a couple of studies on Pubmed that suggest a correlation between low cholesterol and intracerebral hemorrhage. Any thoughts on this? Should I try to raise this level? How? Thank you so much.See here for low cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/can-cholesterol-be-too-low/Thank you, but that video seems to address only the correlation between low cholesterol and cancer risk, not low cholesterol and intracerebral hemorrhage as the mentioned articles on Pubmed do.There is no dietary need to consume cholesterol, so if it were to become abnormally low,this would be due to other physiological reasons, and not diet. http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10490&page=542Dr Greger, I thought this article of professional (and possibly dangerous) naivety in this British Cardiologist’s assertions (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24625808) that the role of saturated fat is dramatically overplayed might interest/terrify/dishearten you. I can understand why the role of sugar should be addressed more (pursuant to Dr Lustig’s work on the subject), however it appears damaging when portrayed in the media that saturated fat is someone deemed de facto healthy/acceptable by the medical fraternity, confusing the consumer more with mixed/mis-information.There is nearly 100 years of research showing that saturated fat and cholesterol are the causes of heart disease. Sugar has no part in forming athlerosclerotic lesions, and to think glucose, the primary fuel source of the body, will cause athlerosclerotic lesions is nonsense. This Meta-analysis looked at 21 different studies, and came to the conclusion that “there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of CHD or CVD [heart disease].”Studies like this one are misleading.Here is Jeff Novicks take on the matter.One major problem with this study is they did not look at any studies where the saturated fat intake was less than 7%, which is the level recommended by the American Heart Association. Most of the diets had saturated fat intakes in the range of 10-15% (or more).So, just like the studies that criticize “low fat” diets, but never analyze any diet that is truly low fat and based on the principles of low fat, high fiber, whole plant foods, this study criticizes the impact of lowering saturated fat, but never looked at any diet that truly lowered saturated fat to the level recommended.Another problem with the study is what the subjects replaced the saturated fat with when comparing the 2. For many, if not most, it was with either (or products containing) hydrogenated/trans fat, while flour, white sugar and/or mono fats.People who replaced saturated fat in their diet with polyunsaturated fat (omega 3/6) reduce their risk of coronary heart disease by 19 percent, compared with control groups of people who do not.http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000252Lastly, studies on all-cause mortality trumps findings for subsets such as CHD and CVD. Most all-cause studies demonstrate a direct relation between saturated fat intake and all-cause mortality and the lower the better. Here is a list of studies showing just this.“the results of this study support earlier observations that dietary intakes low in SF or high in FV [fruits and vegetables] each offer protection against CHD mortality. In addition, however, our data suggest that the combination of both high FV with relatively low SF intake offers greater protection against both total and CHD mortality than either practice alone.”http://jn.nutrition.org/content/135/3/556.long“The major finding of the present study is that the average population intake of saturated fat and vitamin C and the prevalence of smokers are major determinants of all-cause mortality rates. Saturated fat and smoking are detrimental, but vitamin C seems to be protective in relation to the health of populations…The potential effect of changes in saturated fat, vitamin C and the prevalence of smokers can be illustrated as follows. A change in saturated fat of 5% of energy is associated with a 4.7% change in age-adjusted all-cause mortality rate (Table 3).”http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/2/260.long“A high RRR pattern score, which was associated with high intake of fat and protein and low intake of carbohydrates, increased the risk of death. Subjects with a pattern score belonging to the highest quintile obtained on average 37·2 % of their energy from fat and 37·6 % from carbohydrates and thus did not meet current dietary recommendations (Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2002). Food groups that contributed to this unfavourable pattern of energy sources were red meat, poultry, processed meat, butter, sauces and eggs, whereas a high intake of bread and fruits decreased the pattern score.”http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBJN%2FBJN93_05%2FS000711450500111Xa.pdf&code=6fbdbd311fb43ee23a840b894cced959From the National Academy of Science:“Saturated fatty acids are synthesized by the body to provide an adequate level needed for their physiological and structural functions; they have no known role in preventing chronic diseases. Therefore, neither an AI nor RDA is set for saturated fatty acids. There is a positive linear trend between total saturated fatty acid intake and total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration and increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). A UL is not set for saturated fatty acids because any incremental increase in saturated fatty acid intake increases CHD risk”http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10490&page=422“The saturated fatty acids, in contrast to cis mono or polyunsaturated fatty acids, have a unique property in that they suppress the expression of LDL receptors (Spady et al., 1993). Through this action, dietary saturated fatty acids raise serum LDL cholesterol concentrations (Mustad et al., 1997).”http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10490&page=432From the editor in chief of the American Journal of Cardiology.“As shown in Figure 1, most of the risk factors do not in themselves cause atherosclerosis [heart disease]…The atherosclerotic risk factors showing that the only factor required to cause atherosclerosis is cholesterol.” http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603726/Obviously i was referring to the nefarious role of fructose at chronic consumption, inducing hyperinsulinemia; Leptin resistance; and metabolic syndrome. Sugar just happens to be the vehicle of fructose we have a particular penchant for in today’s society.Perhaps lumping artifical sweetners into the equation then yes, but fructose from fruits has not proven to have any ill health efects.Well Toxins, that’s an ill informed assertion. See Dr Greger on – http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sugar-vs-corn-syrup/ – and – http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flesh-and-fructose/ – Fructose is fructose whether it arrives at the liver from a can of coca cola or from your minute maid orange. The fundamental difference when it’s consumed as part of a whole fruit is the fibre, which regulates the absorption of fructose and how quickly and at what intensity it arrives at the liver. There fructose is not stored as glycogen (as glucose is) but rather is metabolised by the mitochondria, resulting in uric acid, and in its interaction with Junk 1 results in a disruption of the role of insulin at the liver and a need for the pancreas to send more insulin to the liver, leaving increased insulin levels all over the body. A hyperinsulinemia state can disrupt leptin signalling at the hypothalamus which can lead to consumption problems.Artificial sweetners don’t have fructose in them, so there won’t be the biochemical disruption that chronic fructose consumption induces at the liver (although there could be hedonic issues, and issues with stomach peptides).I recommend Dr Lustig’s seminal lecture on the role of fructose – http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oMExcuse me when I said “artificial sweeteners” I meant added sweeteners.The very point I was making was that when consumed from fruits, it will not be an issue for the implied reason that the fiber content slows the absorption and that whole fruits are more satiating then a food with added sweeteners so you would inherently get less sugar.I agree, the tide of fruit juice consumption is only compounding the fructose problem with the removal of fibre. This australian study differentiated clearly between whole fruit/vegetables and fruit juice in terms of colon cancer risk – http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21963014I have followed the Esselstyn diet for five years and have had significant reversal of arterial plaque (I am 68), from dangerous to mild-moderate. I have avoided oils almost completely during this time. However, I am aware that eating nuts or sunflower seeds would increase vitamin E intake and perhaps lower the risk of cognitive decline. Question, then: will the increase in fat from an ounce per day of sunflower seeds negatively affect arterial plaque? Esselstyn’s position on this is unclear to me.I have reduced dangerous arterial plaque through five years of the remarkable Esselstyn diet. I am 68, though, and also concerned about cognitive decline, so would like to increase vitamin E intake. But I am uncertain whether nuts and seeds, because of their fats, would be safe for me to re-introduce. I would not want to jeopardize the gains I have made through the diet.I would love to know who, exactly, found “By age 10, nearly all kids have fatty streaks in their arteries”.

This article is so on point, I cannot express how much, and how much really should be taken seriously not only by parents but by the U.S. FDA. The book Our Chemical Lives And The Hijacking Of Our DNA, A Probe Into What’s Probably Making Us Sick (on Amazon.com) discusses in detail what chemicals are capable of doing, where they are found, which consumers unfortunately don’t realize, and how they affect human health. Food dyes contain man-made toxic chemicals–and lots of them, too!, as you so correctly point out in the FDA-approved Yellow 5 example. Not only should food coloring chemicals be suspect for affecting brain function — and banned, I feel — but all neurotoxic man-made chemicals–regardless–that are so generously supplied in food, water, and the environment. I wish medicine would take seriously the problems man-made petro-chemicals, in most cases, contribute to the detrimental health and well being of everyone from prenatal status to senior citizen. Thank you for the work you do; it is a light unto accurate science and biochemistry.Of course not all chemicals are a problem but the range of manufactured chemicals in the US environment is really staggering. At least in Europe they have taken some positive steps like banning some chemicals such as cadmium and phthalates. The book, Exposed, goes through the issues. Unfortunately given our political structure in this country I believe we will continue to dance around the issue. The best path for us at this point is to avoid animal products as they are the leading source of persistent organic pollutants in the standard american diet. Avoid GMO’s which can be difficult. Buy organic plants when able and you can afford. Of course in the long run as we run out of oil and natural gas this all becomes academic… if interested in pursuing this line of argument I recommend, Richard Heinberg’s book, The End of Growth, or The Post Carbon Reader.In Europe it is a start banning phthalates in the production, but we still import a lot from China containing phthalates! I dont care about money or production, if the manufacturer cant prove that his product is not harmful, then ban it. Then they will come up with a solution – and quickly. But of course it is utopian – money talks.One of many factors in the 4-decade slide of the health status indicators propelling the US to the bottom among developed countries. Hence the stock expression, “US health disadvantage.” See http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=1556967&utm_source=Silverchair%20Information%20Systems&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=MASTER:JAMALatestIssueTOCNotification02/26/2013The artifical food colors being phased out in Europe include E102 (FD&C Yellow 5), E104, E110 (FD&C Yellow 6), E122 (FD&C Red 3), E124, and E129 (FD&C Red 40).The natural dyes European food processors are replacing synthetics with may do more than reduce ADHD risk, quite a few may have their own health benefits. Yellow curcumin (E100) from turmeric, yellow lutein (E161b) from kale, spinach etc., red/purple betanin (E161) from beets, and red/purple/blue anthocyanins (E163) from berries and red cabbage are currently being investigated for antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cancer chemopreventative, and anti-dementia roles.I could not agree more, skip all the processed junk food and be WELL. I’ve done it and at 67, I have blood pressure almost always below 120/70 and take no meds, exercise regularly and eat no sugar in any of its varius incarnations. At first it was hard to give up the meat, dairy, poultry, fish, cookies, etc but hey its so worth it. In my view YOUR HEALTH IS YOUR GREATEST WEALTH. Recomend a classic book regarding chemicals in food called “THE CHEMICAL FEAST” by The Ralph Nader Study Group on the Food and Drug Administration circa 1970. This book is an excellent intro into the political forces paid for by the large food and chemical manufactuers that have corrupted the FDA WAY BACK in the 1950’s. And it continues to this day. Anthony G. Environmental Scientist.The message is clear – avoid processed crap – vegan or non-vegan. Of course artificial crap has a negative impact on your body. We have to eat what we are designed to eat – fruit, vegetables, grains, beans (and a little alcohol :-) ) Some years ago I was horrified to learn that a common food dye, was also used in shoe polish! We have to protect our children and just say NO, when they want some crappy highly processed food, that dont even look like food anymore….. Of course you say NO if your children want to drink some gazoline, because it is not healthy, but if they want to eat or drink some crap, which will make them fat and sick in the future, we dont have the guts to say NO – thats what we have to change – because government in the US and Europe will not help us. This change will only come from the grassroots – us! Rember what Popeye used to eat to become muscular – spinach! What are Ninja Turtles eating – Pizza Pepperoni! Put a ban on commercials (candy, sugarloaded breakfast, fastfood) for children on TV. That could be a start.I will say that although no one should be eating cake every day, it’s very difficult to make red velvet cake without dye. None of the ”natural” dyes I’ve found has given good color, but maybe the high quality ones just aren’t available state side.Try using cochineal (carmine dye) made from crushed bugs. The Aztecs and Mayans used it to create beautiful reds and I drank it everyday in Europe for years as an ingredient of a grapefruit drink.Ewwwww. Gross. Not vegan. Thanks though.Well of course cake is fraught with all the baddies not recommended on this site – refined carbs, refined oils, and usually eggs or dairy – but have you tried beets? They are a natural dye that is quite good for you -http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pretty-in-pee-nk/ – and they will make the cake very moist!Hello Dr. Greger,This is a gem of a website and thank you so much for your beneficial work. I am wondering if there exists a concise general summary of all of your dietary recommendations for healthy adults who wish to remain healthy for as long as possible. This would be very welcome as there is so much excellent information on the website that is all spread out.Thank you,James MJames: I don’t know that this is everything that Dr. Greger recommends, (for example, it doesn’t mention flax seeds, which I believe are high on Dr. Greger’s recommendations. However, here is a blog post that is a high-level summary of Dr. Greger’s Optimum Nutrition Recommendations:http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/Hope that helps.Thank you Thea, that’s just what I was looking for!Dr. Greger, do you know of any studies concerning germinated brown rice vs regular brown rice? Thank you.The links above for tricks to get kids to eat healthier are expired. I’d love to see that info if it still exists.Buy pure natural ingredients and make foods yourself! Mac & cheese = whole wheat pasta, shredded cheese (maybe whole wheat flour) & milk. Add salt & pepper to taste. That’s it!Dr. Greger does not advise cheese or milk, and these foods are not considered health promoting for a variety of reasons. http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/Processed food is CRAP!!!Colored Rearranged And Packaged (notice the Acronym)for our consumption!Thirty yrs ago I read a book Dr Finegolds diet. He called for no artificial flavors or coloring in food. I made pancakes and waffles from Bisquick. At that time they came out with the first natural peanut butter and maple syrup. It was hard cooking dinner and making foods for a child.My Dr would not put my stepdaughter on meds. If she came home from school bouncing of the walls I knew she had candy or cake from someones Birthday Party. I noticed a big difference. I really believe there is something to the food and ADHD .Back then we did not have a lot of fast food.Great video, it’s amazing how processed our food has gotten and how acceptable this is as ‘normal’ parts of most people’s diet. As a dietitian I try to help my clients to reduce the amount of processed foods they eat and increase the amount of natural whole foods.

I’m so glad you asked–they’re my fave. The skin is so thin, you eat them skin and all so get all those rind phytonutrient goodies. My grandma used to have a kumquat tree that I have fond noshing memories of from my childhood.The produce guy at my local Whole Foods says that kumquats tend to be available in the winter.Is there any evidence that eating citrus or taking hesperidin alone may be helpful for those with Raynaud’s phenomenon?That’s exactly what I was thinking JB! Unfortunately, I’m not seeing anything: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Raynauds+citrusBummer!I’m excited about this finding. I also get cold hands and feet quiet often (I believe it is related to my Hashi’s). I am hoping that this citrus finding might help me get the blood flowing. However, I did a similar search as yours Dr. G on PubMed and found nada. :(Still, I’m going to try chomping on more oranges to see if I can sense a difference.Thanks for this interesting study find! Again, deeply appreciated!Great question JB. I’ve always had the ridges in my nails, but it wasn’t until I was an adult that the cold started cutting off the circulation in my fingers. The condition has gotten worse as I have gotten older and it adds an element of fear when I consider participating in outdoors events during the winter. (My doctor’s only help (which to be fair may be all that she had to offer) was to wear gloves – which does absolutely nothing for me.)I guess I’ll just have to eat a bunch of oranges this winter and see if it helps.Agreed that gloves are little help, sometimes even seem to make Raynaud’s cold fingers worse. Ample mittens, big enough to ball your hands up inside, work much better. My partner’s Raynaud’s used to be big trouble; but he’s had no finger shutdowns in the last few years, since taking to a plant based whole foods no added oil diet.JPotter: Thanks for sharing! I’ve been pretty close to whole plant based diet – though I do sometimes have oils in my diet. (Most of the time I modify a recipe to take the oils out.)I’ve also found that the best approach is to keep all the fingers together and curled up into a fist if possible. My approach has been to pull my hands inside my sleeves when I can. I often can’t make-due with mittens. I’m usually out with my dog and end up needing to have actual use of my hands/fingers fairly frequently. I can pull my hands in and out of my sleeves pretty easily, but it’s really not a great solution. Too often I still get the “progressive vessel collapse” (as I think of it).I’ve tried those hand-warmers with some, minimal, success.Thanks again for sharing.I use the curled up fist technique, as well.Feet are another animal altogether, though. At night, I try to warm my feet on my partner. He does not appreciate that much. So, sometimes I sleep with socks on.If time and circumstance allow, I take a hot bath; that seems to warm me up pretty good. If time and circumstance do not allow, I sometimes warm my hands under warm running water.re: unappreciated warming of one’s feet on one’s partner. Oh pish-tosh. What are partner’s for?re: running water: Yes, a huge help for me. What causes me concern is when I’m at a place like the beach (which gets very cold and windy here) and I can’t guarantee that I will have access to warm water. I worry about that sort of thing a lot. It’s been fine so far. I just worry. Of course, now I could down a few oranges/orange juice – but then I expect to have some bathroom problems. There’s never any pleasing me.“What are partner’s for?” Ha ha! That’s what I tell him. :)Yes, have to remember that part. Thanks. Going to start with one orange and test it out.Raynauds is a problem for me to, so hope the oj works too. As far as the ridges in the fingernails, mine have really improved since being on McDougalls. Keepin it preety tight. Whole only. Going for the healthiest possible outcomes.JB I will let you know if it works because my son (13 yo) has this problem of Reynauds phenomenon. It’s always worse when he eats dairy, or gets dehydrated which happens when he is playing basketball. So even though it will be anecdotal we are going to try and control the variables [eliminate all dairy (which he almost always does) and stays hydrated] and see if it (the orange) works for him.Your son eats dairy !? Is he smoking too !!!? :-)It’s rather a funny story. He doesn’t eat dairy a lot but we went camping last week and instead of camp grub we decided to go to a local Mexican food restaurant and get some food. So (in his infinite wisdom–at 13 yo) he decided to order a Cheese Quesadilla which he never eats and happened to be packed with cheese. He even stated to me, “Hey Dad look at this (pointing to the huge amount of stringy mucus–cheese) on his quesadilla and proceeded to eat all that cheese. Then after we went back to the camp he went with his friend down to the store which sold Soft-serve ice-cream about 20cm tall!!! He told me the next morning it was the worst night of his life! He woke up about 1am and had to run to the bathroom and had explosive diarrhea (visual in effect) that lasted about 20 minutes and for three more times that night. The next day his stomach was so upset that Pepto Bismol helped but he said I am never going to eat that crap again. Letting kids do what they want is the best lesson of all, rather than “brain-washing” them to believe what “we” already know! No, he’s not smoking–yet! ;-( At least that I know of.Interesting. I use orange essential oil in hand lotion on my feet on cold nights. I swear it keeps my feet warmer. Is that possible?Dr G, when is your show on Dr Oz going to air?How many oranges would one have to eat to equal 2 cups of OJ?Less than you might imagine. Hesperidin (and other citrus polyphenol) concentrations are highest in the peel, not the juice.Nogata, Yoichi, et al. “Flavonoid composition of fruit tissues of citrus species.”Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry 70.1 (2006): 178-192.Take a look at table 3 (peel concentrations) and table 4 (juice vesicle concentrations) and you’ll note hesperidin levels are higher by roughly 30-40 fold in the peel.Hi Darryl, I really appreciate your thoughtful and scholarly posts. Including orange peel in the diet is intriguing.I guess when comparing OJ with whole oranges on the basis of nutrient content, another potentially important variable is the fullness factor. Say OJ gives you half as much of an important nutrient than the equivalent amount of whole fruit but you can consume four times more OJ without feeling as full, then aren’t you still better off going with the OJ?Be careful with consuming citrus peel as it contains aromatic oils which can upset your tummy.We use orange and lemon “essence”…peel in foods all the time and the pith is where the bioflavanoids are. I have eaten it since I was a kid. Always liked it. Funny what some of us throw out as garbage.Is taking vitamin C supples as effective as eating or drinking the citrus?Why does blood flow increase? Caldwell Esselstyn describes blood flow and the role of nitric oxide. Any connection, do you think?Yes:Rizza, Stefano, et al. “Citrus polyphenol hesperidin stimulates production of nitric oxide in endothelial cells while improving endothelial function and reducing inflammatory markers in patients with metabolic syndrome.” Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism 96.5 (2011): E782-E792.I can vouch for this. I had a long history of cold hands and feet, even in the summer. When I went “raw”, I no longer suffered from bad circulation. When winter came and I ate some cooked lentil soup, my hands and feet got cold again. I thought to myself, “Deer live outdoors all winter…” so I went back to eating raw – especially dark green leafy vegetables – and my hands and feet grew warm again. Green leaves contain chlorophyll, which is only one ion different from hemoglobin. The structure of a leaf reflects the veins and vessels, capillaries in our bloodstream.Does grapefruit also have at least reasonable levels of hesperidin?Because (1)orange juice contains just as much of the flavanone polyphenol, hesperidin, and the carotenoid, beta-cryptoxanthin, as whole oranges and (2)drinking orange juice has been shown in studies to be substantially less beneficial to our overall health in many ways compared to eating whole oranges, we can conclude that the flavanone polyphenols and the carotenoids in citrus fruits aren’t anywhere near as wonderful as the phytochemicals found in allium vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, legumes, mushrooms, white tea, triphala, Korean red ginseng, psyllium, and wheat bran: http://www.inspirationgreen.com/assets/images/Food%20blog%202010/harvard%20weight%20gain%20study.jpgDoes the study mention whether the core gets colder as a result of the increased blood flow to the extremities? Since as you said, our bodies decrease the blood flow to our extremities to conserve heat, I worry that this might have an unwanted effect in that respect.I’m no expert, just a Raynaud’s sufferer. I have read that the extremities won’t warm up till the core is warmed up sufficiently. That answered my question about why, when I get this blanching or darkening, I have to turn all the heaters on and am completely frozen till I get warmed up “inside” and then and only then, will my fingers return to normal and then I can see why everybody else is saying “It’s hot in here.” Sowwy!Very cool and smart post.Has hesperiden been studied for cold urticaria (allergic reaction to cold)?Dr Greger..Thank yolu so much…So interesting. You didn’t mention whole oranges but, I can only imagine that it would be good. Less juice to the serving, of course. I have raynauds and this sounds like something I could use. For some reason I have stopped drinking oj and less whole oranges too. I think it is the fruit sugar/triglyceride/belly fat issue. Also I have a realated question that I’ve been wondering for a long time. Many people have told me not to eat the skins of oranges. Considering they are clean, I don’t understand that. I thought the best source of bioflavanoids is the pith of the orange. I have always liked it. Aaaand don’t we zest the skin of the orange for lots of uses? Can you direct me to some info? I’m trying my best to use whole foods and not rely in supplements which I don’t really think are good for us. Any info would be appreciated. Thank you, Dr. Greger for these great video’s and blogs. Much appreciated. LynnI get cold so easy, especially in my fingers and toes. Wow, this is just what I need. Citrus it is!I have been diagnosed with Raynaud’s some years ago and have been eating entirely plant-based for six months now. I feel much better in general, but while the Raynaud’s situation has not gotten any worse, it didn’t improve either.I tried taking a lot of citrus for a certain period, but it doesn’t seem to help much. I couldn’t find any more information specific to Raynaud’s on the website. I did some research for myself, and found that buckwheat is also a good source of quercetin, which supposedly helps, but alas, I have been eating it for a while but notice no improvements. I also found that caffeine has been believed to have a strong vasoconstrictive effect on the extremities. I also found that theanine, present in tea, ‘counteracts’ the caffeine. Yet I could not find any good information related to Raynaud’s or vasoconstricting/vasodilating effects of tea.Could you maybe point me in the right direction? The questions I have are: 1. Does caffeine / coffee indeed restricts blood flow to the hands? 2. Is this the same for (green) tea, or does the theanine counteract the caffeine (maybe there is even a small vasodilative effect due to the warmth that needs to be dissipated?)? 3. Did you maybe come across some more research that might help with Raynaud’s ?Thanks in advance!Any alternative treatments for Raynaud’s phenomenon (primary) worth trying? I’ve been following a healthy whole-foods plant based diets for around 5 years, but still experiencing cold hands and feet – even in the summer time.What do think about Magnesium supplements for this cause? Is it worth trying out? Are there any side-effects? Or perhaps there are some other supplements that might help out?Hi, I’ve read that Hesperidin is mainly concentrated in Citrus peel and albedo, hence I wonder if orange juice has, instead, a low concentration of such Flavonoid…Hmmm, since it increases blood flow, can citrus be a healthy version of Viagra??","['cardiovascular disease', 'cardiovascular health', 'citrus', 'cold hands', 'flavonoids', 'fruit', 'fruit juice', 'grapefruit', 'heart disease', 'heart health', 'hesperidin', 'juice', 'lemons', 'lettuce', 'limes', 'orange juice', 'oranges', 'phytonutrients', 'plant-based diets', 'quercitin', 'stroke', 'vitamin C']",Phytonutrients in citrus such as hesperidin may increase blood flow sufficient to warm the hands and feet of those with cold sensitivity.,"Because different families of fruits and vegetables can have entirely different phytonutrient profiles, variety is important.

So glad I can help!In health, MichaelGreat series in the month of Astrological Cancer!Great post… this info are really interesting…More amazing info, with numerous 2012 sources! Thanks Dr. Greger! Why isn’t this headline news everywhere? :( The silence of the press is deafening. This 4-min. video is further confirmation of William Li’s fantastic 2010 TED Talk, “Can We Eat To Starve Cancer?,” http://www.ted.com/talks/william_li.html.I can’t believe that being a vegan only reduces one’s chances of getting cancer by 1/3–or did I miss something?There are a lot of “junk-food” vegans. Also, there’s only one very large prospective cohort study looking at vegans specifically, Adventist Health Study 2, whereas EPIC-Oxford had a mostly ovo-lacto-vegetarian cohort – in both cases, the reference omnivore cohort was markedly healthier than the general population.I suspect veganism, per-se, is just one part an anti-cancer diet (reducing exposure of carcinogenic compounds and tumor growth promoters concentrated in animal products). An anti-cancer diet also needs to be low or moderate in complete protein and high-insulemic index foods (to reduce growth promoting IGF-1), and perhaps low in methionine specifically while high in fiber, phytochemical hormetics (to induce endogenous antioxidant responses and toxin removal), epigenetically active compunds (to reexpress tumor suppressor genes for induce cellular senescence or apoptosis), inflammation inhibitors, and antiangiogenetic compounds. Ie, Green tea, cruciferous vegetables, onions, berries, citrus, whole beans rounding out the calories, but not really the fake meats & cheeses or sweet desserts that ethics oriented vegans may be eating.Thank you! I will view Dr. Li’s talk. I know I am not, nor is anyone cancer proof, but my erudite opinion is that vegans have more of a chance, generally, to improve their odds against ever getting cancer, and I thought from previous studies, that the odds are well over 2/3ds against getting cancerThanks for your useful insights. In his talk, Dr. Li also raised an interesting point on how weight loss is associated with anti-angiogenic compounds. I wonder if this might explain the lower BMI of vegetarians and vegans relative to the general population. Do you have any thoughts on how fruits and vegetables should be combined in the diet to maximize synergistic effects for the prevention of cancer?Cao, Yihai. “Angiogenesis modulates adipogenesis and obesity.” Journal of Clinical Investigation 117.9 (2007): 2362-2368. is just the first of 40,000+ Google Scholar results for “angiogenesis obesity”. Adipocytes (fat cells) need a blood supply, too.I can’t claim any expertise in food combinations that potentiate anti-cancer effects The Nrf2 activating hormetins may prevent initiating mutations, while epigenetic modulatiors encourage transformed cell suicide or senescence and angiogenesis inhibitors starve larger tumors. For chemoprevention, these classes are probably all helpful, but their benefit will occur at different stages of disease progression.The plasma lifetimes of some important “nutraceuticals” like sulforaphane (cruciferous vegetables) or epigallocatechin gallate (green tea) are around 4-8 hours, but once they’ve activated transcription factors, levels of cytoprotective genes can remain elevated for days. So while continuous high plasma levels would require chemoprotective foods at every meal, that might not be necessary.I’ve seen studies that point to synergies from targeting a given signalling pathway like Keap-Nrf2-ARE with multiple compounds. Variety is probably important.Many of these beneficial plant compounds seem to serve the plants as pesticides (hence their concentration in the leaves and skins of fruit). Our ancestors evolved to deal with these exobiotic toxins with robust endogenous antioxidant and detoxification responses, and in their absence (eg, in a highly processed diet), our cells don’t get the expected cues to ramp up defenses. But, after a point, more is not necessarily better (see these videos on broccoli juice and green tea extract overdose). A variety of chemopreventative whole foods (rather than supplements) may keep dosing in the hormetic range.If you’re interested in multi-tiered approaches to cancer prevention I recommend looking around Vincent Giuliano’s Anti-Aging Firewalls site. Like many life-extension self-experimenters he’s a bit supplement happy for my taste, but he’s pointed me to a lot of active research avenues and has put together some useful summaries.I can’t claim expertise in chemopreventative phytonutrient combinations, and I suspect few experts exist. While there are studies pointing to synergistic effects of targeting say, phase II enzyme induction with multiple phytochemicals, that’s just one chemopreventative mechanism. Most of the work exists as in vitro studies on cancer cell cultures, with a few comparing different phytochemicals’ effectiveness (eg. high throughput studies for drug candidate discovery), and to my knowledge none comparing different phytochemical combination regimens for in vitro cancer progression, much less on in vivo outcomes.The various anti-cancer mechanisms assume varying importance in different stages of cancer progression. The Nrf-2 inducing hormetins are perhaps most important in preventing initial mutations, while they may have a negative impact on advanced cancer (by protecting cancer cells). Angiogenesis inhibitors, on the other hand, won’t have much effect on microscopic cancer cells. Given we don’t know what stage our occult cancers are at, it seems reasonable to adopt a multi-tiered approach. Vince Giuliano, who has studied this for a decade, likens his approach to the redundant firewalls in computer security, and I’ve learned a lot from him.Kinetic studies of EGCG from tea and sulforaphane from broccoli show plasma peaks 4-8 hours after ingestion, but cytoprotective enzymes remain elevated for days. Its probably unwise to try megadoses of a lot of these compounds, as their benefits sometimes arise from the cell’s detoxification response to clear them out. Variety, and regular, small (food rather than supplement size) doses are sensible. An ideal anti-cancer diet might be triathlete and cancer survivor Ruth Heidrich’s diet, but even I’m not sure I’m ready for salad every meal.This is not a guarantee. A dear friend of mine who was a Vegan vegetarian died of lung cancer this past February. Her circle of friends were shocked at her diagnosis and then her death. I think that eating a variety of fruits & veggies helps supply you with agents that help to eradicate the cancer cells’ blood supply which is crucial to their survival. However, many people do not understand the concept that cancer is a MULTIFACTORIAL disease. In other words, there are many other factors that can contribute to cancer causation such as genetics, lifestyle factors, environmental contamination, stress, vitamin deficiencies (particularly Vitamin D3 which also has an impact on cardiovascular disease) and so forth. Be well!!!Wow…the eyes of aborted fetuses. Who knew.Awful, isn’t it?This is great stuff as is usual from you Dr. Greger!It does “beg the question”, What foods PROMOTE angioenesis??? Those would be ones to avoid most likely though not always. Beets for example promote nitric formation which in turn may promote angiogenesis. And really any foods high in arginine may well do the same and that would include nuts/seeds/rice… Would really love some more/deeper clarification on this one!Go up to the sourses above and look into Dr. Li’s work. He has a website that lists the foods. Most are the “best of” foods that appear in Dr Greger’s videos.There is much talk that sugars, including fruit sugars, feed cancers. Where does that fit into a cancer-killing vegan diet?Thinkabouddit: I’m not familiar with studies showing that whole fruits, with their sugars, feed cancers. I am familiar with studies on this site showing that whole fruits fight cancers – especially berries. And I *think* there is even a video showing dates fighting colon or rectal cancer. (But I may be making that up.)I can imagine that table sugar would be a problem, but I have a hard time imagining that a whole fruit, especially organic, would be a promote cancer. Maybe if you took the sugars out of the fruit – but that is not how we enlightened people eat fruit.I wonder if Dr. Greger’s recent blog post could shed some light on things. Here’s my thought: What if those studies trying to say that sugar in fruits feed cancer are really confusing other aspects of the fruit – such as pesticides? Here’s what I’m getting at from Dr. Greger’s blog post:“A new study calculated that if half the U.S. population ate just one more serving of conventional fruits and vegetables, 20,000 cases of cancer could be prevented. At the same time the added pesticide consumption could cause up to 10 extra cancer cases. So by eating conventional produce we may get a tiny bump in cancer risk, but that’s more than compensated by the dramatic drop in risk that accompanies whole food plant consumption.”From:http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/25/apple-peels-turn-on-anticancer-genes/Just a thought. I’m just guessing that the studies which say that fruit feeds cancer are probably either a) getting mixed up in what they are measuring or b) are focusing on those 10 extra cancer cases listed above and missing the bigger picture of the 20,000 avoided. Again, just a guess.It’s just what “they” say. I don’t believe that organic fruit could be anything but healthy.Sugars feed all cells, including cancer cells. So if you eradicated all sugars from your diet, yes you could “starve” cancer cells along with every other cell in your body. However it is true that due to the rate at which cancer cells divide compared to most other cells, they are more sensitive in general to interventions that target growth. This is how traditional chemotherapy works and why other rapidly dividing sites such as hair follicles (hair loss), stomach lining (nausea), and bone marrow (immune system impairment) are inadvertently targeted along with the tumor. Traditional chemotherapy kills cancer cells, sure, but it also kills every other cell in the body, albeit at a slower rate. Administering it is a balance between trying to kill the tumor before you kill the rest of the patient.So I guess my point is that context and balance are key. Things that kill cancer cells can kill normal cells, though indeed many plants are capable of targeted cancer cell killing, and this is an exciting area of research. And on the other hand things that cause cancer cell growth can be necessary for the growth of normal cells as well, though there are many things that cancer cells require (like angiogenesis factors for one) that normal cells don’t. However sugar is not one of those things. It is needed by both cancerous and normal cells.Eradicating sugar from your diet wouldn’t starve the cancer as your body always has glucose in the blood as it’s our cells energy source. If we don’t eat sugar then our body converts fats into sugar via lipolysis…. and puts it into blood stream for cellular energyWow, recently diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, I found this video not only “eye opening” and “earth shattering”. As I’ve told so many folks over the years. “you don’t have to believe; but you’ve definitely got to think about it”. In any case, “THANK YOu” so very, very much and “vegan” here I come. Don and I CAN! :-))nSouthlander: Sorry to hear about your diagnosis.Good for you for your positive attitude. While diet is not a magic pill and there are no guarantees, there are many, many stories of cancer patients who are able to reverse their cancers on a whole, plant food based diet. But probably not just any diet. Darryl listed some great ideas to start to figure out which foods to focus on. See Darryl’s post above. It’s great.Also, you may want to check out a very inspiring story that Dr. Greger posted on his Facebook page about a 90 year old man who appear to have beaten prostate cancer: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=679724962044016&set=a.505323302817517.132300.215513991798451&type=1You may also want to check out the many more videos on this site that deal with cancer. You will learn that there are many ways in which a whole plant food (supplemented with B12!) diet fights cancer. I think a good way to start is with the blog posts that have a subject matter of cancer. Then you can watch the videos that Dr. Greger links to in his blog posts.If you are not familiar with plant-based eating, there are some great recipe books out there. The food is fantastic. Most people find themselves surprised at how their food horizons expand, when they expected nothing but contraction. You just have to find the recipes that you like.Good luck to you!Can”t understand why people would rather hack burn or bomb symptoms with poisons than feed the body good phytonutrients to cure it. Should be taught in schools at an early age ideally ? Probiotics too ?Dr Li of the Angiogenesis Foundation gave a TED talk on this in 2010. Part of the talk discussed results of experiments which showed the inhibiting effects of diet (plant substances) on cancer cell growth. One reason I drink green tea and eat berries…http://www.angio.org/understanding/diet.php From what I am coming to understand, much of the positive and negative effects of substances in foods is due to impact on cell signaling, not the quenching or generation of free radicals. This would include influencing gene expression.I’ve come to similar conclusions. A few papers that clarified my thoughts on exogenous antioxidants: Significance of dietary antioxidants for healthExogenous antioxidants—double-edged swords in cellular redox state: health beneficial effects at physiologic doses versus deleterious effects at high doses.Plant-derived compounds as antioxidants for health—are they all really antioxidantsResearch strategies in the study of the pro-oxidant nature of polyphenol nutraceuticalsAntioxidants prevent health-promoting effects of physical exercise in humansA systems biology perspective on Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responseThe ORAC and similar in vitro antioxidant assays seem to provide a rough measure of biologically active polyphenol content, but the benefits of polyphenols may be through pro-oxidant interactions with cell regulatory molecules, rather than mopping up reactive nitrogen and oxygen species themselves.Take note of the statement at the very end of the video (which no one seems to have picked up on), that low fat plays an anti-cancer role.Just wanted to share a patient that came to the office yesterday.Young female started a Vegan diet after visiting our office about 2 months ago. A couple weeks later was having such severe pain while breathing in she went to the ER for evaluation.CT scan showed 3 cm tumor growing in right lung.Cardiothoracic surgeon and second opinion both agreed needed at least a biopsy because it looked like Cancer. Because of the severe pain, regardless of whether or not it was benign or malignant, patient opted to have it removed rather than biopsied and then removed.5 days ago the patient went in for surgery, was prepped and sent for repeat CT to zero in on where tumor was. The radiologist and first surgeon couldn’t find the tumor anymore. They called the original Cardiothoracic surgeon to take a look and he could barely see where it was. They were dumbfounded!! The tumor was so small they didn’t need to operate. They sent her home!Patient called me and asked my opinion about what happened to the tumor. I stated there is no way to actually prove (that I know of) that changing her diet was the actual cause of the shrinkage of the tumor but as the days Video shows the evidence is quite compelling that changing her diet was probably what caused the tumors demise.Patient has no more pain and is able to exercise and live life normally thanks to what looks like a simple change in lifestyle. No other conventional treatment has ever been so successful!In fact the patient shared that all the nurses were asking her what she did because they have never seen something like this before. And she told them the only thing she did was change her diet–she couldn’t even exercise because the pain was so severe. She said they were all amazed.Interestingly she said the doctors didn’t seen to be so impressed with her tumor disappearance which I personally find disappointing.We are going to write this case study up with the CT images and hopefully get it published.Anyway, thanks for reading and thanks to Dr. Greger for disseminating the peer reviewed research on the benefits of lifestyle changes. You really are a lifesaver!Very interesting story! Thanks for sharing.Yes, I’m glad you enjoyed it. I thought it was great! I’ve had a couple of other like this as well but not a dramatic nor in such a short time.Wow. She came to you 2 months ago and you were able to convince her to become a vegan? You’re good. What did you say to convince her?One key is I always try to meet the patient where they are. If they aren’t ready to change I won’t even go there. But she was already willing and so the change was easy, she just needed the support and that is what we are experts at where I work.During an office visit the patients get 90 minutes with a health coach and me. The health coach brings them in for the first 30 minutes, then all of us together for the next 30 min. where I teach the pertinent points in the benefits of lifestyle change (much of what you see on this website. Here’s a lecture that I did a while ago http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh6XL3JoIto –not as good as Dr. Greger’s but you will get the idea of what I teach by watching.), then the last 30 is reinforcement time to review what we went over and to provide a food plan. And then phone or email follow-up about every week. Makes it much easier to keep the patients on track.You must be so satisfied. The move was worth it right?That video is great!Thank you so much. I’m glad you enjoyed the info.Dr Dynamic, Great video!You are too kind. Thanks for watching!I have this patient I am just trying to get to decrease from 10 servings of fish per week! “But they live longer in Japan.” He is cutting back on all animal but it is like pulling teeth!I always tell my patients about how fish are the biotoxic accumulators of our environment because every single drug that People take and every single environmental toxin ends up in our oceans and hence, our fish. And then there is PHiP in all cooked meats that is very pro-inflammatory and all animal protein regardless of source turns on the genes that promote cancer, etc.But as the Buddhist proverb states, “When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.”And Confucius, “It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.”Remember life is wonderful in that we have free-will so as long as you provide the information you should feel great and not worry about the other person changing. You have planted a seed and some take longer to sprout than others.Agreed.HemoDynamic: Awesome story!! Thanks so much for taking the time to share that. I love stories like that.What a fantastic anecdote! Reading this story made be feel good all over. What an amazing outcome for this patient. The power of healthy plant-based eating does not cease to amaze me. Keep sharing the positive anecdotes please!Just got to this but wow……. you keep your heart and pelvic arteries open with plants and you keep your tumor arteries closed with plants. How wonderful the body isFrom the 1st source cited (“Tumor angiogenesis as a target for dietary cancer prevention”), the lead author, Dr. Li, did a great Ted talk on this subject. It can be watched here: http://www.ted.com/talks/william_li.htmlI was wondering if there are any cookbooks you can recommend. Thanks!Karen: I appear to be addicted to vegan cookbooks. I have over 70 of them now. (Seriously addicted.) While I am by no means an expert and have had time to try only a small number of the recipes in all those books, here’s my favorite all-around cooking books so far:> Vegan on the Cheap > Happy Everyday Herbivore > Let Them Eat VeganIt’s hard to restrict to just three, but those would be my top three as of this moment. They are mostly whole-plant food based, but very do-able and most of the recipes I tried from these books come out to my liking. And best of all, I believe that the majority of the recipes in these books would fit with Dr. Greger’s nutrition recommendations. (Not that I am speaking for Dr. Greger.)I think this is a great question and hope that other people will chime in with their favorite books as well.What is your opinion on the Ketogenic diet for the treatment of breast cancer?So what do you have to say about someone who is a total vegan and excersises daily in otherwise excellent health and ends up with breast cancer?p sully: I’m sorry to hear that you or someone you know has cancer.Here is how I explain this situation to people that I work with:People who smoke can live long lives without any lung cancer. And yet, people who smoke have dramatically more risk of developing lung cancer. Conversely, those who do not smoke have dramatically less *chances* of getting lung cancer. But even people who don’t smoke can and do get lung cancer.Diet is just like that. It is not a magic guarantee of anything. But ohhhh boy can a NutritionFacts diet *dramatically* decrease the risk of developing a range of major diseases, including cancer. Not a guaranteed, but wonderful insurance.That’s a perspective for you. I think I would also add that diet is just one factor in affecting diseases. It is a biggie. But not the only factor.I hope this reply helps and that whoever we are talking about experiences remission.You say that diet etc. can prevent one third of cancers. I have been reading and hearing numbers much higher than that. I am more comfortable with what you say here. Would you tell where the number of one third comes from.Can a plant diet also inhibit the formation of new blood vessels for non cancer cells or does it just affect cancer growth?Maybe cancer cells serve a useful function we do not know?I heard that veggie Diet cure cancer and there are Dr. that do this sore of thing to help people .One more for the good guys.The review you cited about rosemary being anti-angiogenic looks fascinating (Anti-angiogenic properties of carnosol and carnosic acid, two major dietary compounds from rosemary.) Any indication of how much should be consumed to receive the benefit?Excellent and short! Love this website!What about benign tumors? Is anti-angiogenesis equally important for non cancerous tumors to grow? Can benign tumors perform apoptosis? A beloved family member is facing surgery for removal of a tumor (likely benign) pressing into the spinal column. This involves sawing off the back half of a vertebra to access it. Any ideas are welcome.Oooookay, the end remark promoted a vegan diet. I find that one claim might make your entire video biased. For everyone’s information, hunter-gatherer populations are the healthiest in the world, with incidences of cancer being rare. THOUSANDS of epidemiological studies on hunter-gatherers, their diet, correlation between vegetable intake and cancer, compounds in Brassica vegetables all point in one direction: vegetables (especially brassica vegetables like Broccoli) and fruit help prevent cancer. Because cancer is rare in hunter-gatherer populations who eat a traditional human diet of MEAT (wild meat that is), fruits, vegetables and nuts, you do not need to go vegan to prevent cancer. However, many studies have shown how unhealthy and cancer-promoting western, grain-fed, factory raised meat can be. The nutritional composition of our meat versus wild game, or traditionally raised meats, has dramatic differences, with the wild meats actually being good for you and the western raised meats not so good. No one needs to go vegan in order to prevent cancer. Just stop eating processed foods, cook your own food, try to eat grass-fed beef or pastured chickens, seafood, and eat fruits and vegetables 3 times a day each. Eat your broccoli raw for maximum absorbtion of glucosinolates (precursers to anti-cancer comounds).Hello, I’m Martin from Argentina. When i look all these videos I can’t stop surprising milself. Its amazing the stuf your explaining with that all evidence. Congratulations. And thank you for sharing it. I have one questios if you let me. What happens with a person diagnosticated with cancer start with the plant based diet, should he stopped the tradicional medicine that Dorctos supplied him? Would that medicine interfere whith the benefits of the plant based diet? Ill be gratefull wiht your answer, and sorry for my English. Thank you MartinMartin: I’m not a doctor. I just wanted to make sure someone responds to you.I’m so glad you are getting benefit from these videos. I’m a big believer in the importance and practical application of this information.As for your question about treating cancer, I’ll give you my lay-person’s 2 cents: I don’t think anyone can answer that question for you. You would need to sit down with someone who understands your particular situation (what type of cancer, how fast it’s growing, your risk factors, etc) AND who understands nutrition AND who understands the pros and cons of traditional medicine options for your situation. That person would ideally be able to help you answer your question and/or refer you to sources that will help you make that decision. And ideally, that person would be your doctor.In America, it is very hard to find a doctor who could do this, but it is possible, especially if someone is willing to do a lot of their own research. I don’t know how things are in Argentina. I’m thinking good thoughts for you (or whoever you are asking about) that you can find someone who understands both traditional medicine and the powerful cancer fighting effects of proper nutrition. There are lots of videos on this site related to cancer too. I those can also help. *Good luck.*My husband first found out he was diabetic, then that he had prostate cancer. We found the video ‘forks over knives’ at our local library – Ontario, Canada; and he was off to the races. He had been a huge meat eater and lover of all animal carcasses, once diagnosed completely changed to a vegan diet – no oils, no fish, no chicken, no red meat, no dairy which included eggs, no fat in products over 2 grams and became completely diabetic and cancer free within months – that was 3 years ago and still free….it works!Dee: That’s such a *powerful* story. Thanks for sharing it!!!Has there ever been a link between nutrition and non-cancerous lipoma? I have been eating a vegan diet for 2 years now and still manage to get lipomas once in a while.","['aging', 'angiogenesis', 'antiangiogenesis', 'apigen', 'beans', 'berries', 'breast cancer', 'breast health', 'broccoli', 'cancer', 'cancer survival', 'celery', 'citrus', 'exercise', 'fisitin', 'flavonoids', 'fruit', 'luteolin', 'metastases', 'peppers', 'phytonutrients', 'plant-based diets', 'polyphenols', 'rice', 'spices', 'strawberries', 'tea', 'vegans', 'vegetarians', 'VEGF', 'weight loss', ""women's health""]","Cancer cells are commonly present in the body, but cannot grow into tumors without hooking up a blood supply.

These absolute excess lifetime cancer risks (to age 100 years) are very small compared with the lifetime risk of developing cancer in the general population, which is about one in three”Ie, for those with the maximum increased risk (children younger than 18) 4 abdominal CTs would increase risk from 0.33 to 0.34 .As a physician I am aware of the harm modern medicine can cause to patients and also I am encouraged that somebody is speaking out. I want to learn more from you.Defensive medicine (thanks to lawyers and legislation) will only increase this problem in the future. Every doctor knows about ordering unnecessary CT and MR scans – just to avoid problems in the future (for the doctor). For every test the indication has to be right. Everything has a price. CT and MR is only to confirm your clinical suspicion. I really hate the thought that we do harm to our patients. There has to be a change, from trying to fix unfixable problems, to helping people avoid the problems in the first place. McDougall has this great picture of a man with hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol going to his doctor. The next picture: The same man with hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol and now he is carrying a bag full of prescription drugs! Has he become more healthy? No!Is it likely that even darker forces are applying pressure to use these machines just to draw in some cash flow?I understand the question; diseasecare is complicated. The doctor, the patient, false expectations, the drugs, the procedures, the politics, the money, the screening, the reductive science, the defensive medicine etc. I would advice every patient to ask their doctor what he/she expects to get out of a procedure, blodtest, CT or MR scan, PET etc.I know this, and my daughter has had one CT scan..and many xrays..and me as well…WHAT CAN WE DO TO UNDO THE DAMAGE!!???? PLEASE GIVE US SOME ADVICE???it was mentioned that we have to eat more veggies and fruit. go back to plant based diet or in the other word become a vegan. it will enhance our self repair system, fix the damage and helps body to remove the unwanted cells (cancer cells).There are a few videos dealing with radiation exposure that Dr G has done. Particularly, lemon balm tea and ginger had a big positive effect. Also, anything that is going to help repair DNA, like veggies and especially cruciferous.Also, Chlorella might be very useful. Spirulina also, but as Dr G mentions, it suffers from some contamination issues. It is important to get clean, radiaiton and toxin free chlorella. CGF is associated with DNA repair.Also, research medicinal mushrooms.Citrus, To reverse the damage get your health and body well nourished if you aren’t already.1. Opt for MRI’s,Sonograms and Thermography. If you must have X-rays ask for low radiation X-rays or CT Scans.2. There are ways to detox your body and protect it from radiation. I was concerned about getting X-rays due to a back injury so I went on to research and found out that protecting your DNA before and after any of those procedures is possible by juicing certain vegetables and fruits high in antioxidants (ginger, berries, turmeric etc..) and in this case radish. I have this juice here: http://www.healyounaturally.com/dna-protect-liver-cleanse-juice/ (Please Dr. G and team let me know and I will remove this link if you feel it isn’t appropriate).3. By supplementing with superfoods such spirulina, radiation free-chlorella and other top supplements. I have hand picked those supplements and much more in my “natural healing shop” under Supplements on the site.Hope this helps!Hi Astrid. I would just be cautious of recommending spirulina and chlorella. Companies can not seem to get pure cultures of it so contaminated blue-green algae may be the reason why in the store, so-called pure spirulina, has toxins. For chlorella, this case study on psychosis is enough to issue caution. Chlorella appears to be helpful for patients with Hepatitis C and perhaps others, it also does not appear to produce muscle, nerve, or liver toxicity that’s been linked to spirulina, but this case on psychosis is enough to sound the alarm per Dr. Greger. I suggest supplementing with whole plant-foods and not juicing as it removed more than just fiber.What can be done if you already had a CT scan? Can the dammage be tracked? Can eating lots of antioxidants through plant foods really help or is the level of radiation too high? This video really upset me as I have had multiple CT scans and now it seems like I will most probably end up getting cancer, be it in 20 or 30 years… Is there anything that can be done?Have you seen the videos: “Slowing the Growth of Cancer” and “Cancer Prevention & Treatment May Be the Same Thing”?Even thousands of years ago, before industrial waste and toxic food products, we still encountered naturally occurring radiation and carcinogens that our bodies had to guard against. Our DNA repair enzymes are working all the time and our immune system is working to extinguish precancerous and cancerous cells all the time. It’s not a matter of “having cancer” or “not having cancer”; we all have cancer! It’s really just a matter of chronic treatment and suppression. You can wait until you have a full blown tumor and throw some super potent chemo at it, or you can give any little fledgling cancers you might have started already some low-dose chemo in the form of tea, greens, onions, and mushrooms on a daily basis.I hope these two videos give you a new perspective and some peace on the subject.I’m trying to find the videos you’ve mentioned, but the site’s search isn’t picking it up. Do you have direct links? Thanks.Hi Lloyd,That’s weird how the search button doesn’t pick it up. I’m always leery of putting links in comments lest they get thrown out, but if you go to the ‘prostate cancer’ tab in the alphabetical topics list on the left hand side of the page, the “Treatment & Prevention” video is on the 3rd page of the search results, and the “Slowing the Growth” video is on the 5th page. They’re great videos, a couple of my all time favorites! Enjoy.The search isn’t perfect, and on the note of technical difficulties, my browser is having a hard time signing in with FB so here I am, as some “Disq” user.Thanks b00mer.

Even if half of them are about things that cause it, that would still give you over a hundred videos about treating it!I have had two ct head scans and one brain angiogram all in space of 2 weeks as I had a bad Lumber puncture which gave a possible false read of billirubin 0.0073 just 3 over the cut off period and had to have all these tests which concluded perfectly normal but I’m worried about all the radiation exposure anyone have any advise please? Jasmin boytHi Jasmine. It is so hard to say. The best advice I feel was laid out in Dr. Greger’s video. Limit exposure when possible and eat a clean diet and lifestyle in hopes to prevent disease. If your doctor is requiring CT scans I am sure there is a qualified reason. It is important to realize the risk of “not” receiving the proper medical treatments, also. Perhaps there is a balance with preventive medicine and the ding the best we can, and diagnostic testing that although harmful, may be necessary to live. These are only my thoughts and I cannot give medical advice.Warm thoughts, JosephCitrus and Joelle, I know where you are coming from. My son also had a CT scan and plenty of chest X-rays. It’s all very well to say that the best thing to do is to avoid them by staying healthy. In some cases that IS JUST NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER. In my son’s case it was a matter of life and death – he was already very sick. No amount of eating plants would have prevented him contracting pneumonia, being misdiagnosed by a paediatrician and then developing complications!I would also like to know how you can mitigate the risk. It has already happened. He had a CT scan. Do I now wait with baited breath for him to develop cancer? Do I watch him like a hawk for unusual symptoms? Do I not allow him to eat nasties like sweets and crisps like other little 6 year olds do on occasion? Etcetera, etcetera. FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE? (All of which I do. And as he says to me, he wishes he were another boy who is allowed to eat what other little boys eat (and probably whose mother doesn’t go hysterical at the first sign of a illness)). I’ll admit that I am paranoid but until I discover something other than lifestyle to minimise his risks (healthy plant-based diet, fresh air, sunshine, plenty of sleep, going to a pediatrician who doesn’t hand out antibiotics like sweets), this is what I have to do to minimise his risk. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT parents like Citrus and me who are scared witless can do? Anyone?Hi Angela, I mentioned to Joelle above the two videos “Slowing the Growth of Cancer” and “Cancer Prevention & Treatment May Be the Same Thing”.Our bodies are truly designed to fight cancer, provided we give them the materials they need to do the job (plants!). In short, I know of nothing specific to undo the damage of radiation that one can do after the fact, but I would watch all the videos Dr. Greger has on mushrooms, tea, greens, cruciferous, alliums, berries, etc, and know that every time you feed them to your son, you’re giving him little doses of preventative chemo. You should know you’re doing your best by him and feel good about it, especially since it sounds like the CT scan in your case was truly warranted.These plants are so powerful, especially when you look at the doses involved; half a mushroom a day, three spinach leaves a day, etc, make such an incredible difference in cancer prevention. Good health to you and yours, cheers.Yes, Angela…You and I have the same issues here…hope to hear from the doctor soon on this! :)It would be nice if Dr Greger could provide some information about how to interpret statistics for those not familiar with that topic. Many people misinterpret an increased risk of 30% for having a 30% chance to develop some disease while it means that a base risk of 1% increases to 1.3%. Which is not that much more.I already had one CT – Scan and the presented facts are really disturbing. But let let me just add something which might sooth one or another.You should always see an increased risk in relation to the unavoidable basic risk to develop cancer during live time. This basic risk is usually quite low depending on the type of cancer. And to triple a risk doesn’t mean that you are likely to develop cancer.Let’s say if “1.49% of men and women born today will be diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas at some time during their livetime”, than tripling this risk is still relatively low. (http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html)Anyway, all this is only statistics and average values. The probability of individuals scatters a great deal and if your diet is healthy and risk reducing you have a good chance that you belong to the fraction of people with fairly reduced cancer risk.Everything is relative. Nothing is absolute.Excellent information! Perhaps a permanent sticky note or tag line on the subject below each video would be helpful; I’m sure Dr. Greger wouldn’t want to explain it anew in each video, but you’re right, most people aren’t statisticians.I wonder how the radiation of mammograms compares to CT scans? Even if mammograms have much less radiation, I think the risks should be determined and shared with every woman in helping them make the decision on what to do.Personally, the document linked to in the following paragraph convinced me (along with my doctor) that mammograms are not a good idea for most women – including me.“McDougall Breaking News – The Cochrane Committee now recommends against mammograms for women of all ages. Screening for Breast Cancer with Mammography – Published by the Nordic Cochrane Center 2012. What are the benefits and harms? How many will benefit and how many will be harmed? What is the scientific evidence?”– Source : http://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2012other/news/jun/mammogram.htmMammogram doses are much smaller than CT doses – screening mammography has doses near 3 mGy total (for 2 views of each breast), wheras each adult abdominal CTs averages 14 mGy and adult head CTs averages 60 mGy.The Cochrane review of screening mammography was concerned less with medical radiation than with the high rates of false positives, unnecessary treatment of ultimately harmless tumors, and (in the 2012 update) negligible savings in lives from early diagnosis.Darryl: Thanks for the reply. (Sorry it took me so long to get back to this.)I have read the Cochrane study in detail, but was curious about the radiation doses. I appreciate you taking the time to answer that question. Very interesting.I stopped getting mammograms many years ago. I have opted for thermography imaging instead. It’s not only ZERO radiation, it’s also completely painless and they usually also include your torso (front and back), neck and head. These are normally not covered by insurance, but the cost of around $150-200 every couple years is really worth saving the risk of cancer!Dr. Gregar, as a recent cancer survivor – 1st stage lung with top rt. lobectomy and no chemo/radiation, how should I think about balancing the risk of bi-annual follow-up CT scans vs return of cancer? Thanks.Stay tuned for a video on what you can do to mediate your risk. Make sure you’re subscribed so you don’t miss it: http://bit.ly/nutritionfactsupdatesDr. Greger, please could you help me with this question? is really important to me. I would like to know which are the maximum levels of kV kilov-oltage and mAs that ct machines have? and if a high kV/mAs is used during a ct exam, does the patient have symptoms? radiation exposure depends on them and Im really worriedIn January 2007 I had 13 CT scans after an accident, primarily done to my head. What can I do now to protect or heal myself?My young son who is due to turn 7 later this month (December 2013) is due to have an X-ray of his skull next week here in England as he suffers from a very rare genetic disorder (Occipital Horn Syndrome) and the clinical genetic paediatricians want to look at his occipital prominences in more detail (the occipital bone is a saucer-shaped membrane bone situated at the back and lower part of the cranium). Sorry to sound naïve but does Dr. Greger (or anyone else here) know if the full mouth (panoramic) X-rays referred to here (in the accompanying video) would be the same procedure and method (and therefore present the same degree of invasiveness) as for a skull x-ray? Whilst we are or course keen to learn more about our son’s condition, understandably we have no wish to put him at risk from any other consequences from the radiation risk posed if it’s not entirely necessary. Any comments would be most gratefully received. Many thanks, SteveNo sound!It’s much worse than that. ER doctors and staff routinely pressure patients to get unnecessary scans. Once I had extreme pain from kidney stones and the ER staff wanted to get a scan, even though I brought my stone diagnosis with me as well as a CD containing the data from my last CT scan that was only a few weeks old. Doctors described the risk of a CT scan as “minimal” and nurses said the scan was “perfectly safe” and that there was “literally no risk” from a scan. I tried to say no and the nurse insisted. Then she fetched a doctor to convince me. I said “no” with total conviction and the doctor said I was “refusing treatment”(!) and tried to frighten me. They made it very difficult to not get a scan and this is typical.These doctors and nurses aren’t thinking at all about the damage they are causing with the radiation exposure. Their priority is covering their ass and minimizing their liability. And that means unnecessary tests and unnecessary scans. In a perfect world, doctors would be making the call about whether or not these scans are necessary. Unfortunately, for the time being, we as patients are going to have to act as our own advocates.thank you doctor greger. I’m actually almost in tears at how grateful I am that you will fight against the establishment for us to bring us this kind of information. Now I know to keep my own mother away from those death machines. Time to start reenforcing a better diet plan and not a better healthcare plan.I’m getting a CT scan tomorrow to find out what is causing my severe Hydronephrosis. I don’t want to be giving myself cancer in the process. What can I do in the next 22 hours to minimize my risk? Load up on all the antioxidants I can? Already vegan (not exactly the healthiest, should eat more veggies, I’ll obviously start with that). Trying not to freak out because I know that stress depletes antioxidants as well. Gotta go make some hibiscus tea. Tips would be great.Gina: I’m not sure what you can do in a short period of time, but I think you can definitely work on long-term changes that could be of great help.Dr. Greger has several videos on this site that talk about the importance of cancer growth rates. Some of the information is very powerful. I may not have all the details right off the top of my head, but here is the gist of the idea: We are exposed to carcinogens all the time. Suppose you get that first cancer cell from a CT scan. No one ever died from a single cancer cell. It takes about a billion (?) cells before your body will start to register that you have a problem. So, depending on how fast the cancer cells multiply, you could actually get cancer in as little as 2 years or as many as 85 years (or more?) from now. Depending on how old you are now, getting cancer in 85 years might not be relevant…Clearly, how fast cancer grows is key to being “cancer-free”. While there are no guarantees, studies on this site seem to show that you have some control over how fast cancer cells grow. This is the great news. Because we are all exposed to carcinogens – not just people who get CTs.I hope you will take some time to find the cancer videos on this site. (I don’t have a handy list myself or I would have shared it with you.) You should be able to use those videos to figure out how to tweak your diet to make it a good long-term diet that minimizes your risk of getting cancer.I hope your CT scan went really well and you are able to figure out a solution to your problem. Good luck!I have to undergo a nuclear stress test on my heart this coming week. Either that, or go back in a cath lab for another angiogram — both involve high exposure to radiation – but my cardiac symptoms are pretty severe.I already became a vegan when diagnosed. But, can anyone suggest REPUTABLE articles on foods, herbs, etc that I should really emphasize over the coming weeks to reduce DNA damage and cancer risk?Hi hello, Someone that exposed high levels of radiation by repeated ct scans, can prevent a radio-induced cancer by eating health or nothing to do ?","['angiogram', 'brain health', 'brain tumors', 'breast cancer', 'breast health', 'cancer', 'CAT scan', 'children', 'CT scan', 'heart disease', 'heart health', 'Hiroshima', 'iatrogenic', 'infants', 'Japan', 'leukemia', 'mortality', 'Nagasaki', 'radiation', 'smoking', 'stress test', ""women's health"", 'X-rays']",Pediatric CAT scans are estimated to cause hundreds of cancer deaths every year.,"As I explain in my full-length live presentation on preventing, arresting, and reversing the 15 top killers (Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death), adverse drug reactions from prescription drugs are estimated to cause more than 100,000 deaths in the United States every year, making doctors the sixth leading cause of death. That's not counting other ""iatrogenic"" (physician-caused) harm, such as medication errors or infections acquired in hospitals. My profession needs to do a better job of offering fully informed consent, clearly and comprehensively explaining the risks and benefits of each alternate course of action.The risk associated with the thallium heart scans was shocking to me. By eating healthy, we may not only eliminate the death and disability associated with heart disease and its treatment (such as open heart surgery), but the risks associated with heart disease diagnosis as well.

Danger, Will Robinson!”;)You have done it again. You start a series and I end up with more questions. Then by the end you have answered them all! I will keep eating my fruits and vegetables and feed my friendly gut friends.Dr G is also master of suspense….Wait a minute. Don’t we wash and cook the veggies to get rid of the bad bacteria?Also, what about kimchee and cancer? The more I learn the more confused I am.I live in South America and have to soak my fruits and veggies in water with grapefruit seed extract to clean them. Does this kill the beneficial bacteria, like probiotics, also? Is there a better way to clean my veggies (remember that even the water here isn’t safe to drink) that would maintain the beneficial bacteria? Thank you for the great information.I live west of you on an island where we collect roof water into cisterns and use that for everything. And we have high rates of asthma and water-borne disease. Two things I would suggest is use aeration in the water. I’m told it reduces the anaerobes (bad bugs are often that type). Second, pathogens are often gram-negatives (in this case gram refers to a type of dye). I’m no microbiologist but my reading indicates that gram negatives die when dried out. The good bugs are gram positive and can withstand a good drying. I’m sure others here will know how true or effective this is likely to be.We keep a supply of boiled drinking water at all times. Say, what does grapefruit seed extract do ? disinfect?Having a breakfast smoothie of fruit, vegetables, bran and fresh kefir that I make has relieved me of all irritable bowel symptoms I had for the past 10 years. though, I can still get a upper respiratory tract infection, it seems less frequent.I was so freaked out by the veg-borne E. coli infections , for a while I washed all the raw stuff obsessively. Even using dilute bleach to disinfect… AND yet I was so sick with IBS type syptoms for years. Finally I started growing most of what we eat. Now everything gets a quick rinse, then onto the plate. Not unusual to pick off a green cabbage patch caterpillar hanging onto some kale, they don’t seem to mind. Guess what, almost all my colon problems are history. Over the past 2 years things continuously improved. I’m told I can be heard singing Rocky (“gonna fly now…”) almost exactly the same time every morning.I make my own compost using our own stuff on our little 5 acre plot. Pet chickens, a 3 year old heifer, a way too fat ewe and goat, greens and browns… all contribute to our garden soil. So we can imagine the variety of bugs we eat and where they’ve been! But by the end of the composting process the whole ecosystem has speed-volved into real soil for real plants. Contrast with Industrial food growers who shortcut the process and expose your lovely veg to toxic poopie before its been worked over by the natural succession of microflora during proper composting.My point being, I’m sure this vid is spot on partly because the science supports it but also my personal experience has been so positive. I understand the path to the real dirt on farming. I can feel it in my bowels. I just want to go the distance!Thanks once again Dr. G!Absolutely wonderful life!Thank you once again Dr. Greger! You keep giving me reasons to continue eating a plant-centered diet! I also feel great too!Does this work because my colds are soo bad.London garage rentalsDr. Gregor, have you determined from the studies which was the most accurate brand of probiotics to take? What’s your recommendation?In the store there are probiotics that are in bottles on the shelf or there are one that are in the refrigerator. Are there refrigerated ones better? They certainly are more expensive but if they are better for us then they are worth the price.I do have one question, I noticed you don’t have any info on kefir or did I just fail to notice it. Just curious what your opinion on kefir is, is it as healthy as we make it out to be?Thank youbelieveinbee: I am aware of two types of kefir – one that is grown in a water base and one that is grown in a dairy/milk base. And Dr. Greger has much to say about the problems with dairy!: http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/I think that people tout kefir as being healthy because it has probiotics in it. Dr. Greger also has a lot to say about probiotics. You can get what you need, especially with pre-biotics without resorting to dairy. So, while I don’t speak for Dr. Greger, I think the bottom line is that Dr. Greger would not recommend dairy kefir, because food is a package deal and the benefits do not outweight the harms. http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=probioticsHope that helps.A little late but kefir can be used in plant milks with the addition of dates for the sugar source!

Your tax dollars and euros are subsidising foods that will kill you (and your government will save money on pension) or make you sick in younger age (and you will pay through tax or insurance for treatment) instead of foods that will save you and the planet. Michael Greger is so trustworthy – he is not in this for the money – proceeds for charity on books and DVD`s – and definitely not to get popular in the medical community. The bulk of evidence points only in one direction: A whole food plant based diet.The logic and visuals in this video are simply awesome. I LOVE it. Great job!I wish people would finally wake up. Dr. Greger, when will you be on Dr. Oz’s show? I am really interested to watch as Dr. Oz unfortunately wavers (I find) on his views depending on who is on.I have asked myself this very question, i.e., “can people afford to eat healthy?” I know beans are cheap, but what about them fruits and vegetables? Now I know. I’ve looked at the long game scenario also—what if you did pay a bit more for the good stuff?, wouldn’t you save money by not having as much health care cost. What about all those extra years you may live? What about just feeling healthier and happier?Exactly!Actually – if you look at it in another way, the standard western diet is cheaper. From the standard western diet you can get fat, cancer, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, impotence, heart attack and osteoporosis – If you eat a low fat whole food plant based diet you probably get nothing. 1 diet and 8 diseases…..thats cheap !! :-)I started a discussion on Amazon.com with the low carb folks.Unfortunately, they keep insisting on their false claims and even ridicule Dr. Greger, which I mentioned as a good point against low-carb.http://www.amazon.com/review/RYI6B7XSDRSRJ/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307474259&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=#wasThisHelpfulIt is under the 1 star reviews for Taubes’ “Why we get fat” book.regards, DanielI enjoyed reading that rant although you should consider avoiding trying to debate people who are so attached to their ideas. Dr. Greger’s work has completely changed my life when I randomly stumbled across his DVD’s over 3 years ago (way before this site was up.) Whenever I showed them to people, they would always have excuses about why this isn’t practical or even claim that there is some sort’ve agenda behind the creation of this project. Many people find veganism (or even just vegetarianism) an attack on their ego. For these people, it is best to just smile and wish them well. Thanks for sharing Daniel!I am a plant-strong vegan. However, I find that weight GAIN is next to impossible! Everything vegan/vegetarian-related seems to be geared toward LOSING weight (including this wonderful site). I (and those around me) find that I am MUCH too skinny and I don’t like it at all. I’ve been trying hopelessly to find a way to gain weight without success. I’ve tried adding more calories, eating more food and excercising less to no avail. There’s just not enough time in a busy day to make, cook and prepare a vegan diet anymore AND find that I’m a bony toothpick! :) I’m fighting an uphill battle every day. It’s frustrating and I apologize for my rant.The image in Dr. Greger’s video above shows a comparison of different foods and their volumes/sizes with the same amounts of calories. But it’s a bit misleading as most of the larger volume of veggies/fruits in the image contains WATER and FIBER, which is what makes them so large…equals NO contribution to weight gain…and that’s my issue.Please share what your typical-day meals look like, and your exercise schedule.also your body weight and heightHi Keiki,I’m 5’10” and about 145lbs; late 30’s. I no longer do any excercising. I’ve calculated that I eat a daily whole-plant-based diet that contains about 2,500-3,000 calories. Whole grained cereals, berries, soy milk, nuts, fruits, natural peanut butter sandwiches on Ezekiel breads, lots of teas, crackers, steamed veggies, pastas and beans comprise most of my diet every day. Thanks, FrankHey Frank! I suggest that you log what you eat using a site like cronometer dot com. It’s very easy to estimate you’re eating 3000cals, while in fact you might be eating much less!If I wanted to gain weight I’d move slowly towards the 5000 cals threshold, because eating more than 3000 cals is actually a hella lot of work :) Then log your weight monthly while eating 4000 cals a day, 4500 cals a day, 5000 cals – always use something like cronometer to have a good estimate of your cals. If possible eat more cals of the good stuff – fruits and veggies! :DDon’t give up and good luck! :)Hi Keiki, thanks for the reply! Great info and I should definitely try out the calorie logging website. One issue with trying to gain weight from fruits and veggies is that you get satiated VERY quickly from them AND they have such little calories that you’ll need to eat a LOT of them (they contain so much water and fiber). So, it’s a catch-22 situation: need to eat a lot, but you’ll feel too full very fast. Also, eating more nuts and seeds (calorie-dense foods), as Dr. Greger has mentioned in a recent video on nuts vs weight-gain, does little to nothing for weight-gain! So…I’m stuck :(Up the good fats! I found I have a very similar problem as I tend to border on the underweight side of things. But when I ‘up’ the fats suchs as nuts, seeds, avocados I find I gain weight. Try putting some pine nuts through your pastas, put a scoop of almond butter in your smoothies (or try an avocado smoothie), spinkle seeds on everything.. Or just snack on almonds throughout the day.. You could also try some muscle-building exercises. Good luck!There’s nothing wrong with being on the slim side of things. I myself am a competitive climber and have a body fat percentage of 5%. This does not necessarily mean that I am underweight. If you are getting the essential fat, basically enough omegga 3, (1.1 grams for woman and 1.6 grams for men) then you will be fine. You wont expect yourself to whither away, as long as your eating enough calories for energy, this will never be an issue.On the nutrient density and price per serving table, grain comes out cheap but looks pretty poor for nutrients. Does this mean, besides fiber, my oatmeal is the least nutrient filled food I’m eating?Fiber is also important and oats sure beat a lot of standard breakfast fare hands down, but it’s not as loaded with nutrients like fruit and veggies no. You could improve your oats with fruit or put oats in a smoothie if you want. I also use it as a vehicle for my daily scoop of omega’s (chia, hemp, flax). It is also important to vary your fare, so oats are a healthy addition to your otherwise veggie/fruit diet.can I please have a link to the nutrient price per serving chart?I wonder though how the pricing changes when its organic vs. conventional processed junk food. We buy only organic whole foods (occasional organic chicken and wild fish) and our grocery costs are crazy! I blame alot on the fact that not many stores closeby carry a wide selection with a good price, and even local markets and CSAs are still quite costly.think about this, my friends and co-workers are always saying they can’t afford organic and ask how i can afford it (since i make just above poverty level income) they buy lunch and coffee just about every day, if you figure they’re spending $15 a day just on lunch and coffee alone, that’s approximately $450 a month on that alone!!! i spend between $400-450 on ALL of my food, breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, dessert drinks, because i make it all myself and brown bag every day. And i never have to go to the doctor, they get sick quite often and have to go to the doctor, that’s way more money than i’m spending…and i do eat organic and free range, fish and meat. I do NOT eat any kind of soy since it’s bad for your thyroid and messes up your hormones.Simone, how do you pay the rest of your bills if you spend $450/month on food? You make just above poverty level income? I’m trying to make it on $1K/month and needs some tips? You must not have a transportation budget.Have you seen Dr. Greger’s videos here on the healthfulness of non gmo soy. The research shows it is really good for you…. Does not mess up your hormones and is not bad for your thyroid. It helps prevent cancer and prevents the return of cancer (breast) if eaten regularly.Did Dr Greger say that GMO soy was particularly different in that respect?The link for the USDA report doesn’t work. I’d really like to read it. Can you fix that? ThanksWorking for me. Anyone else having problems? http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/600474/eib96_1_.pdfworks for me, just takes an age or two to load.what do you eat on a daily basic?Veggies, Fruit, Whole-grains, Nuts, Seeds, Tea, Coffee, Spices, and Water-with sometimes supplements of B12 and D3 and iodine.Wakame seaweed is a good source of iodine and tasty too! There’s a video here about seaweeds pros and consGreat nutrition for your buck, but at the end of the day you still need to match your caloric needs if you do not want to lose weight.If your eating whole plant foods, especially starchy whole plant foods like whole grains, beans, potatoes, oats, brown rice, etc., there is no need to count calories as long as you eat when your hungry till your full. The foods listed in this video can be easily incorporated with starchy meals.My point was that you do need to match your caloric needs if you do not want to lose weight whether you count calories or not. Healthy foods might be cheaper per “portion” but you need more portions to get enough calories.Why count anything? Just eat WFPB and be healthy and happy whilst spending less at the market. WAY less if you can manage to grow some of your own. Also, the # of folks in westernized societies who “do not want to lose weight” is extraordinary low. We’re trying to steer some SAD eaters to a new understanding of health via nutrition.My point is you cannot look solely at nutrition without looking at energy. You are not actually spending less because nobody eats until 100% of daily nutrition is met. People eat until they have had enough energy or volume or nutritional value. Eating WFPB will make sure you land on your ideal weight. But if you want to compare costs with other foods you should look at more properties of the food beside just the nutritional values. I mean in other video’s WFPB is touted as better because it has more nutritional value per calorie, but when it’s convenient we do not look at the calories because that would skew the picture. I do not think that is fair.Yeah, I’m not going to quibble over the finest points. I’ll accept your analysis but I don’t think that is going to help folks turn away from SAD. That is my big concern, trying to get friends and family to treat their bodies to a more supportive/less destructive way of eating and possibly enjoy the benefits of a healthy weight and avoiding the Western diseases. Call me simple 8-p. CheersIf you need more calories just eat more calorie dense plant foods such as potatoes, rice, pasta, beans, corn or grains. These foods have fiber, are still loaded with nutrients and will give you plenty of energy. What is the alternative? Eat animal foods for more calories? Those foods have no fiber and nowhere near the nutrients of plant-based foods.

What is the best way to get my blood pressure down. I ate very well(vegan), cook from scratch, no soft drinks, butter, and all the bad stuff. triglyceride, HDL, LDL are all good but the blood pressure wont go down. i drink lot of hibiscus tea and exercise regularly and thinking about drinking more coconut water but i want to know what you think. Pls help. Love what you do.Hi, i am not Dr. Greger but i sow your coment and i hope i can help, i am 24 now, and i had the blood preasure problem…not anymore :) if i might give you some advice about that tricky devil which made me go nuts trying to lower it for a long time. – Stop using salt at all for a couple a days, and see if the salt is the reason, is hard, i know but is an experiment you need to make yourself so you can decide to regulate sodium intake ,as efectively as you can(NOTICE MY MISTAKE : Soy souce is full of salt i used it a lot in salad dressing, keep truck of the hidden salt in foods. Notice when you measure your blood preassure(NOTICE M.M. :I eat a lot and allways after lunch i get my B.P. up 500ml greet tea, 500 ml hibiscus tea, a cup of cocoa, a cup of amla powder, sometims coffee < which is great, but experiment and see mabie the too much fluids you intake might be the cause of you H.B.P. that your body try to flush from your kidneys through urinating as soon, which is cool, but dont forget, that with a vegan diet we intake extra fluids from fruits and vegetable( which consist of 90% of water by themself, and the thing which you might think is a bit off i left for last, meditation…i know is wiard but for me all of these togather was the answer to my HBP and to my high Cholesterol and LDL.. http://www.helpguide.org&lt; sorry for my english, but i live in greece, stay well :)Bjurni Selfo, Although I had been severly overweight for years, I never had a blood pressure problem, partially because I rarely ate processed foods. If I did, I bought the lowest salt content I could find and put the salt shaker on the table for my husband (he has severely low blood pressure and will pass out unless he uses a huge amount of salt). However I did have high cholesterol as I learned when the hospital physician looking for ways to increase my bill order blood tests. My bad cholesterol was 300. He immediately put me on drugs, and I reacted. So he put me on more drugs to reduce the reaction, and I reacted to them. Finally, I insisted that I immediately change my diet and began to eat vegan and by the time I was released from the rehab unit, my cholesterol was (temporarily) closer to normal.It went up after I left the hospital while I was learning how to season foods without butter, avocado, coconut, and learning how to reduce my meat consumption. But, I was still eating wild Alaskan salmon, which made me feel better, but still contained cholesterol. With this chat room, I learned to truly eat vegan. (Fish has not been eaten for nearly a 1 1/2 years now, and my cholesterol is still about 100.I recommend learning how to season without salt –use herbs instead. Garlic also helps in two ways. It seems to open the arteries and allow the blood to flow more freely and other online physicians say it reduces blood cholesterol. I use fresh garlic often with ginger and turmeric root because they reduce pain and inflammation as well as Advil, but without the damage to the stomach.. BTW, seafood as in fish are fine. Seafood as in shell fish are high in cholesterol. Greece serves a lot of shellfish. It may be tough, but limit your consumption. I’m originally from Colorado and ate mostly beef. If I can reduce beef from my diet, you can reduce shell fish.Hope this helps.Thank you for your advice, but as i said, it was 325 until 5 or 6 months ago, now it must be under 150 and keeps going down :) and i feel very proud of it, and all this thanks to Dr. Greger advices and research :) , It is in worlds conception that we eat a lot of seafood here in greece, but that is not true, we do eat seafood as fish and shellfish, but not much, for matter of fact i dont know anyone who eats more than once a week and most of the time not even that, and in small portions, i know people corelate Greece>Mediteranean diet and seafood , but unfortunately that is not the case in now days people here eat a loooot of meat, with the most used meat to be pork, and if you come to greece you will see a loooot of obesity, i understood this is dificoult to digest but this is just how reality is here:) (By the way, i am speaking for the majority of the people not all of them, i live in a big city so that is what i have in minde.We loved our stay in Greece, and your Feta and lamb was outstanding, especially compared to the way animals are fed in the USA. U.S. meat animals are often fed corn and soy created in a laboratory with genetically modified organisms of another species like E-coli bacteria, soil pathogens or viruses. And now increasingly, GMO grasses, alfalfa, or hay. It is natural for livestock to eat “grasses”. All meat from farm raised fish, to cattle, pork, rabbits, lamb and everything in between are often grown in factory conditions that never see the light of day, are unable to stretch their legs, treated cruely by farm laborers who increase the risk of illness and pain to the animals.I no longer eat meat, Feta or seafood. Instead, I eat chick peas (garbanzo beans), lentils, cannellini and other beans with rice, quinoa, and various whole grains with lots of veggies, dark leafy greens, root veggies, tomatoes, basil, and various herbs and mints. But nothing tasted as delicious as the fresh vegetables grown without petrochemical pest controls, the fresh Feta cheeses at the little cafes where we stopped in Athens, on the isle of Rhodes, and on Thera and Mykonos, when we left the paths of the tourists and explored.Yes, we saw many overweight Greeks. But, we Americans are becoming the most obese people on the planet and our dietary problems are similar. Too many desserts, too much meat and cheese and not enough veggies, whole grains, and beans. And way too much sitting and not exercising. How life has changed from both of our ancestors.I visited Greece after I had a total knee replacement (fractured hip was replaced a year before), but the combination made walking difficult at best. And, there was so much walking. Whenever possible, my husband hired a car to take me to a specific place where I waited and sipped a fruit softee while he toured the Isle of Mykonos. I longed to visit the windmills, but found them beyond my reach, unable to walk that far so I sat and photographed them from afar. We would have loved to move to Mykonos, just from that one day we spent there.The first time I was ever obese was when I lived in Greece from ’83-’85. Greeks consume a LOT of olive oil, which is high in calories, as well as a lot of bread. Greeks do eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, which is the positive aspect of theri diet. Yes, America has the highest obesity rate in the world, but Greece is not far behind at 5th in the world. Greece also has a very high smoking rate. My stepmother is from there and her sister recently died of lung cancer, as she was a chain smoker, as many Greek are.You are correct. Greeks (and Italians) eat a lot of olive oil and while it is healthier than butter, it is still fat, which accumulates if not enough exercise occurs.I find it easier to reduce my fat consumption than increase my exercise although, I need to get away from my computer and exercise more often.And yes, there is a very high rate of smoking in Greece, Turkey and throughout most of the continent as well as in Russia, and China. My father did not die of lung cancer, although he was a chain smoker. He had heart problems and died of another mysterious cancer. He developed a fast growing brain cancer. The tumor was the size of an ostrich egg and turned him into a vegetable after it was removed. Within a week, the tumor grew back and he died.The air and water of Denver, Colorado is so toxic that after my father’s death and college, I moved to the mountains. My brother and moved moved to D.C. I think government secrecy was part of the reason for my father’s death. Experiments were done on people without their knowledge, and then there was the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, a chemical weapons manufacturing center, cloaked in government secrecy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_Arsenal. My father often visited friends who lived in the proximity. Both of his friends also died of mysterious cancers.Many Americans have stopped smoking, but cancers continue, even lung cancers occur to non-smokers. Some non-smokers spray petrochemical pest controls, others use other solvents which increase the risk.This planet is increasingly become toxic; it’s not just Greece.Then you are lucky you didnt visit Santorini, cos you wouldnt have left from there, i live in Crete by the way, which is the biggest island of greece.And you are right, we do have a lot of fresh food here, but that is overpriced cos is not much that is why we import a lot, we do have live stock, sheep being the most, but it is not many if you compear it to the population so we import most of meat from holland, macedonia, and new zeland.And i can imagin the industrialized pig farms in holland and lamb and sheep in new zeland.The problem is that everything is getting industrialized and stufed with hormones and insecticides so they can compeat the price of the market, as a friend of mine sayed once, and he is a farmer, that he’s cocambers grow in one night just popping up like ballons, and he saied that you can actualy hear the sound of poping and growing when he spray them with some hormones so they can grow fast, and the grow like water ballon, and fish…..well we do have a lot of fish but most of it that you will finde in the market is from fishfarms just a few is from the sea and a lot more from import, cos they get more profit selling the ‘Greek Catch’ at other countries and selling the import at greece with higher price…i know is crazie and i dont want to disapoint you, but i realized all this when i noticed my cholesterol level going crazie when i was working to the hotel i used to work, where the food was amaizingly deliciouse, and i could eat plenty of ‘fresh fish’ from farms and fresh ‘shell fish’ from california and delicious lamb chops from New zeland…Freshly Frozen ;)But thanks to NutritionFacts i start realizing what is going on. and was dificoult at first, but now only veggies, fruits and legumes, nuts and seeds :) and my doctor got shoked when he sow the ldl and hdl level in just one month of a healthy vegan diet, my HDL doubled and my Chilesterol felt by 50 points per month almost, but as i sayed, cos of healthy vegan and not just vegan, cos i tried just vegan and didnt work even half as good as with the tip’s of Dr.Greger on nuts, seeds , beverages, spices and categorizing the veggies and fruits in healthy, healthier and super duper healthy :)We did spend the day in Santorini. My husband downloaded my images to a CD while I sat in a restaurant overlooking the Aegean Sea and the community of Fira.If I would have been able to walk, I would have had more of an affinity for this place, as it is so picturesque, and such a wonderful place to explore. It would have been even better if we could have spent the night on Santorini, but with a new knee replacement and placing most of my weight on a cane, walking the streets would have been treacherous for me. Check out a couple of my snapshots at: http://tinyurl.com/ckazq3m and http://tinyurl.com/c4rvd2mWell, i wish your knee is not a truble to you anymore to walk and travell, there are plenty of places around the world to visit and explore.So i guess if you couldnt walk, then you couldnt visit the Red, the Black and the White beach, mabie another time :)Hi Kobby,Do you limit your sodium? I am sure you do. But you didn’t mention it.Do you eat cheese? Cheese is not only high in cholesterol, but it’s high in salt content. My fingers hurt when I eat cheese. I can sense my arteries clogging. Fresh garlic helps reduce that sensation, but avoidance of shellfish, and eating vegan has really helped keep my cholesterol under control.I don’t know if coconut water is high in cholesterol. I recall reading that the “meat” of coconut is very high in cholesterol.http://www.livestrong.com/article/520888-side-effects-of-organic-coconut-oil/?utm_source=livestrong_opar&utm_medium=5Since there is so much confusion on coconuts, I wonder if the pro benefits are funded by vested interests. As for now, I err on the side of precaution, and avoid foods that are laden with controversy.There is no cholesterol in coconut water or coconut meat. No plant products contain any appreciable amounts of cholesterol. Since coconut oil is high in saturated fat, that might increase one’s cholesterol level, but that’s due to the saturated fat. There is no cholesterol in coconut oil.Of note (in relation to this video), it seems likely that coconut water (like flax and soy) contains phytoestrogens: http://rdo.psu.ac.th/sjstweb/journal/28-5/01-young-coconut-juice.pdfHypertension seems to correlate better with a high sodium-to-potassium ratio than it does with sodium alone. See Sodium and Potassium in the Pathogenesis of Hypertension, N Engl J Med 2007; 356:1966-1978 http://www.eglobalmed.com/opt/AmedeoLiteratureGuide/content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/356/19/1966.pdf for a review. So its also important to eat a high-potassium diet. Beans, tomatoes, potatoes, greens and yes bananas are all good sources, but be wary of the sodium added to canned vegetables.There are several salt substitute products on the market but most contain potassium chloride. Finding a low-potassium salt substitute is challenging, because there are few available. My mother used to use Morton Lite-Salt, which contains 50 percent less sodium than regular salt because it is blended with potassium chloride. It also contains iodine, an essential nutrient. Lite Salt has less potassium than other substitutes because it is mixed with sodium chloride. And, Morton warns that this product should NOT BE USED if you are on a sodium- or potassium-free diet.Read more: http://www.livestrong.com/article/379849-low-potassium-salt-substitutes/#ixzz2QC8CIk4WAlso, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SaltHow much sodium (salt) do you eat? Canned foods can have a lot. Check labels. Salt raises blood pressure within minutes.Salt is the reason my father’s blood pressure was high; and despite my weight, not using salt is the reason my blood pressure is very low! Physicians often have nurses check it twice, on each arm and are so surprised when my blood pressure shows a very low reading.Hence, I would say to avoiding salting your food, avoid buying processed foods, which are often highly salted. And instead adding celery, of which 1 cup chopped is 96mg of sodium, instead of salting foods.If you buy miso, beware it’s very high in sodium. I always buy Eden OrganicShiro Miso, Organic Rice & Soybean, which has the lowest sodium content of all I’ve seen, but the number is still quite high. So, I use a smaller amount and dilute.Processed foods contain lots of sodium/salt.Blood pressure is a common problem in todays society mostly because of the lifestyle we live with processed foods, little exercise and high stress loads. However here re some things to consider: 1. Do you really have high blood pressure? Blood pressure normally fluctuates during the day due to variations in activities, stress and hormones. So, to b sure you have high blood pressure see a health care professional to have it checked. Your family physicians office has the proper equipment to verify your pressure. 2. Use dietary and lifestyle changes to reduce and maintain healthy blood pressure. Limit salt intake to recommended milligram amounts established by your healthcare provider. Limiting salt intake may mean reducing or eliminating processed foods such as microwavable meals, convenience foods, deli foods, condiments such as ketchup, and canned soups/foods. Most salt intake is consumed in processed foods when sodium is added for taste and preservation to food during production. 3. After consulting with your family physician, start an age and health appropriate exercise routine. Walking is a great form of exercise with many health benefits, the most important being it strengthens the heart over time. Startslow as directed by your Doctor. 4. Add heart healthy herbs and spices to your diet. Garlic is known to improve blood pressure. However, consult your physician to prevent any medication conflicts. 5. Avoid dehydration. Dehydration can cause blood pressure fluctuations. 6. Dont smoke or eat cured or preserved meats. They are high in sodium. 7. Sleep enough hours each night appropriately for your health and age. Poor sleep can elevate stress hormones and elevate blood pressure. 8. Remove chemicals from your environment as much as possible. 9. Take time to participate in a leisure activity you enjoy. 10. Eliminate sources of conflict in your life. Conflict causes stress and can elevate blood pressure. Good luck-11. Dont consume caffiene or stimulating beverages. Coffee has large amounts of caffiene that can elevate blood pressure and energy drinks also. Even herbal teas can have caffiene and stimulating substances that can elevate blood pressure. Its best to eliminate them from your diet completely until your blood pressure is under control and your Doctor has determined its safe to reintroduce them to your diet in liited amounts. 12. Evaluate all herbal and over the counter substances and medications you are using for potential bood pressure elevating effects. Many over the counter medications can elevate your blood pressure. Some herbs can also elevate your blood pressure and can even increase risk of stroke.. even vitamins today are being formulated with herbs in them. 13. Discuss magnesium supplementation with your doctor. Magnesium can help reduce blood pressure when taken responsiblly as directed by your doctor. Your doctor may require a blood test to check your magnesium levels prior to supplementation. 14.Eat more potatoes. Potatoes are high in potassium, a mineral that relaxes blood vessel walls and reduces blood pressure. However, do not attempt potassium supplementation without direction and supervision from your doctor. Potassium supplements can reduce blood pressure to dangerously low levels if not used responsiblly.Good luck-15. Discuss niacin supplementation with your Doctor, niacin works to relax vessel walls nd reduce blood pressure, however as with any supplements or medications, discuss it with your doctor first for recommendations.Whew! I think thats enough to get you started. If lifestyle and dietary changes are not sufficient to normalize your blood pressure, then your cardiologist or primary physician will take the appropriate action to ensure your good health, which may include prescription beta blockers or other appropriate action. You may also want to see an endocrinologist if your blood pressure is difficult to control. There are tests an endocrinologist can do to determine if your high blood pressure is related to an endocrine problem. Certain endocrine disorders can elevate blood pressure as can kidney disease or even adrenal/kidney tumors.Wish you all the best – :)Data like this is so clear to me. Yet when I tried to share these videos with someone who is on Tamoxafin (sp?) and has gone through all the treatments for breast cancer, she said that flaxseeds have too much phytoestrogens in them for her to eat them. They were “counter-indicated”. Obviously, this is what her doctor and/or nutritionist is telling her. I understand why she feels she has to listen to them, but the situation drives me nuts. I wish more people could understand what the science is telling us.Thea,Your comments are always great and relevant.The problem is that in medschool you learn absolutely nothing about nutrition, diet and the relation to disease – and definitely nothing about treating/improving a disease with diet. NOTHING!And ask dr. Greger or John McDougall what happens if you mention diet and disease in a big fancy hospital…And look: Surgery is sexy, prescribing drugs is cool, and a MD talking about broccoli and seeds must be nuts……;-)Trust the minority – not the majority……Medical schools also do not teach physicians which questions to ask when someone has been exposed to pesticides, nor do they teach how to treat patients for pesticide poisoning.One physician to which I went said it was all in my mind. I did not return to him. If I know more than the doctor, that is a sad situation. Pesticide poisoning mimics symptoms/conditions of other diseases. Having numbness, tickling, tingling, burning, pricking, of a person’s skin with no apparent reason does not mean that one is lacking B-12. It may mean exposure to volatile organic compounds, including pesticides. This is especially true when a patent brings with them the container of the product they were using.Sometimes toxicological screening tests may not show what has occurred, as I found when I was exposed to DDVP, which has since been banned because it caused sterility in men. It was not banned because I coughed up blood for nearly a year, nor that I experienced cognitive damage including the inability to add up simple numbers, assemble easy puzzles, or remember the reasons for my actions. Those were blamed on my not paying attention.It takes a physician that is trained in toxicology to properly diagnose some one who has been poisoned, and one does not have to drink the chemical compound to experience these reactions.I also had similar reactions when overly exposed to Minwax chemical floor stripper, which permeated the gloves I was wearing and wetted my hands including fingers. But it was my breathing problems that put my occupational toxicologist trained internal medicine physician into action mode. I could exhale, but not completely inhale and either way, the breathing was shallow, not deep. This particular physician knew exactly what should be immediately done and went into emergency mode.beccadoggie10: You have been through so much in your life. Your post is inspiring to me, though. You clearly stayed strong and advocated for yourself. That’s not easy. Good for you.I sincerely feel that the only reason I’m still alive is because of eating certified organic non-processed foods since 1986. Most of the chemical poisoning occurred in 1982 and 1999. Since 1999, I’ve tried very hard to avoid toxic shampoos, pharmaceuticals, and other products. Not always successful however.Recently, my hair dresser “fired me” because I insulted him, saying that he gave me a bad hair cut. Before he fired me, he insisted on washing my hair with his shampoo, something I rejected for years, but desperately needed a hair cut.My scalp burned for 3 days thereafter, even though the first thing I did when arriving home was to wash my hair again. (It had been washed in baking soda and Dr. Bronner’s gentle liquid soap prior to going, but that wasn’t good enough for him.) After the burning stopped, the itching began.Cosmetics, alike shampoos are NOT regulated by the federal government. Read the Environmental Working Group report, Skin Deep on shampoo. http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/browse/shampoo/But, in the mean time, he told me never to come back again. And, after that episode, of his ignoring my wishes three times (once with his toxic shampoo because he insisted he wash my hair after I just washed it, and another time when he blew my hair dry before I drove to the pool where I took physical therapy and had to be swimming) and then charged me extra for this.I was willing to pay him not to wash my hair and not to blow it dry, but he refused.I have no desire to ever return or recommend him to anyone.Hey Doc, thanks for the kind words!re: “And look: Surgery is sexy, prescribing drugs is cool, and a MD talking about broccoli and seeds must be nuts” You made me laugh. :-)I’m glad there are doc like you around.State hospitals are funded by either the chemical or pharmaceutical industry, which are basically the same thing. The economy is run of prescribing pharmaceuticals, or pushing surgery, and making people sick.I am chemically sensitive thanks to exposures to volatile organic compounds which are also in aerosols and the Swifter floor cleaners which the hospital cleanup crew used. They made me dizzy, spaced out, and like on was in a brain fog. But, it was against hospital policy that I bring my air purifier from home which reduced VOCs in my ambient environment. Instead, they pushed drugs! Drugs I had never taken before in my life. And with reactions to drugs meant layering me on additionally drugs. By the time I checked out two weeks later, I was on 10 drugs that I never had before in my life (and did NOT renew).When I requested steamed broccoli, I received mushy, pressure cooked broccoli without nutrients. When I refused to eat meat because it contained cholesterol, the physician prescribed unseasoned beans and white rice (without fiber or the nutrients, which are in brown rice); the hospital would not even let me used garlic, ginger or turmeric. Yuk! It was awful but I did not want drugs. Everyone else welcomed friend chicken, but I refused to eat it.When I wanted to be on the rehab floor after receiving a total knee replacement the following year, I was told that I would have to have my good knee replaced to be on the floor. That makes no sense whatsoever. There was and is still nothing wrong with my good knee. Plus, the life span of a prosthesis is only 10 years.In a way, I hope they do reduce Medicare and reduce the unnecessary surgeries that most people have. People can reduce the inflammation and pain without surgery and drugs, using exercise, water therapy, and fresh herbs (garlic, ginger, and turmeric). I just did not know that then. Plus, my injured knee kept leaving the cradle. I would suddenly become detached while walking with a cane and did not dare walk without a cane.If you have to go into the hospital again, tell them you are a vegan – or at least a vegetarian. Request salads and lots of raw vegetables. (bring your own seasonings, shhhh…)Salads and most raw veggies do not have all the nutrients we need when eating vegan. We also need whole grains and beans/lentil/legumes to make complimentary proteins. I get very hungry just eating veggies. Plus, what I discovered in the hospital is they consider lettuce a healthy veggie. Lettuce is basically water, and there is little nutrition in it. It’s not like a dark, leafy green. I hope I never have to go to the hospital again. It’s a very toxic place.Phytoestrogens are good things, not bad things. They fill up your estrogen receptor sites and protect you from common female diseases caused by having too much estrogen.Very interesting! Do you know if they used whole flax seed or ground flax seed? I have read that whole flaxseed doesn’t get digested so if that is true, would whole flax seed have these benefits?1/4 cup ground flax seed per day. You can read it in the report he put on the screen, and he says it in the video. I recommend you grind it fresh in a little coffee grinder and add it to your daily green smoothie.It was ground flaxseed – Just 1 tablespoon with breakfast.I just googled “flaxseed nausea” and got a lot of hits… apparently I’m not alone. Wish I knew why, though – or some sort of work-around.tzulu, your reaction is a serious bummer. It’s nice to know you are not alone, but it would be even nicer not to have a flaxseed problem.On the plus side, your diet that you described above sounds so amazingly healthy. I am in awe. I think you are doing all that you can to take care of yourself.A thought: If I understood your original post correctly, it sounds like you can tolerate some amount of flaxseed, just not as much as a tablespoon a day. So, I wonder if your body is responding to flaxseed the way other people respond to beans when they aren’t used to eating them. On that theory, then, you might be able to start with small amounts of flaxseed (a half teaspoon a day?) and slowly work your way up to more. Maybe?This is just a wild, lay-persons idea. I’m not saying I know what is going on or if it will work or not. It just seems like in your case, trying to work the flaxseed into your diet would be worth the effort – IF you can do so without making yourself miserable.My other thought was that some people react flatulent-ly to beans because they don’t have the right gut bacteria to process it. I wonder it that is possible (hard to imagine given your healthy diet) if you simply lack the gut bacteria to process flax and maybe that could be fixed.The purpose of this post is just to try to provide some support. Good luck!Thanks so much for your thoughtful response, Thea. I think I will try your suggestion of adding it slowly back into my daily diet. And the gut flora issue had crossed my mind. I can only imagine what affects the chemo could have had system wide – there too, I assume? I have started including probiotics with that in mind. Thanks again!One tablespoon with breakfast is doable. I could also add some to a fast scratch muffin recipe to get my husband to eat some, as well.Can anyone advise me – I seem to be Flaxseed intolerant???I have included a tablespoon of ground flaxseed occasionally in my diet and have recently I tried to increase that to a daily tablespoon and have experienced extreme bloating and nausea – to the point that I was barely able to eat on those days… I also was experiencing constipation. In general, I would describe my diet as excellent; I am entirely vegan, approximately 70% raw. I was prescribed Tamoxifen, but had to stop taking that because of unbearable side affects. I am relieved to stop taking it anyhow – So tired of all of the chemo treatments!I soak 2 tablespoons of whole flax seeds overnight and eat them with my breakfast. Maybe this will help.That study is from 2005. With tumor reduction levels like that, why haven’t we heard more about it since then?If women consume 1/4 cup of flaxseeds per day, can we can PREVENT breast cancer?We are neglecting sesame seed here which is usually more easily digested. A mixture of flax and sesame is possibly best as it balances omega 3s and 6s.Nutr Cancer. 2012;64(1):65-71. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2012.630165. Epub 2011 Dec 2.Comparative effects of sesame seed lignan and flaxseed lignan in reducing the growth of human breast tumors (MCF-7) at high levels of circulating estrogen in athymic mice.AbstractFlaxseed (FS) has a breast tumor-reducing effect, possibly because of its high content of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) lignan. Sesame seed (SS) is rich in the lignan sesamin (SES) but is non-protective. Both lignans are metabolized to estrogen-like enterodiol and enterolactone. The objective of this study was to differentiate the effects of SDG and SES on established human estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors (MCF-7) in athymic mice with high serum estrogen to help explain the different effects of FS and SS. Mice were fed for 8 wk the basal diet (BD, control) or BD supplemented with 1 g/kg SDG or SES. SES reduced palpable tumor size by 23% compared to control, whereas SDG did not differ from SES or control. Both treatments reduced tumor cell proliferation, but only SES increased apoptosis. SDG and SES reduced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and endothelial growth factor receptor expressions, but only SES reduced downstream pMAPK. Neither treatment affected IGF-1R, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, Akt, pAkt, or MAPK of the growth factor signaling pathway. Thus, at high serum estrogen levels, SDG may not account for the tumor reducing effect of FS. SES was more effective than SDG in reducing breast tumor growth, but its effect may have been lost when consumed as a component of SS.Dr. Gregor,In this test study, were the participants eating a heathy diet in addition to the flax seed or were they eating the typical standard diet?Also, do you have a recipe that has the right amount of flax seed in each muffin, or can you take any muffin recipe and add the right amount of ground flax seed without ruining the recipe?For a 1 dozen muffin recipe, that would be about 3 cups of flaxseed. I’m interested in this because I have a friend that has breast cancer and would like to find a tasty, healthy muffin recipe to offer her.Thanks for all your helpful videos. I just subscribed about a month ago and it’s great getting nutritional studies to watch and listen to in my box each morning. Much nicer than having to always read everything. What a great idea!WAIT A MINUTE! If I ate 1/4 cup of flaxseed everyday I would have to LIVE in the bathroom. Important question – was that ground flax seeds or whole flax seeds? They do completely different things on their way to their final destination.Ground flaxseed is always best, but flaxseeds are not laxatives. Yes they are high in fiber but so is nearly every other plant food. Flaxseeds are not exceptionally unique in this way.How much flax seed is needed per day to achieve these results?Dr. Greger recommends 2-3 tablespoons of ground flaxseed per dayWhat about cooking (muffins) with flaxseed. Doesn’t cooking destroy the benefits of flaxseeds?Dr. Greger,Do you have a comparison between golden and brown flaxseeds?In another video he states that there is no difference in performance between the colors.Enjoy the taste of pumpkin pie, minus the baking, fat, and calories of your standard pie plus the benefits of flaxseed meal.Wannabe Pumpkin Pie Filling– 1 banana, mashed – 2 tbsp flaxseed meal – 1 tsp Ceylon cinnamon http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/ – Pinch ground ginger – Pinch nutmeg – Pinch ground clovesMash all ingredients together and feel good about enjoying this antioxidant-rich, pumpkin-pie-filling-esque treat as a healthy snack or dessert.~Complements of lovestobeveganWill Flax Seed Oil in capsule form has equal benefit as Flax Sees. How much quantity of 500mg of Flax Seed Oil capsules will be required for a day for consumption by a Breast Cancer patient?I would think you would get more benefit from the ground seeds if you were going to choose between the oil and ground seeds.Dear Doctor,Thanks very much  for the reply Warm regards, Dana BabuA large part of the benefits from flax seeds comes from the fiber content. Oil has no fiber. It is not a whole food. I grind enough flax seed for the week so that i don’t have to grind each day, and store bulk seeds in the refrigerator.I am on chemo for breast cancer and my doctor just told me today to quit taking flax.

Have you come across many studies on this topic? would love to hear your thoughts :)Thank you for the daily nutrition update. I truly appreciate your assistance in helping improve my health while advocating a plant-based diet.Dr. Greger,Are there any foods that you would recommend for healthy weight gain?Ditto that! Since going vegan 2+ years ago, I feel great. But a bit too ‘delicate’ and ‘boney’ compared to my meat-eating self. Only a small problem to have in exchange for good health? Or can I gain some weight back on plant foods and still be really healthy?Beans are a great way to gain weight, lots of protein and calories. Sweet potaotes as well or any kind of potatoesThe easiest way to gain weight on any diet is to simply eat too many calories. I am a 26 year old male, became vegan one year ago. I weighed 132lbs and really didn’t want to go lower than that. I did though, 6 months in I was 128lbs and was having a really hard time putting any of it back on. One month ago I started using cronometer.com to track my caloric intake. You get a feel really fast as to which foods are contributing the most calories and even without putting in any thought, you naturally start choosing more of the dense foods over the light ones if that’s your goal. You learn to eat e bit more even if you’re not really hungry and your body slowly gets used to it. The goal is to try to add an extra 250 calories per day in order to gain half a pound per week. Easy peasy.I am now 135lbs and feeling really confident about being able to keep this up. I also exercise about 20 minutes each morning and ride my bike everywhere. You don’t want all those extra calories ending up in belly fat :)This is really interesting to me. I’m curious if more studies would continue to support this idea. Certainly dried fruits and nuts are healthy calorie-dense foods but it seems unlikely that the high calorie content wouldn’t have any effect on weight somewhere along the line.I am curious about the details of this study. I recall one of the nut studies Jeff Nelson let us know that the subjects were calorie restricted and that is why the addition of the nuts did not cause weight gain. They just kept modifying calorie intake to maintain weight. So Im curious who funded this study? (Larabar?) Who wrote up the article (corporation vs researcher)? And what was the diet and calorie content of the subjects?Tom: check out the “sources sited” section. It is collapsed by default. But if you click on the words to open the section, you will see that Dr. Greger gives you links so that you can follow up on details about studies that he references.But does it inhibit weight/fat loss?Would you comment on these two studies:http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1200303?query=featured_home&#t=articleMethodshttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16467234?dopt=AbstractSecond one is very intriguing… really!Hello Dr Greger, The apricots on you photo is orangeDried apricots have actually 3 types:Sulphured dried apricots (Orange color)Natural dried apricots (Dark brown color)Most common type of dried apricots are sulphur treated ones, which is applied before sun drying so it keeps the fresh color. The more you apply sulphur, dried apricots get brighter. Treating apricots with sulphur increase the shelf life, while making it’s taste worse (in my own opinion).Sulphur usage rate on dried apricots for Europe Union countries are 2000 ppm and for United States it is limited to 3000 ppm (brighter).Many people don’t know about that, but if you just lay apricots under the sun for drying without sulphur, color will get dark.Natural Dried Apricots are sweeter and have better taste because you don’t get the sulphur taste.What is your response to the other well-known vegan drs like McDougall and Essylstein who arduously advocate against all fat – even nuts and avocado. They have science, you have science – what do you think?What does all that sugar do to insulin level? Fiber isn’t always, if it ever is, the saving grace regarding insulin.What’s up with his weird speech pattern? The veeerrrryyyyyy strange way he draaaaaaws out words in an extremely annoying waaaaaay in a halting & unusually odd style????I like it!1:30 says “fried fruit”Doctor, is it okay to consume large quantities of dried fruit as I could fresh fruit? If not so well, then what is the problem/issue, and how may I prepare dried fruit to consume it similarly?It is easier to eat more calories of dried fruit than fresh fruit as they are more calorie dense. Generally eating fruits is not a problem. They contain fiber, phytonutrients, sugar, fructose and glucose. Some folks will experience a rise in triglycerides and/or cholesterol when consuming alot of fruit. So some caution is in order. It depends on what your goals are and how you react to the amount of dried fruit plus other lifestyle habits such as exercise… progressive weight training vs. aerobic. In general restricting fruit intake to about 4-5 servings per day is well tolerated. Some patients need to cut back others can get away with more. I don’t think there is a “right” answer to your question. Working with your health care provider who is knowledgeable about plant based nutrition might be something you should consider. dWhat about dehydrated and/or freeze-dried fruit and veggies? I’m curious about the nutritional profile of these foods and I can’t find a video on your site that covers these topics. Thanks! LOVE LOVE LOVE this website.Dr. I am a vegan and occasionally I have a Quest bar (protein bar). The company claims that these are high fiber/high protein bars with very little sugar. Have you heard anything regarding these bars as I somtimes need to supplement when I am too busy. ThanksHi Velk, I’m very familiar with Quest bars and might be able to lend some insight. The upside I’ve found is that they’re sweetened in part with erythritol, which appears harmless and doesn’t appear to cause gastrointestinal distress. Stevia is also used to sweetened many, but not all Quest bars, and as Dr. Greger points out, while some stevia can be harmless, too much can lead to genotoxicity. Of greater detriment, the 20 grams of milk protein Quest bars contain promote acne and may contribute to circulatory disorders and food allergies. There are also reports that Quest understates their caloric content by 20% and overstates fiber content by 750%. For these reasons, I might consider opting for something equivalently convenient when you’re busy like a handful of body composition-friendly nuts. I hope this helps!This is the wrong model.You need to add ad libitum of these foods, and check the results.Is there any known study regarding what would be the best fat:carbohidrate ratio per 100g of product to promote maximum weight gain in humans? I would assume farmers already know these ratios for different animals.Farmers load the animals full of antibiotics as a method of promoting weight gain, and also to offset horrid conditions. The “Hungry for Change” movie asserts that lab mice/rats are made fat by feeding them MSG.As far as humans go- who needs a study? Just follow the thunderous herd to the nearest dipped-in-oil-and-coated-with-sugar-meaty-mishmash of junk sold to us with smiles and slogans and coupons from every nook and corner of society. Also get a diet soda in a cup the size of a waste basket. Analyze it.Those Kind bars are so absolutely awesome for a cellophane wrapped product, but I they don’t fit my current budget at all. Nuts!Hey anybody have a good roll-your-own fruit and nut bar recipe? I’m about to experiment with dates, rolled oats, flaxseed, walnuts, pepitas, and spices. Have super-blender, but also want to keep some chunkiness to them.

It’s definitely not in the Schneider piece, tho. Thanks anyway! :-) It’s not really important, I was just curious.Curiosity is a good thing! ;-)I’ve added it into the supplementary info section above just for you!Thanks so much. Tic Tacs are practically like kale.Hey doc, thanks for wealth of info! What’s a coffee or tea whitener??Dinorah, I’m picking your from Aust/NZ? Down here we put milk in coffee. But before immigrating from USA we used “non-dairy” whiteners because you know, they were healthier than actual milk. It is a dried slurry of caseinate (so much for the non-dairy lie), saturated fats, emulsifiers, soy, silica gel and of course white paint. MmmmmThis is good to hear and hopefully true since many vegans have been able to enjoy the tasty Daiya cheese which has titanium dioxide in it.The larger message is the lack of principle and values in the food industry. It should go without saying that non-food should not be added to food. And yet we must say it. I know there will be exceptions that some will feel are important. Regardless I am opposed to being forced to analyze labels to decipher the weird crap the food industry does. Would you care for a little silica gel with your titania?BTW/ titantia is a photoelectric semiconductor substance. Of course there is not that much sunshine in the colon so I guess it is OK to eat this crap right?Hopefully eating it isn’t in fact a problem. Breathing it could very well be trouble.Please speak more on the matter of inhalation exposure to nano particles in personal care products. People are off-gassing this horrid stuff. Would Dr. Greger know of research studies? Are there any protective foods once one has been exposed?Sorry Fidel, but eating non food is not acceptable in this house.

With appreciation, RMMHello Dr.Greger what is your opinion on supplementing with digestive enzymes? Thank-youUnless specifically recommended by your doctor, I would advise against it. If you want a supplement for increased fecal bulking and bowel health then taking psyllium husk is a harmless option.So glad I have lost my desire (mostly) for prepared food. I am a pretty good “cook” so find it pretty easy to prepare some dandy dishes from scratch using only “from the ground or tree” foods. Now to find the best quality “organic” local and freshly picked produce. I have been toying with the Starch based diet, although find it harder to digest than the all produce all the time diet. I had some problems with that too, but feel it is cleaner. No telling where those grains and beans have been. My fave is sweet potatoes in a soup with onion, celery and cabbage. No whiteners there, but still, I can improve. So now that I am avoiding all these listed, bad actors, why do I still get so sick? How do I get that consistent good digestion? (You know what I mean.) Am I still suffering from all the years of bad additives? Been mostly vegetarian since 1980. That doesn’t mean I’ve been perfect, but I think it has helped me avoid a lot of the problems. Now that I’ve taken this post off track, I think I need to search your archives for some help. Thanks, LynnI was a vegan eating unprocessed organic foods for seven years when I acquired Ulcerative Colitis. I had my first symptoms after received the MMR vaccine. I am achieving remission by implementing the gaps protocol and eating LOTS of animal fats from grassfed good quality meats. A big adjustment for me, an exvegan.I cannot eat the high fiber vegan diet any longer without provoking bloody mucusy diarrhea. I cannot eat raw vegetables either. I think cutting out sugar and grains and eating lots of fats like high quality pastured butter, and coconut oils has helped my gut heal tremendously. Along with gelatin in bone broths. I have also lost fifty pounds since May 2012 eating this way.I don’t know how much research you’ve done but your vegan diet wasn’t the cause of your Ulcerative colitis. If thats what your saying? Just one place to get more info on it is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitisIf I go OFF my vegan diet I get colitis…. Sudden changes can cause your symptoms, but I doubt a long-term vegan (properly proportioned) is the cause of your symptoms. The GAPS diet would be better called the “suicide diet”. It consists mostly of items known to promote disease and death.diagnosed with CD, i have stopped taking all the dairy products, since then i have made lot of progress in the GUT “no pain” . can i replace with Almond MIlk from Dairy milk . please suggestthanks Dr Micheal greger , you are doing great Job , helping usI have two titanium hips, do I need to worry about this leeching into my system? I already have elevated cobalt and have just had 2nd blood test to see if it’s worse & if chromium is elevated.It’s not the titanium per se, it’s the physical form, the microparticles, that are touted to cause the problems. But if you watch the video carefully, there’s not much evidence to consider them harmful. Just don’t eat a huge amount of them. And don’t worry about your hips.I am really looking forward to your video on carrageenan. We are a vegan family and I have seen it in a couple of products we buy. The Cornucopia Institute recommends staying away from it and I would love to see what you think.Dr. Greger, Are the small titanium dioxide particles in sunscreens a potential problem? Are they small enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream?Thanks!DeanThankfully it doesn’t look like absorption on titanium dioxide from sunscreen is a problem – see PMID 20156837.DeanTitanium Dioxide is often added to Vitamins and supplements–I stopped taking Jarrow B complex because I noticed in contained titanium dioxide. I’ve stopped many supplements, but I’m essentially vegetarian and have to get B-12 from a supplement.Hi Martha, have you seen Dr. Greger’s response on where to get B12? http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/what-is-the-best-way-to-get-b12/ He usually recommends against supplements in preference of whole food nutrition, but there’s a few he does recommend and B12 is one of them! You can see other recommendations here: http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/Thank you so much for summarizing this data!

After a week or so I developed red spots all over my body’s lower half–called the doctor. He asked what was new and I described my cranberry food supplement addition. He advised me that each cranberry capsule has the chemistry of a pound of cranberries and that I had apparently set up a sensitivity to them in my body. He told me to stop taking them and be careful to not eat cranberry products since my body may have a reaction to them that could be worse. Once since then I drank 4 ounces of cranberry juice and the spots returned. I now avoid all ingestion of cranberries.I know this comment is off topic but it is an interesting experience with food supplements. Thanks for the broccoli endorsement–even if I have become a vegan it is interesting. It may deter even cancers caused by other sources as well. Dr. Colin Campbell once spoke at a book signing here in Austin. He mentioned that cancer causes are ubiquitous, and we encounter them in many ways. He said that they are like a seed. Whether they implant, root and grow depends on what you feed them. He pointed out that cancer prefers the casein protein as food. I decided to cut out dairy.Great post MIchael. I think the only point I would make about grilling veggies is that while you don’t need to worry about HCAs, you do need to be concerned about advanced glycation endproducts like acrylamides. Depends of course how long, how hot and how dry the grill is.I think this explaines why my caffeine craving has increased since becoming mostly vegan. Any less harmful alternatives to caffeine, or shall I just have a broccoli chaser with my espresso?I believe Dr. G would recommend green tea as a healthier alternative. See his videos on the topic.or Chaihi James! I went cold turkey 2 yrs ago and have never had a drop of coffee since. I was sick detoxing it out of my body for a week…food for thought as to just how addictive coffee really is….I do not miss ot at all and if I need a “pick me up” I drink water! I also drink lots of green juices – my fave is sliced “coins” of ginger & curcuma that I bring to a boil, turn off and mascerste over night or at least for a few hours before drinking….deicious! tastes way better than any coffee I remember…..Perfect timing I was just discussing liver function with a friend yesterday.Don’t forget the stalks are equally nutritious. I like to slice the stalks in such a way that I create broccoli “coins.”Mike: Good point. I’ve made those “coins” you are talking about in the past. I enjoyed them.Here’s another tip for people: I’ve recently started enjoying ‘broccoli slaw’. It is a packaged food – where manufacturers are slicing broccoli stems into super-thin sticks and adding some carrots. For someone who is not a fan of chopping, eating the broccoli slaw is a great way to get some broccoli.I read years ago that the broccoli stalks are higher in alkaloids somewhat toxic to the liver. These alkaloids are produced as deterrents to insects crawling towards the nutritious tips. Perhaps it needs more research.R Ian Flett: I appreciate the info, but what a bummer! I’m going to research this some. If true, it will make it harder for me to get my broccoli on. (sigh) Thanks for taking the time to write this.the alkaloids are the protective part, and this is the whole plant… thankfully our stomachs are nice and acidic to help us break it downCould this not indicate that the elevation in the enzymes is due to the body reacting to a sort of toxic ingestion?Is there a difference between raw and cooked broccoli? Its often served raw on salads, but some authors suggest its dangerous to eat raw, while others claim its necessary to eat it raw to obtain its most important beneficial effects.Raw broccoli can both be beneficial, while cooking deactivates certain compounds such as sulforaphane, it enhances others. There is not toxicity seen with eating raw broccoli unless consuming over 100 cups per day which is not feasible on a normal diet.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-detox/I always tell my carnivorous friends they can be “virtual-vegans” if they merely have a big salad & a big side of broccoli with their steak-&-potatoes dinner; but I thought of it as tricking them into noticing how good the broccoli is.

Why is that Gertrude?Agave Nectar is mostly fructose. Fructose is converted to uric acid, fat, and other stuff you don’t want.“Agave nectar consists primarily of fructose and glucose. One source gives 92% fructose and 8% glucose; another gives 56% fructose and 20% glucose. These differences probably reflect variation from one vendor of agave nectar to another.[6][7]The impact of agave nectar on blood sugar (as measured by its glycemic index and glycemic load) are comparable to fructose,[8][9] which has a much lower glycemic index and glycemic load than table sugar (sucrose).[10][11] However, consumption of large amounts of fructose can be deleterious and can trigger fructose malabsorption, metabolic syndrome,[12] hypertriglyceridemia, decreased glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and accelerated uric acid formation.[13][14][15]” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agave_nectarSo shouled I continue to drink apple juice that I juice my self ?I have the same question. I don’t know if you are talking about apple juice from the grocery store or organic apple juices I juiced myself?My suggestion would be to eat the entire edible part of the apple rather than just its juice.How about an apple smoothie? Then you get the juice and the apple but in the liquid form. Nothing like a blender-made breakfast fruit smoothie!The link to Apple Skin: Peeling Back Cancer is no longer available Doc. I’d like to also know if juicing apples along with other fruits and veggies is still an ok route to get our kids to consume.The Apple Skin: Peeling Back Cancer is not available because it is tomorrows video so stay tuned!Are we talking about home made juice or processed apple juice found in groceries? (does it make any difference?)Got the answer, we’re not talking about home-extracted organic apple juice…Cloudy Apple Juice Preparation. The cloudy apple juice was produced from the 2006 apple harvest. Before being processed, apples were stored for 9 months in a commercial storage room under controlled atmospheric conditions containing 2% O2 and 2% CO2 at a temperature of 1.5uC. Fruits were washed and disintegrated using Frymaperforated disc mill Ascorbic acid solution was dosed (200 mg/kg of apples) into the mill funnel during grinding. The resulting mash was directly pressed on a hydraulic pack press . Raw juice was centrifuged using continuous flow disk stack centrifuge at 1500 rpm and citric acid (3 g/L of product) was added. Hot (96–98uC), cloudy apple juice was placed in 0.25-L screw-cap glass bottles using plate heat exchanger. After 30 minutes, the bottles were cooled in tap water and then stored in the dark at 4uC for 4 weeks until use.The difference is crucial when you are talking about nutrition. The store bought apple juice is processed (fibers including other nutritional items are removed) than cooked (pasteurized). Cooking destroys all the enzymes and degrades the vitamins (destroying some). Blending whole apples or fruits gives you 100% of the vitamins, minerals, and micro-nutrients for good health.There is a key difference between juicing and blending. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fruit-juice-fail/Is apple cider any better?Yes, I think all of us juicers need to know ! Most Green juices I make , I also throw in an apple. Is this bad now?? What is good for you anymore?? Seems like so many studies come out daily about things that you thought where good , now being bad. I am confused.If you don’t have Gout and you are healthy you are OK to have a few juices, but the healthiest way to live is consuming a Whole Food plant based diet. Whole food is the key phrase because when you grind up food you are now processing it. This processing of apples takes the sugar out of the plants cell and causes spikes of glucose that are hard on the body. If you chew it however you will not get as high of a spike in blood glucose (protecting your body) and still get the benefits of the Whole apple.So, what about juicing veggies. Is it good for you ?????Also, when I make veggie juice I make about 32 oz.s and one apple is added to that. So, that isnt much is it. I just like the way it taste with appleIt’s easy to get confused. Now here’s an article saying too many anti-oxidants (super foods like blue berries and broccoli) may allow more cancer: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2259280/Superfoods-make-cancer-MORE-likely-says-pioneer-DNA-study.htmlThe author of the text confuses antioxidants in wholefoods and pills as well as research on those.Juicing should always be a treat, like any sweet water. The whole food is always best. That is not news. Our bodies love all that wonderful fiber. It’s how our insides function to help take that good sweet stuff through our intestines to our cells. Eat your greens….or make a smoothie to utilize the fiber. There are a lot of nay sayers about smoothies, but better to get it all in you. Just keep it simple and vegan. Lots of water and voila….Health.you could switch to green smoothies: all the nutrition and the fiber. i personally cant physically eat very much (digestive issues) so green smoothies are the next best things, its a whole food, just kind of “pre chewed” lolThat was a bitter-sweet study! Maybe you could have ended that vid with, “How about them Apples!” ;-)is this fresh apple juice or heavily processed made from reconstituted apples juice????I’m also interested in whether or not juicing apples is a good or bad thing.I sometimes used to get back pain, slower heart rate, and exhaustion from drinking store bought apple juice. Sometimes got the same with grapes though. Always passed within 30 minutes or so, then I felt great.It’s easy to get confused. Now here’s an article saying too many anti-oxidants (super foods like blue berries and broccoli) may allow more cancer: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2259280/Superfoods-make-cancer-MORE-likely-says-pioneer-DNA-study.htmlDr Greger, would you recommend to drink any store-bought juice at all? For example 100% grape or orange juices seem not that bad, or do they act as sugary drinks in our bodies? Thank you.I would avoid fruit juice in general although under some circumstances such as a diabetic having a low sugar incident they can be very useful.The healthiest beverage is tea see… http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-beverage/. Certainly the way to go if you are traveling on a plane see… http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-airplane-beverage-2/ although if I’m traveling late in the day I bring my own caffeine free tea bags (I like chocolate peppermint) as airlines don’t have caffeine free tea bags. Although based on the healthiest tea maybe I should go with red or wild berry zinger see…. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/.this is very disappointing info about apple juice … what about real apple, that freshly juiced and consumed in 1-2 minutes???Would not make much difference except mainly in taste as I imagine the fructose levels would be the same. The problem with juicing is it throws out the fiber(good for you) and the peel(where the phytonutrients are located). Whole food is best but blending is better than juicing.Fresh juices and prossesed juices are very different, fresh juices are more nutritional in general, and apples in general are high in fructose, juiced ore not. Should one refrain from eating apples? Whole apples contain fiber, that gives you a feeling of fullness, that’s why you couldn’t probably eat 10 apples, but you can easily drink them. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12403253)Great message. So glad I have always loved the whole fruit and while other mothers were peeling their little darling’s apples, mine was giving us whole apples. A wonderful treat! Thanks Mom!For a popular and helpful lecture on sugar metabolism, see the UC Berkely YouTube channel (UCTV: “Sugar the Bitter Truth,” Dr. Robert H. Lustig). According to Dr. Lustig, sugar reduces to two harmful components: lipids and uric acid. Once I eliminated sugar and animal fats from my diet–favoring a whole foods, plant-based diet–my gout attacks are now infrequent and minor. Also, uric acid stores in our body fat, so weight loss releases uric acid in quantities too rich for the blood and kidneys, which triggers a gout attack. This accounts for my current episodes since I don’t eat animal protein or eat refined fructose. The KEY to sugar metabolism from whole foods is FIBER (along with nutrition). The whole fruit and vegetable incorporate within them the vehicles for eliminating uric acid through the intestines. Thirty percent of uric acid is eliminated through the intestines–if possible–while the other 70% is eliminated through the kidneys–if possible. By the way, gout reveals itself as arthritis in the extremities. Imagine kidney stones in the joints.I think it is important to be specific when using the term sugar. Glucose, Fructose, Table Sugar(one molecule of Glucose and Fructose). Dr. Lustig is very clear that fructose is the sugar metabolized to uric acid, inflammatory aldehydes and fats. In addition to uric acid the consumption of animal protein contributes to the formation of kidney stones. Congratulations about improving your diet and avoiding gouty attacks. Whole foods containing fructose, glucose and sucrose such as fruits are the same as the conventional chemicals but the other ingredients make their absorption and handling different. Good luck in eliminating the remainder of your attacks. Hopefully as the science keeps coming in we will better understand significant clinical situations such as gout.What about certain studies such as this > http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0056339. They claim that vegan diets have higher serum uric acid concentrations, the science seems sound, I’ve been over the study a few times.Not enough calcium!woopWhat do you think about Water Kefir? Most folks make it homemade, like myself. It use unrefined Sucanat or whole sugar in water with the ‘grains’ which are 43 strains beneficial cultures. In two days you have a probiotic packed drink. Some times I make by mason jar mixture with a can of Coconut Milk (canned) added to the 2 day concoction. The bacteria usually eats almost all the sugar. What do you think of this compared to other sugar drinks? The sugars are whole (just crushed drained sugar cane that has been dried) it has all the vitamins and minerals of the cane. Actually, it would be neat if you could do a piece on Water Kefir and its benefits. There is also a culture called Milk Kefir but it has added milk, uckkk, with its added de-benefits. Thank youI’ve also been curious what the science has to say about water kefir. I’m also very interested in hearing about any evidence that compares kefir to rejuvalac. I make rejuvalac for nut cheeses. But someone told me the other day that she thought that water kefir tasted better than rejuvalac and that she was able to drink it straight compared to rejuvalac (which other people also drink straight).I was wondering how the various bacteria would compare. Of course, I presume that would depend a lot on what bacteria happen to be in the air and on ones grains – at least for rejuvalac.Who knows, maybe Dr. Greger will find some studies to report to us in the future.I hope he does. Rejuvalac is fermented like all the others. While Rejuvalac and sour krout type ferments are from open are bacteria, they are, in that way, different from the age old 40-60 strain bacteria cultures that has been passed down from generations to generations that are used to prepare Kim chi, Kefir, and Kombacha. They have tried to locate the first original ‘mother’ Kefir grains (they are all very similar even from around the world) and believe they are back as far as Egypt in the Biblical days. ALL Fermented foods are chucked full of Vit B and Vit K2. Excellent additions to any diet which ever one you choose to eat. I have friends who LOVE Rejuvalac cheese, and I can tell you homemade Coconut milk water kevir is so good that it is addictive :)","['antioxidants', 'apple juice', 'apples', 'blood sugar', 'blueberries', 'cancer', 'fructose', 'fruit', 'fruit juice', 'gout', 'high fructose corn syrup', 'juice', 'lettuce', 'meat', 'phenolics', 'phytonutrients', 'Poland', 'polyphenols', 'pork', 'sugar', 'sweeteners', 'uric acid', 'vitamin C']",Why the spike in antioxidant levels in our bloodstream after drinking apple juice might not be a good thing.,"This is the third in a video series about sugar.

When you do that I get 1,145 grams of potassium for banana, which is double the potassium of the date on an equal calorie basis. And molasses gets 1,464 grams of potassium. And Wholesome organic molasses blows regular molasses out of the water, too. For a tablespoon of Grandma’s molasses the label says 110 grams of potassium. Wholesome says 720 grams of potassium. I’m using either product labels or CronOMeter for my data.From what I remember there are two kinds of strokes, ischemic and hemorrhagic. Does potassium help prevent both kinds?Potassium was specifically linked to reduced risk of ischemic strokes, those caused by a blockage in an artery feeding the brain. They account for about 80 percent of strokes.The mineral was not, however, linked to a lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke, which occurs when there is bleeding in the brain. Larsson, et. al., Dietary Potassium Intake and RIsk of Stroke. Stroke. 2011;42:2746-2750.I’ve found that you have no video on psoriasis yet. Is there anything out there on the nutritional treatment of scalp psoriasis? I have found a coal tar shampoo to be at least mildly effective. But I am concerned about its carcinogenic properties!?I would be concerned with the use of coal tar shampoo as well. I would try the many other over the counter and prescription options without coal tar before settling on coal tar to control your condition. See my post at http://nutritionfacts.org/video/potassium-and-autoimmune-disease/ in response to psoriasis question raised by Nurzat. Nutrition can play a role in improving or resolving psoriasis. Good luck.That’s funny, because I was doing the Eat to Live diet, avoiding salt altogether, and eating all fruits and veggies and ended up being hospitalizes for low sodium and high potassium, taking 3 bas of saline solution to cure. Now I eat some salt and follow your diet and I had the best fasting labs ever! Love your incites. Judith McConnellwhat is your current diet judith after Eat to Live?do you still eat mostly fruit,veg,beans?One cup of banana has less potassium than one cup of tomato paste… what a shocker! Who eats a whole cup of tomato paste really?Indeed, a failed attempt at mythbusting I’d say. The table says 150g banana (I guess one big banana) have about half the potassium of one cup of beans, beet greens or 178g dates. Which is a lot. I don’t know about everyone else, but I’d eat 2 bananas over the other stuff any time of the day. It only takes a few minutes and is a great snack, too…The hands down potassium boost is sun dried tomatoes. I do eat these as a sort of vegan jerky when hiking. 3427mg per 100gm. And they don’t get smooshed and black in my backpack. :)Parsley is another green vegetable that is absolutely loaded with potassium. Parsley has 1080 mg in just two little sprigs. I put way more than two little sprigs of parsley in spaghetti sauce, which I use in a tortilla lasagne, or tomato based, Spanish Gazpacho soup, Vegetables are generally lower in fructose than bananas, although, I also love bananas, just have to restrain myself.All plants have potassium.especially wasabi root and amaranth leaves. Unfortunately, these are more difficult to find.Where are you getting this information about parsley? The USDA nutrient database lists fresh parsely as 55mg for 10 sprigs – leaving just 11mg for 2. Well below bananas.Chiquita, which use to be known as the United Fruit Company, did in fact have a PR company. They hired Edward Bernays, the founder of modern public relations. United Fruit Company did a lot a reprehensible things in its glory days of the 50s and 60s. Although this isn’t the site to get into all that…On another note, most likely they did in fact try to sell more bananas by convincing the general public they were high in potassium. I would imagine that all kinds of misinformation about nutrition actually started in the minds of PR guys.On Facebook you linked this study: http://1.usa.gov/U6G5eP And there is a line that says “Low-fat diet was not found to have a protective effect.”I am a huge fan of yours, been following you for a while, and respect you and your work more than anyone else out there. I consider you a type of Bodhisattva of nutrition :) Would you please tell me your stance when it comes to consuming oils?I know Dr. Esselstyn and Dr. McDougall are almost ideologically against oil and their reasoning makes a lot of sense “oils are extremely low in terms of nutritive value. They contain no fiber, no minerals and are 100% fat calories”. But I question it in my specific circumstance. In the case of people accustomed to consuming the average American diet and living the average American lifestyle, the practical wisdom of “NO OIL!” is very valuable. But I am 32 years old, I have virtually no body fat (I’m 5’10” weighing 128 pounds) I am VERY physically active in sport competition martial arts, with the exception of occasional oil consumption, I eat almost entirely whole foods and am entirely a plant based vegan (wide variety of vegetables, whole grains, legumes, mushrooms and so forth). I personally feel I need more calorie dense foods for my body type and lifestyle and using first cold pressed, unfiltered olive oil seems to help. What is your opinion?Dr. McDougall gives example of two athletes who lived on potatoes for six months and due to needing more calories, oil was added to their diet. It was considered of no nutrient value except to add calories and thus didn’t mess up the experiment. Sounds like you’re another who can add oil!My potassium is 5.8, my Dr. says this is high and to cut down to 1 banana instead of 5/day. I am vegan & eat a lot of fruit & veg. Do you consider 5.8 high?It depends on the laboratory normals where the tests are run. Remember that some folks run a bit high or a bit low normally… about 1 in 20 are outside “normal values” even though it is normal for them. The interpretation needs to be viewed in conjunction with other values. It is possible that this in a normal value for you or the lab might have made an error. When blood is drawn into the syringe the red blood cells are sometimes broken up liberating potassium which causes a “false” positive. Previous values help sort this our but if you do cut to one banana and the value goes down you might increase to 3 and repeat the test. The number of banana’s may not be a critical issue. Good luck.You write often about strokes and stroke prevention. But while most strokes are ischemic (blood clots), a significant percentage are hemorrhagic (bleeding). Since the two kind of strokes work in opposite ways (blood too thick v. blood too thin), don’t different nutritional safeguards apply?I wish those researchers wouldn’t shop up the vein diseases. Just like they treat all the cancers as completely different diseases.In a properly managed vegan diet, is potassium chloride (salt substitute) used as seasoning a useful way to increase potassium intake?Yeah when I look at the USDA list that Dr. G is using, I’m not seeing anything that says bananas are low in potassium. The problem is that when you search the USDA database by nutrient, it sorts everything by the cup, or something similar. So like a comment has already observed, who’s going to eat a whole cup of tomato paste every day? Who’s going to eat an entire cup of spirulina? No, according to the database, a medium-sized banana (118g) has more potassium than a cup of cooked quinoa.Is salt substitute a good source of potassium?“Postmenopausal women should eat more potassium-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, beans, milk and unprocessed meats in order to lower their risk of stroke and death,” said Sylvia Wassertheil-Smoller, professor emerita with the department of epidemiology & population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.I get that the dairy and meat special-interest groups spend millions to manipulate humans into devouring such Russian Roulette foods to ensure the longevity of their multibillion dollar industry while shortening all lifespans. But I’m more shocked and angry that most supposedly life-saving doctors also commit this same murderous practice of promoting known killers such as meat and dairy for the same psychopathic reasons of profit without the slightest hint of remorse for encouraging millions to die every year. It should be a crime for doctors to recommend meat and dairy.","['bananas', 'beans', 'beet greens', 'black beans', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cardiovascular health', 'citrus', 'dates', 'dietary guidelines', 'fruit', 'greens', 'heart disease', 'heart health', 'industry influence', 'orange juice', 'oranges', 'potassium', 'stroke', 'tomatoes', 'USDA', 'vegetables']",Increasing the intake of potassium-rich foods is associated with a significantly lower stroke risk.,"Very few people are eating enough plants—see yesterday’s NutritionFacts.org video-of-the-day 98% of American Diets Potassium Deficient.

Addiction to sweetness is a much underrated modern condition that has been severely exploited by the food industry. It does not really matter in this respect what the type of sweetener it is; the exaggerated digestive signal is sufficiently problematic.There are genetic differences involved. My genes show that I’m a super taster of sweet with a childhood aversion to bitterness. It’s interesting that the genetic aversion to bitterness wears off over time and actually becomes a preference in mid life. However, my sweetness preference under the influence of exploitative food technology became a teenage addiction that took decades to get under control and particularly at the expense of my dental health.The fact that sugar is antibacterial and used as a preservative for product shelf life is an additional factor. Excess sugar as empty calories and artificial sweeteners with zero calories, both do enormous damage, not to mention the ubiquitous high fructose corn syrup. They badly distort our evolutionary instincts, yet we continue to reward our children with ‘sweeties’. It’s a cultural disaster.Is this an argument to stop chewing gum? I chew a lot of gum because it prevents me from snacking, but maybe I’m actually doing my body a disservice and consuming more calories overall because of the artificial sweetness of the gum.Just sharing from a friends experience: He did the same thing to help curb his food cravings, it seemed to build on itself. The more sugar free gum he had the hungrier he felt so the more gum he chewed. When he finally stopped with the gum and began focusing on eating healthy instead of simply reducing calories he started loosing weight, which was his goal and has been maintaining his progress for about 9 months now.I am addicted to sugar., and between that, menopause, osteoporosis and dental disease I’m doomed.

I can’t wait to know the downsidesFenugreek is also easy to sprout. It’s too hard and crunchy otherwise. How else would you prepare it?I just use powdered fenugreek.How much do you use, etc.Dear dr what about mycotoxins in ground seeds, can you help us in better understanding the existence of mycotoxins in spices of herbs?I think there might be an error in the video. It says that fenugreek allowed athletes to leg-press an extra 100 pounds vs placebo. The results in the background seem to point to an extra 50 pounds vs placebo and 100 pounds vs before training., you can soak it over night in cold and mineral water, its taste greatI read that Fenugreek is also effective in lowering Trglycerides which is a type of Cholesterol, according to Sloan- Kettering.POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT! Actually it’s usually touted as an upside: fenugreek as a galactagogue, to increase breastmilk production… but if you don’t need it: oversupply. Ouch. This vegan family avoids it in food, never mind the supplements.how if it is used by youngsters in grind power form with water in morning, thn also will it side affect breast? should in discountinue using it? plz replyDo you know of any studies on successful toenail fungus treatments? Also, which vegan foods tend to cause sinus congestion, mucus, etc.? What causes red scaly skin on the cheeks and what can be done about it?ThanksHopefully your toenail fungus has improved since your post but if it hasn’t, apple cider vinegar works great. My wife had a case of fungus since she was a child and it was pretty bad. After soaking her feet for 20 minutes every day in diluted apple cider vinegar, her feet were 100% fungus free in about 1 year. It was the first time in her life that she felt comfortable wearing sandals. Her case was pretty severe so if it is minor you may see results in a shorter time frame.Applying Vick’s Vapor Rub (or generic) to your toenails and covering them with a sock, kills fungus quickly.So how much Fenugreek should we eat to get the benefits mentioned in weight lifting?The study used a standardized extract:500 mg of Fenugreek (Torabolic ™ Trigonella Foenum-Graecum) (standardized for 70% Trigimannose)The term “Trigimannose” appears nowhere else in the literature, but from the name its obviously one of the mannose polysaccarides found in Trigonella. If Trigimannose is the tetramannose this patent claims muscle building benefits from, then the 350 mg Trigimannose in each capsule would be equivalent to consuming 10.93 grams, or 1 Tbsp, of whole fenugreek seed (assuming there’s no other elements in the whole seed that interfere with digestion or the anabolic effect).Darryl, could you provide the source you used determine that 350mg of the compound is equivalent to 10.9 g, or 1 Tbsp of whole fenugreek seed?FYI I also found a mistake in the above.. It’s 2 capsule of Torobolic = 350 not 1 capsule as you say above.According to the label of Torobolic (the supplement used in the study), the recommended dose is 2 capsules/daily. The total dose (both capsules together) contain a total of 350mg of 70% Trigaminose (the active ingredient aka extract). Hence both capsules together contain 350mg trigaminose, so one capsule contains 175mg.http://www.amazon.com/MET-Rx-Torabolic-quik-creat-60-count/dp/B00AUDW9UG/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1392585165&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=torabolicFYI I also found a mistake in the above info. It’s actually 2 capsules of Torabolic = 350 Trigimannose not 1 capsule as said in the above post.Darryl, could you please provide the source you used determine that 350mg of Trigimannose is equivalent to 10.9 g, or 1 Tbsp of whole fenugreek seed? I’m interested in finding a different source of fenugreek than Torabolic but getting the same dose as used in the study. (The reason I don’t want to use Torobolic, is that it contains the artificial coloring titanium dioxide). http://nutritionfacts.org/video/titanium-dioxide-inflammatory-bowel-disease/According to the label of Torobolic (the supplement used in the study Dr. Greger does on Fenugreek), the recommended dose is 2 capsules/daily. The total dose (both capsules together) contain a total of 350mg of 70% Trigimannose (the active ingredient aka extract). Hence if two capsules contain 350mg trigaminose, then one capsule contains 175mg.http://www.amazon.com/MET-Rx-T…It’s been a while, but the trigimannose concentration in whole fenugreek is part of the the linked patent.

I noticed today that my arm pits didn’t smell bad even after a sweaty workout (I had forgotten to put on deodorant too!) I like that side effect. Also like the cancer fighting part!Thanks, TumeriaAfter viewing this video, I began drinking fenugreek tea daily (1 tablespoon organic fenugreek seeds in water) and eating the seeds at the end of the day. I’ve experienced benefits not even mentioned in the video, but in further research found the following on the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center’s Integrative Medicine website:Contraindications: Fenugreek acts as an estrogenic receptor modulator and was shown to stimulate breast cancer cells in vitro (26). Patients with hormonal-sensitive cancers should avoid this product. How does this contraindication measure up with the data on fenugreek’s effect on prostate cancer cells? I don’t want to discontinue my fenugreek consumption, but I also don’t want to encourage breast cancer. Thanks so much for all your tremendous work in promoting plant-based diets and nutritional research!hey, you mention benefits not mentioned in the video – not mentioned by you either! come on, spill the beans…..Not sure if i’m on the up and up with this video. As one person stated “This work was funded by Indus Biotech” – bottom of page 8. Indus Biotech are the makers of the supplement Torabolic used in this study. Should be mentioned for full disclosure” I did a google search on Indus Biotech Torabolic, below will be the first link in the search. I was excited to watch this video, seeing as i’m all but vegan now and prefer it that way and i also go to the gym 5 days a week, i’ve noticed i’ve lost a little strength and some size, so any way to gain some of what i lost back i would be interested in, but not after what i found in the google search. I can’t take something, let alone believe in it, that MET-Rx is pushing, ie Torabolic. I’d call myself one of your biggest fans Dr. but i’m not agreeing with you on this oneHow about sprouting fenugreek? Does it have the same benefits?Not to try to cause any disinformation here but: Been taking fenugreek for 2 weeks since this video came out… I’m most always 204 lbs when working out… weighed myself 5 weeks ago – 204 lbs… weighed myself 2 days ago 210.5 then i looked up some side effects and apparently it is used as a appetite enhancer… and people use it to gain weight… may help the skin vegans but I’m naturally muscley and get fat easily. so I have to be careful with stuff like this… in those 2 weeks didn;t notice any strength improvement at the gym.Okay, then you didn’t need dietary encouragements.Which form of consumption is more optimal; whole seeds? or grounded to powder?Where do you find this in powder form?I buy a package of the whole seeds and then grind them up in a coffee grinder. The same way I do with flax seeds. You could grind up a whole weeks worth and store in the freezer or refrigerator. Then use as needed during the week.I’ve also heard it can be used as a natural breast enhancement, seems possible as it contributes to the production of milk, but how true is this information? Thank you for your responseIf increasing strength, lowering fasting blood glucose, HDL, and VLDL, and inhibiting cancer weren’t enough, perhaps this will capture your attention:Steels, Elizabeth, Amanda Rao, and Luis Vitetta. “Physiological aspects of male libido enhanced by standardized Trigonella foenum graecum (fenugreek) extract and mineral formulation.” Phytotherapy Research 25.9 (2011): 1294-1300.Where in the study are you getting an extra hundred pounds on the Leg Press? On the table from the video the gains in leg press strength for fenugreek and placebo are:Fenugreek: (419 – 334) = 85 lbs (25% increase) Placebo: (364 – 316) = 48 lbs (15% increase)That looks to me like Fenugreek gave an extra 37 lbs on the Leg Press which is within the margin of error. Am I missing something?I didn’t analyze the data, but wouldn’t be surprised to find dubious claims. The study was about a proprietary extract, and funded by the producing company: Indus Biotech.Up to now, as far as I know, these results have not been replicated.You go, Greg!You are correct. And let’s not forget that the specific supplement used in this study and funding this study, Torobolic, contained a known ergogenic supplement. This trashy study didn’t control for CREATINE, hence Dr. Greger should delete it. It is worse than anything Atkins ever marketed.marketing at it finest?Does fenugreek help you lose weight by drinking it as a hot tea?Will you please address these two contradicting studies? One concludes that Fenugreek promotes breast cancer cells and the other concludes that it kills breast cancer cells. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22471470 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20571172The next time you make a vegetable stir fry, sprinkle in some fenugreek powder as it cooks.

First off, as others posted below, this study was funded by makers of a specific supplement. second, and more important by far, is the fact that the supplement has CREATINE in it. CREATINE is a proven strength enhancer. To give placebo vs CREATINE is not a very reliable study model. How’d you let this one slip by, Dr. Greger?!

However, i do not eat grocery/production meats. All meats in the grocery stores are from factory farms. i raise my own chickens, eggs, ducks, geese, cows, goats, all on pasture and no antibiotics or GMOs. They are all free pasture ranged. I am 58 and very healthy and i eat some meat every day (my home grown stuff). So i think that healthy diet has more to do with how our food is produced/grown/fed, than actually WHAT we are eating. I also eat all my own garden veggies & fruits (no pest/herbicides) and if i purchase, then i try to only purchase organically grown.RJ: I applaud you for trying to eat healthy. I also encourage you to watch more videos on this site so that you can improve your healthy eating. There are some things that are inherent in a food itself that no amount of production process changes. If you are interested, you can find all sorts of scientific information this site that explains the details.Good luck!RJ, I agree with you and your approach to food. The studies that Dr. Gregor discusses regarding factory farmed animals are really interesting but can not be applied to pasture/organic raised animals.Organically fed and raised are not allowed to be fattened up with antibiotics, and I don’t believe have ever had antibiotic resistant super bugs, which are caused in part by Glyphosate and the animal husbandry promoted by Big Brother to profit their bottom line. Although, the Obama Administration seems to be bending the Letter of the Law when it comes to organics, allowing more synthetic ingredients on the National List, which in turn allows Monsanto to manufacture “organic” pest controls using organic chemistry. Organic chemistry has NEVER been part of the National Organic Foods and Production Act of 1990. I only buy from farmers or sellers I know and trust.The Center for Food Safety has repeatedly litigated against the USDA’s bending of the National Organic Foods and Production Law and has generally won. And the Cornucopia Institute is a watch dog for Organically grown food and animals. Check out their web sites to learn of victories, or defeats.As a member of both entities, I urge you to join us with money and activism to save our food supply and fight back Big Bullies.The roof of my mouth either becomes numb or burns depending what is in the pesticides used on organic foods. This prompts me to write the company, if I have the address, or, not to buy from them again.It is either the Cornucopia Institute or the Center for Food Safety that has said that non-organic and non-sustainable farmers choose to ignore the urging of the government to feed their livestock the ground leaves and stalks from cotton, sugar beets, sugar cane and other crops, which are full of pesticides. This supersizes the toxins the animals eat. (No wonder my dogs kept dying at younger and younger ages every year since 1982.)All the major pesticide companies have supersized the amounts of pesticides on produce, as well as 100 ppm for fast growing Teff forage and hay. See: § 180.364 Glyphosate; tolerances in the right hand column of the Federal Register, and read the Conclusions at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-05-01/pdf/2013-10316.pdfFortunately not all farmers or ranchers use chemical agriculture on their pastures. Those that do was about 7%. Remember, the tolerance level is based on the Acute Effect and Glyphosate is a CHRONICALLY TOXIC HERBICIDE, it is not ACUTELY TOXIC. Hence, the tolerance residue levels don’t protect the health of the livestock as much as the health of the corporations bottom line.Organic farmers do NOT use chemical pesticides and only use biological controls sparingly. Organic farmers are the ones who pushed for a federal law! The problem is Greedy Opportunistic Predators who are also bullies driving farmers and ranchers out of business so we will have zero choice of what we eat or feed our animals.This is also the reason for the massive wolf slaughters, even of the nursing pups. It is so that the Greedy Opportunistic Predators in Congress can murder wildlife instead of eating factory farmed livestock. When Obama wined and dined contributors, he had his appointees roundup the wild buffalo (bison), separate the calves from their mothers, and head the adults for slaughter. This way the President could serve non-GMO meat to his benefactors. Disgusting!!!Should we give feedback on the new site here? Or is there a better place for it?I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that the new site does not auto-start the videos every time you do something on the page. That’s a huge relief.On the downer side: One thing I already miss from the old site is the feature that shows the next 4 videos – including wrapping around. So, previously, it was very easy for me to go to the latest video-of-the-day, and see the next 4 videos on the right of the screen. Since it was the latest video of the day, the next 4 videos were actually the first 4 videos from Volume 1.Aside from just liking the feature of being able to scan 4 videos ahead at any point, being able to quickly find the first videos from Volume 1 was really important. Two of those videos are extremely hard to find via the Search feature, and yet I want to show those videos to people often and want to give people a way to get the “first one” and thus follow the whole set of videos in order if they want.Maybe I’ve missed it, but if you don’t already have such a feature, maybe you do this: Have links to videos by volume. For example, links like: Volume 1 Volume 2 Volume 3 …. Volume 11 where the links take people to the first video of the volume. That would be great.Then, the wrap-around feature would not matter so much, but I would still like to be able to scan ahead and see much more than just 1 “next video” for videos in the middle of the series.Just something to think about.ThanksI wondered if this is true with organically raised chicken or turkey? With Thanksgiving in less than 2 weeks I will buy organic and spend the extra $$ if it is healthier.Pesticides and contaminants aside, poultry is not the least bit healthy to eat. This food still contains inherent compounds such as endotoxins (http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/endotoxemia/), high levels of arachidonic acid (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-eggs-and-inflammation/) (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/) as well as other inherent substances (http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/)Interestingly, another study showed that in eating fish, darker meat consumption was associated with higher rates of heart attack.

Thanks.You bet.  If you are really interested in some interesting science based info check out Jeffery Smiths book Genetic Roulette.  Be forewarned, it gets depressing reading the info and really makes you start to feel helpless because you start to see that the FDA has given control of all GE (Genetically Engineered) foods to the companies who make them.Here’s another great website: http://www.gmwatch.org/Check this evaluation of the FDA on GE foods by William Freese with the Center for Food Safety:“Contrary to popular opinion, the FDA does not regulate GE foods.  Instead, the FDA has a ‘voluntary consultation’ process that allows biotechnology companies to make all of the important decisions related to bringing their novel GE crops to market.  The company, not the FDA, decides which, if any, safety tests to conduct and how they will be performed.  The company, not the FDA, determines which data, if any, are shared with regulators.  In fact, the company even determines whether it will consult with the FDA at all. Because the process is voluntary, biotech companies sometimes refuse to supply additional data requsted by the FDA. And at the end of the consultation, the FDA does NOT approve the GE food as safe, or even as similar enough to its conventional counterpart to exempt it from scrutiny.  Instead, the pertinent bioteck company makes these determinations on its own authority.” http://www.biosafety-info.net/file_dir/2183848844f3c1e862.pdfThis is just one of thousands of articles that state that the FDA has disregulated the GE food industry.Sad but true.Thanks.

While glass is breakable, when intact, it is totally inert.I’m not liking the sounds of this. I eat a lot of canned beans (kidney, chickpea). I always cook lentils, but maybe I should start buying only dried beans. Mike: I hear you.  I eat a lot of canned beans too. One thing to keep in mind is: if you are willing to pay a price, there are brands of canned beans that are BPA free.  Dr. Greger did a blog post about the Eden brand which not only (if memory serves) is BPA-free, but is also cooked in some seaweed, so you get some (the right amount) iodine with your beans, assuming you include the liquid.Eden is quite spendy compared to other organic canned beans.  But it might be worth it…  And maybe there are other brands which are also BPA free?Good luck.Thanks Thea. I may look for the Eden brand, but I really should master the art of cooking dried beans.I have a tip for you:  Look into pressure cooking.  That’s something I did after deciding that I needed to start getting comfortable cooking dried beans.  (It’s kind of scary and time consuming…) The pressure cooker has turned out to be awesome!  I find that I still tend to reach first for a can when it comes to beans, but when I want to cook whole grains, including something as simple as brown rice, the pressure cooker is my darling.  That said, I *have* cooked beans some in the pressure cooker, and I can’t imagine wanting to cook beans any other way.  The pressure cooker is both a time and energy saver.I have three cookbooks on pressure cooking.  The one I think is best is: Great Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure by Lorna Sass.  This book has a great section on beans, including big, convenient charts on bean cooking inside the front cover for quick reference.  The title says “vegetarian”, but the book is really vegan as near as I can tell.  I’ve enjoyed almost all of the recipes that I have made from this book and some are favorites.My second favorite book is: The New Fast Food.  The Veggie Queen Pressure Cooks Whole Food Meals In Less than 30 minutes.  The book I didn’t like very much was the Everything Vegetarian Pressure Cooker.Good luck!Thanks Thea. I like the title of the one by Lorna Sass. I have to do something once I run out of my stores of canned beans (lol).“pressure cooking.”Exactly. :)I rinse the dry beans, picking out any bad or cracked beans. Soak 8 hours or overnight in fresh carbon filtered water (to avoid 2,4-D and other pesticides that may be in my tap water). Next, pour off the soaking water, and add fresh carbon filtered water. They can be cooked 8 hours in a crock pot (the different beans have different cooking times) OR cooked by boiling, then reducing flame to simmer for a couple hours covered. Soaking reduces the cooking time as well as the flatulence causing properties of the beans.Amazon has Eden Black Eyed Peas for $23.96 for a pack of 12 cans and that includes free shipping (2 day shipping if your a prime member). You can also buy them directly from Eden @$2.06 a can or $3.32 for the 29 ounce cans and shipping is $10-$13 depending on the size of your order. I agree that it costs a bit more for eden’s products and for me the pros outweigh the cons. Amazon only has a few of Eden’s legumes available that include free shipping. I went to several grocery stores by my home and I couldn’t find any retailers that had a wide selection of Eden’s products. I’ll probably be placing a large order on Eden’s website to save on shipping as I really like their products as well.Cory: It is nice of you to share your research with us. I really do appreciate it. But to give everyone some price comparison, I have a very easy time finding organic canned beans right in the store for $1/can. That makes Eden about twice as much with your best prices. At my store, the prices for Eden beans are more like $3-4.I can very much understand why you say that the Eden brand is worth it. But for some people, price is a big factor. And if we can help people to just eat beans, even from a non-Eden brand, those people would be better off than on the SAD diet. That’s why I don’t push people to Eden or other BPA-free brands. Just something to think about.FYI: I’ve lately been cooking lots and lots of dried bean hearty stew dishes in my pressure cooker and having marvelous success. Great winter food and a way to avoid the cans altogether.Good luck to you. If I decide to get some Eden cans, I’m going to use your advice and look on Amazon. Thanks!I buy dried beans whenever and wherever available from Eden Foods. But, they are becoming more and more rare. I google, Eden Organic, and the name of the bean, and canned beans generally come up.Have you tried VITA-COST for canned Eden Organic beans?I have a couple cans of Eden Organic beans the are BPA free. But I’ve long been concerned what BPA FREE may contain. So, I stockpile dry, which last about a year, and I always buy certified organic to avoid Roundup and other mineral chelators that may be used before, during and after when growing beans or wheat, or other gmo foods. Beans are are gmo in Europe, and may be in the USA as well.Google, certified organic, bean name, and “dry” beans, and you may find someone who carries what you want.Also, to learn more about mineral chelators, they are cited in a talk by both Don Huber, Ph.D. soil and plant pathologist, microbiologist, retired professor at Purdue University, speaking on GMOs in an interview with Dr. Joseph Mercola.Get the transcript. Google: Don Huber, GMO.There is also an article in the 18th April 2014 issue of the Ecologist by Dr. Thierry Vrain, Ph,D,, entitled “GMOs and RoundUp – junking down our food supply” which explains the same things that of which Dr. Huber speaks, and why he tells his students to only buy organic.Frederick von Saal was the University of Missouri scientist who uncovered BPA –epoxy of bisphenol A in the formulation of a “new” petri dish that caused the breast cancer cell to multiple profusely. He is cited in a Prevention magazine article. http://www.prevention.com/health/healthy-living/bpa-free-plastic-safeDr G, good stuff!

But if you read the article (Scheter et al.) the authors found a very low level (much lower than canned) in only sample of the meat tested.From the methods section:“Food samples consisted of three samples for each of 31 kinds of canned and plastic wrapped food for human consumption, four kinds of fresh meat and fish (one sample each), and eight individual samples of canned and plastic wrapped pet food.”From the results and discussion section:“One fresh food sample, sliced turkey, had a BPA level of 0.35 ng/g ww, which is lower than reported BPA levels in fresh food from Italy”Since the authors only tested one piece of turkey, we cannot conclude that this is generally applicable finding.Good post.I’m trying to gauge whether eating canned beans and beets once or twice a week could make a significant impact on my health. Maybe I should get off my lazy butt and figure out how to slow cook dehydrated beans more effectively, and buy fresh beets when available.Anyone have any tips for slow cooking dehydrated beans? Mine always come out poorly.Thanks for the info Dr Greger and friends. You make a difference in improving my health.I pressure cook dried beans all the time and they always turn out lovely. If I don’t have time to soak them I just rinse them well, put them in the pressure cooker, add filtered water till it covers the beans by about 2 inches, and cook for 45 minutes for most beans. Do not add salt until they are finished cooking.What about BPA leaching in cans of Coca Cola?Coca Cola is already toxic, but can be made more toxic because of the aluminum and if BPA is part of the mix.The second citation link is broken.

I understand that there are other examples too. You pay a price for it, but it may be worth it…?Is it possible that bisphenol-A (BPA) leach out from paper cups into food and drinks? I heard about that paper cups coated with polymer to make effect of waterproof, and I wonder if polymer lining will release BPA when it holding hot coffee. If it is a fact, it means when we drink coffee also swallow BPA at same time.It’s not just BPA! Beware “BPS” too!!Industry is using BPS as a BPA substitute. Unfortunately, it comes loaded with similar harmful effects. What coating (if any?) is Eden Foods using in place of BPA? For more on BPS and where it is found: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130122191412.htmEden’s canned beans don’t contain BPA but their canned tomatoes still do (or to be more accurate, their canned tomatoes still did when I inquired a few months ago).Here’s a list of canned salmons with and without BPA. http://eatandbeatcancer.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/salmon-says-an-anti-cancer-investigation-what-kind-is-healthiest-part-6-canned-salmon/I now buy Eden Organic pressed tomatoes in glass jars. They come very carefully wrapped to my front door via Fed-X. Glass, while breakable, is far more inert than canned/tinned with or without BPA.Susan: I appreciated this tip and held onto it for a while. And then I noticed in my local health food store that they were carrying the Eden tomatoes in glass. I might not have really noticed if I hadn’t read your post–since I was focused on looking for something else. Thanks for your tip!You are very welcome, Thea. I went to Eden Foods web site to find spaghetti sauce in glass jars because those delivered to a local healthier food store had been opened by a rude customer –she even put her dirty fingers in and tasted the organic tomato sauce, which is totally against the health laws. After several times bringing home contaminated sauce, I decided to order directly from Eden Foods. And it was there I discovered that they have other foods in glass containers. They taste soooo much better in glass. This took me back to the 60’s, when most everything was in glass. Their crushed tomatoes in class are absolutely delicious and they are not available in the local health food stores in my area. We have more than one, and the closer store has more enlightened and caring customers.Susan: That’s seriously shocking behavior. I’m very glad you were able to find an alternative. I personally think that store doesn’t deserve your business.Eden CANNED beans are BPA-free, but that does not mean they are non-toxic. All products, especially acidic foods canned or jarred in plastic are dangerous. The scientist that first discovered breast cancer cells multiplying at a faster rate in his new petri dishes, discovered that the manufacturer changed the formulation without telling the customers. Intense study has found that all plastics are toxic and BPA substitutes may be more toxic than BPA. But don’t go back to BPA. Go to the web site for Eden Foods, and look at the glass jarred crushed tomatoes with onion and garlic, and they also have some other foods as well. Of course, Eden Foods has more canned foods with BPA substitutes because they’ve been on the market longer and ship better. But, I started buying their small glass containers of tomatoes, so they started marketing the larger jars, and I bought those too, by the case. And, now I don’t have to worry about rude, uncaring customers opening them and inserting their dirty fingers inside to taste the product and see if organic tastes different. Then closing the jar and putting it back onto the shelf. I had complained to the store manager, but nothing is being done because some customers are so rude and fanatical about tasting the organic, that the manager fears for her employees safety. So the store has a policy that if the bottle is contaminated, just bring it back. That’s fine, but it’s an inconvenience to me when I’ve planned a recipe only to find that there’s a lot of fuzzy mold inside the container. Hence, I go directly to Eden Foods and buy organic in glass!Susan, Several companies who use glass instead of cans have told me that there’s still some BPA in the lining of the top but that it doesn’t touch the food. Do you know anything about that? I think I won’t worry about it, just won’t lick the tops.Thanks for enlightening us. I can’t believe that people actually do that.You are correct. There is BPA in the lining of the tops. It was put there because of the potential of the toxic metal, lead, being in the can or top lining.If the can or bottle ALWAYS stays upright, there may be no problem. BUT if it ever lies down on its side, there is a problem. That is the same problem as with juice in glass containers, which my husband always shakes and gets the bacteria, any fungus, as well as the BPA in the juice.Since he refuses to listen to me, I buy whole foods and eat them instead of juice.Read: Is BPA-Free Safe in Prevention magazine online at:http://www.prevention.com/health/healthy-living/bpa-free-plastic-safeAnd can you tell us more about that scientist you mention? Any links to his work? I’d love to read more.Frederick Von Saal is a cancer researcher at the University of Missouri. There are several pages in the book, “Our Stolen Future –a scientific mystery story,” published in 1996 by Dutton that was written about his work. The book is co-authored by zoologists, Theo Colborn, Ph.D., John Peterson Myers, Ph.D., and Diane Duminowski. The book is available at Amazon.com for an amazing price, especially if you have anything else to buy from Amazon at the same time to get free shipping. http://tinyurl.com/okhm94aThe home page for Our Stolen Future (not the book, but the location of newer studies) is at: http://www.ourstolenfuture.org/I had the pleasure of hearing Drs. Colborn and Myers speak at a Scientific Assembly in Bethesda, Maryland in 1992, prior to the writing of this book. At the time, she spoke of another book that was totally scientific, and I as a layperson found reading it was incredibly difficult. She mentioned that she was coming out with the above mentioned book that is written for lay people in a few years. Our Stolen Future still needs some background knowledge, as I didn’t know anything about the endocrine system of what the various glands did or how they communicated. That meant many hours in the public library getting myself up to speed.When I heard them speak, I took my tape recorders and set it on the front row desk to get everything loud and clear. It was more information that my poor brain could remember otherwise (as I had been poisoned with an insecticidal fogger several years previously). But, I listened to the tape over and over again until I could almost recite it word for word. That made understanding this much better.There is another interview by the three at Dr. Mercola’s web site.

I’ll cherish a few cashews, and stay with my beans and greens! BPCveg:  Doug’s recipe looks good.  I’ve made similar recipes in the past and liked them to varying degrees.Unfortunately, the one I referred to above was something that I just made up on the spot without keeping track of ingredients or amounts.  I definitely could not recreate it.  I know I threw some cashews and water to barely cover in a professional-style blender.  Then I put in nutritional yeast and a bit of smoked salt and  lemon juice.  I’m pretty sure I added some other ingredients until I liked the taste, but darn if I remember now what they were.Since you ask about cheese, I have to mention that I *just* discovered the book Vegan Artisan Cheese by Miyoko Schinner.  I ordered it from Amazon.  The reviewers rave about the book and the recipes being incredibly true to the “real” thing.  I have a feeling that after trying those recipes that I will be redefining the what counts as “the real thing”.What I can say about the various vegan “cheese” sauces that I have made so far: They may be yummy, and they can definitely take the place of a traditional cheese or cheese sauce, BUT they are really, clearly NOT cheese in taste or texture.  Miyoko is reported to have solved both problems.  I’m very excited about trying it.Good luck with your cheese sauce adventure.  (And thank you Doug for sharing your recipe.)Thanks Thea! Like you, I aspire to be a gourmet vegan chef…hopefully the Miyoko book will live up to the promise.Care to share how you made teh ginger curry quinoa.Thanks in advance for any tips.I will. Give me some time to get it together. Thanks for asking!Wow.  I never would have thought of this.  Very interesting.Fascinating! I tell my readers to eat wild meat, but now I need to warn them about lead from bullets. I guess hunters should consider switching to bow and arrows.…or simply use copper bullets.  Several other non-lead options as well.Wow…I think people totally miss the point of Dr. Greger’s work.  No bullets are necessary if you get it!I always strangle a bear for dinner…Or they could use their bare hands. Wouldn’t that level the playing field?Or, better still, save the lives of wildlife and let the hunters hunt with cameras!so true. as well, there’s been a decades-old  epidemic of ‘mad cow’ in wild critters :   http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/wild-game/MY01079 With game there are a few health-related precautions to keep in mind: Chronic wasting disease (CWD). Similar to mad cow disease, CWD is found in deer and elk. While human infection is a potential concern, there have been no verified cases. To minimize risk, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that hunters who harvest deer or elk from known CWD-positive areas consider having the animal tested for CWD before consuming the meat…http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/savvy-scientist/the-slow-march-of-chronic-wasting-disease/563 …From an infectious disease standpoint, CWD is far more frightening than BSE. In BSE, the infectious prions are normally confined to tissues of the nervous system. People get exposed to BSE prions in mad cow beef only because slaughterhouse conditions often splatter brain matter indiscriminately, and it only takes a milligram or so of infected tissue to transmit the prions.In CWD, however, the bad prions manifest throughout an infected animal’s tissues and secretions: they show up in its saliva, its blood, its bones, its feces, its urine, and its muscles…Interesting! All the more reason to show why I went plant-based. Why worry about a disease that turns your brain into swiss-cheese. Just turn to the plants and not only save each other, but the animals and the Planet. ;-}Right on, HemoDynamic! Wild game also carry campylobacter, pathogenic E. coli, salmonella, etc.  All the data available on pubmed.  Example:Assessment of Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli Isolates from Wildlife Meat as Potential Pathogens for Humanshttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2765146/Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus among Wild Birds in Mongoliahttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3439473/If you’ve ever had to deal with hunters, you’ve probably noticed that their reasoning abilities have seemed… impaired. Now we know that there might be at least a partial answer- besides the fact that their parents are usually close relatives.I heard deer antler tips is healthy as a supplement, can you summarize the research findings on this? thanks!Deer Antler tips is used in Chinese Medicine to “rejuvenate and strengthen” the body. However, this is based on the belief that if one takes in specific animal tissues that one will take on the characteristics of that animal (i.e., strength). There is absolutely no scientific evidence that deer antlier tips provide any nutritional value or have special “powers” to strengthen or rejuvinate. The best way to rejuvenate and strengthen the body is by consuming a whole food plant-based diet filled with phytonutrients that have been shown by science to rejuvenate the body.I am very familiar with consuming animals killed by bullets, what we do is cut away the parts that are ‘shell shocked’ or discolored and bloodied by high velocity impact. If it looks at all suspicious it is cut away and left for the magpies on the mountain side usually, sometimes at home as it is being cut up if not detected in the field…Interesting. Thanks for sharing!","['animal protein', 'heavy metals', 'lead', 'meat', 'venison', 'wild game']","Standard rifle bullets disperse tiny lead fragments throughout the flesh of wild game, raising public health concerns about lead poisoning in those that consume venison, based on a study of white-tailed deer shot by hunters.","The new data I refer to in the beginning is a reference to yesterday's video-of-the-day Modern Meat Not Ahead of the Game.

See IGF-1 as One-Stop Cancer Shop and Cancer-Proofing Mutation. The binding protein findings may explain the conclusion in Is It the Diet, the Exercise, or Both?. As I covered in my full-length 2012 presentation Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death, tomorrow’s video-of-the-day How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1? will go a level deeper and explore why eating plants lowers IGF-1.If you haven’t yet, you can subscribe to my videos for free by clicking here.Life is the pursuit of balance not happiness; for, finding balance brings happiness.So where is the balance of IGF-1?  For finding this would bring reduced rates of cancer and increasing happiness for so many.As for now I think this will remain a rhetorical question. What about vegan children?  If IGF-1 is so important for growth, are vegan children at risk of slow growth?  Are vegan children statistically shorter, lower in weight, or underdeveloped?Amazing! I know–gives me goosebumps!Just like quitting eating meat Cold Turkey!  Gave me Goose-Bumps ;-}I did it cold turkey too! It was my New Year’s resolution for 1994. Had Popeye’s fried chicken on New Year’s Eve, turned lacto-ovo on New Year’s Day, then lacto (no milk, but cheese), then vegan in 2000. I’ve had accidents, but have never cheated.Meat free since midnight ’93!  ;)I think this might have been addressed by the fact that longer term veg eaters blood appeared to have the same effect on cell death, but I’m curious if there isn’t a possibility that after several weeks the lower IGF-1 levels achieve a new steady state and another mechanism might impact cancer cell growth.  Would the same increase be seen in lower term studies if IGF-1 was added back at that point?Another one for the good guys.Dear Dr. Greger, THANK YOU for all your efforts in improving health throughout the world! :) After your video yesterday, I became intrigued (as usual) and searched for information about IGF-1 and became a bit confused. First, I watched a BBC documentary in which the presenter, on the advice of a couple of researchers and physicians, went on a 4-day fast and then occasionally fasted for a couple of days at a time. This seemed to be enough to significantly lower his IGF-1 levels with no apparent change in his Western-based diet otherwise. He lost a bit of weight. So do you think the drop in IGF-1 levels while on a healthy entirely vegetable-based diet has to do with the vegetables themselves or do you think it could have more to do with a lower calorie intake or drop to a normal weight? Second, in a video on YouTube, Dr. McDougall accused soy protein of being even worse than milk and animal protein in boosting IGF-1 levels. However, in the same video, he also says that the amount of IGF-1 in vegan men and women is much lower, even though they eat lots of soy. We’re a vegan family that consumes lots of soy products, so if IGF-1 levels are the key to good health, should we also be aiming for lesser calories and less soy, at least in the adults? matchalover: Great questions.I am not an expert and can not answer all of your questions.  However, I thought you might be interested to know that the Portland VegFest conference this last weekend featured speaker, Mark Messina, PhD.  “Dr. Messina has devoted his time primarily to the study of the health effects of soy foods and soybean isoflavones.”After looking at all the science around soy, his bottom line was that people *should* be eating soy foods.  There were some limitations.  For example, Dr. Messina did point out the same case study that Dr. Greger points out where a man drinking huge amounts (12 cups?) of soy milk every day ran into problems.  But he felt that all the research points to an over all health benefit from a certain number of servings of traditional soy foods (like tofu and tempeh) each day.I only caught the last part of the speech.  So, I don’t know if he addressed IFG-1 specfically, but I did catch his bottom line and I do know that he *did* address cancer.That said, I do know that Dr. Greger has videos coming up with titles such as:   “Too much soy may neutralize benefits” and “How much soy is too much?”  So stay tuned.  Based on all of the videos from Dr. Greger and based on the talk by Dr. Messina, it is my guess that like many things (such as protein, vitamin A, etc.), there is an optimal range for soy food intake.  You don’t want too little or too much. I will also add that I found this quote about Dr. Messina: “He is a former program director with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), where he initiated a research program on the anticancer effects of soy.” Apparently, eating less food includes eating less of the bad food that increases IGF-1 in our bodies. I don’t think it’s a matter of a vegan vs. an omnivore diet, but a matter of the specific nutrients in a food, vegan or animal. Seems to me that we’re better off eating most plant foods since this is what nature suggests. Our ancestors weren’t fast enough to run down animals, didn’t have claws and fangs, so they naturally ate plants. But when their ideal foods were in short supply or they were less in tune to their instincts, they became scavengers and ate whatever was available. It’s possible however that not all plant foods were part of our original diet or are healthy for us- especially processed, concentrated soy, as Dr. McDougall gives evidence for in  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHYFOJBU434 so it’s probably best to avoid it as a staple. Legumes, along with grains and some other plant foods have anti-nutrients and poisons in them, although some of them can be removed by cooking. But not all of them. And I don’t know whether the first humans cooked or not. So it’s possible that not all of grains or legumes are totally healthy even after this processing or part of our native diet. All I can conclude is that just because it comes from a plant, that doesn’t mean that we should eat it. I would guess that most traditional vegetables and fruits are safe though- although I wonder about the nightshade family of vegetables for example, are safe at least some people who seem to be sensitive. And there is evidence that cultures have thrived on white rice for example, the bran containing some toxins.Dr. Luigi Fontana has studied calorie restrictors and found that they had higher IGF-1 levels than raw food vegans.  Looking more closely, it was found that the CR guys were eating 25% protein, while RFV were eating 10-12% protein.  When the CR guys lowered their protein intakes to 10%, their IGF-1 came down.  PMID: 18843793Even elevated levels of vegetable protein (ie soy isolates) can lead to increased IGF-1.  PMID: 7571965 .  I would venture to guess that brown rice protein, Hemp protein and split pea  protein would elevate IGF-1 if consumed in excess.    This is something that bodybuilders (even the vegan ones) have known for some time..  Hi,I also watched that BBC documenatry, and I would love to know the answer to that as well. The documentary is: BBC Horizon 2012: Eat, Fast and Live Longer. I too saw the Horizon show on fasting and IGF-1.  I am really curious to know  how fasting might fit into an overall healthy vegetarian/vegan diet, as “matchalover” asked.Hoping you’ll get into the details of which foods are high in IGF-1. For instance, dairy for sure, but what about soy protein isolate, as Dr. McDougall discussed in one of his videos online. Soy protein isolate qualifies as “plant-based” and yet it seemed to elevate IGF-1 levels even more than dairy, according to McDougall. Here’s the study Dr. Mcdougall cites:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12629084Soy has natural estrogen soy eating soy with breast cancer will increase the cancer…..its a fact cuz when I took care of cancer patients they gave me their soy if they had any…plus my dad died of breast cancer and he couldnt eat any tofu, not that he was a big fan….and my mom has breast cancer but she is big on organics and veggies…and my sister had it twice…actually the obituary said he died of breast cancer…which did spread to his liver….but he died from the hospital…he got pneumonia and twice they put his leg blow up cuffs…..i dont know what you call them…way to tight and he couldnt walk….the second time he never could walk again….they day he was due to leave…he died….the veggie diet gave him two years….after he was on hospice….and off hospice and driving and painting and dancing.The fear over soy, and the reasons for it, are unjustified. Soy does not have natural estrogen. Please do more research. QUOTE….Int J Endocrinology .2010 Sep 22. ..low-intensity aerobic training decreased the circulating levels of IGF-I by 9%, while IGFBP-1 levels increased by 16%. An interesting finding was that higher pre-training level of IGF-I was associated with greater decline in IGF-I with training. Insulin-sensitizing low-intensity aerobic exercise is thus considered to be an effective method for downregulating IGF-I and upregulating IGFBP-1 levels: And the very latest,  from Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2012 Sep 25. Concludes:Older men with higher IGFBP1 level, or both lower IGF-I and testosterone, are more likely to be frail, while those with lower IGF-I and higher IGFBP1 are more likely to become frail. Components of the IGF-I system may be biomarkers or independent predictors of frailty.So if we eat more plants and do more walking, we reduce our cancer risk and die of frailty instead.Longevity is clearly not just a case of endlessly reducing/increasing some serum-level  components such as IGF-1, testosterone, vitamin D, selenium, zinc, or anything else, but finding what the optimum levels are and what baseline we are starting from (e.g., the appalling Western processed diet). What makes it so maddeningly complex is that these optimal levels are interactive, and that’s before genetics and epigenetics are factored in.IGF-1 protects the skeleton, but at what level does it become a negative and in what context? Also IGF-1 repairs muscle tissue in bodybuilding’s high resistance exercise, but it seems to do this locally. Does this have adverse effects elsewhere or are the local effects confined? So much more research needs to be done as paradoxes abound.so is low intensity exercise (walking) better than higher intensity exercise(running) for cancer prevention?is 30 minutes better than 60 minutes daily?A very tough question. Recent studies in the UK show that major CVD benefits for most genetic types could be achieved through only ONE minute of intense cycling (to exhaustion) three days a week, but there is no indication of what this does for cancer. Interval training loses weight faster than steady walking, but it probably increases IGF-1 levels. Intense exercise triggers repair mechanisms, but at what cancer cost? If you look at centenarians, most were active in the sense of lots of walking, or time on their feet, but were not athletes, bodybuilders, or heavy exercise junkies.The assumed trade-off between reproductive energy expenditure and longevity, if true, may have a part to play here. Building larger muscles such as heart muscles via heavy exercise may also increase the (growth) hormone components of cancers. I wish I knew. Distance runners are notoriously skinny while sprinters are well-muscled. The distance runners probably have too little IGF-1 and are frail, while the sprinters probably have a healthier level and maintain their muscle mass. Sarcopenia (loss of muscle) with age is one of the things we need to be concerned about as we get older, so I’ve started doing uphill sprints and taking branched chain amino acids, which the research seems to support as effective measures against it. So, you see, R Ian Flett, you don’t have to die of either frailty or cancer. Check out High Intensity Interval Training and BCAA articles on the internet.Vegans have as much free testosterone as meat-eaters, so that would not be an issue. Exercise and a bit of weight-lifting should take care of any fraility issues. Still a good idea to have higher levels of IGFBP1:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22357965I was eating a plant based diet when I was diagnosed with breast cancer.I wouldn’t rule out exposure to plastics/toxic chemicals as a cause then. Technically, I think you should have lower risk on a strictly plant-based diet but frequently our foods are wrapped/shipped in plastics that have estrogen-like chemicals. Also, do you eat/drink things off a plastic or heat them up in the microwave, etc. ? Just a thought to consider. Hope you get well soon!The three studies involved low fat, high fiber, not just plants.  (Actually, looks like Barnard allowed a little meat.)  Low fat was defined as 15% or less.  If you’re going to talk about a “healthy plant-based diet” as shown in particular studies, you should specify the diet in question.The McCarthy article makes specific points about low fat vegan diets, not only vegan diets in general.Pritikin himself specified 10% fat.I’ve been watching your videos from the first one on.  Lots of great stuff.  But I haven’t heard you specify your notion of a healthy fat level or if you think that one exists.If you don’t, then I don’t think it fair to rely on Pritikin, Ornish, Esselstyn, Barnard, and others whose diets do limit fat.…But didn’t Pritikin DIE of Cancer while eating an impeccable plant-based diet?not sure how accurate this information is but “In the early 1980s, he began to suffer severe pain and complications related to his decades-long fight with leukemia, which had been in remission for 27 years.[4][5] He committed suicide on February 21, 1985.[6]” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_PritikinDr. Grerer, Didn’t Pritikin GET cancer, and was dying from it? Haven’t studies comparing vegetarians vs. non-vegetarians always concluded pretty much same all cause mortality? Only significant protection I’ve noticed is from ischemic heart disease. The vegetarians died of cancer.. just like the meat eaters, and had higher probability of getting certain cancers? Why doesnt this match up with what you are saying or Furhman or Mcdoughall? Am I restricting what I eat unnecessarily? Pointlessly?Liz: While you can find studies to show anything you want, the way to get your answers is to look at the body of scientific evidence. That body of evidence is pretty clear, with studies favoring plant based diets FAR outweighing studies saying anything else.Concerning your specific questions: “Haven’t studies comparing vegetarians vs. non-vegetarians always concluded pretty much same all cause mortality” No. I’ve seen studies where vegetarians and vegans live longer. The latest study I saw put vegetarians at 7 years longer life. Based on what we know about nutritional science, I would expect whole-food vegans with b12 supplement to live even longer – precisely because we get less cancer, heart disease, etc.“The vegetarians died of cancer.. just like the meat eaters, and had higher probability of getting certain cancers?” No. Not just like. One thing to remember is that there can be a huge difference between vegetarian and vegan. Vegetarians can end up getting as much animal protein as meat-eaters. Dr. Greger recommends eliminating animal products, not just meat. So, it probably isn’t hard to find studies that show small effects on vegetarians. However, vegans have been shown to have signficantly less cancer, especially breast, prostate, colorectal and I believe others. I highly recommend that you read The China Study if you want to educate yourself on the link between diet and cancer. You might also watch Dr. Greger’s video Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death – available on this site.re: “The vegetarians died of cancer…” One thing I like to remind people is that lowering probability of something happening is not the same thing as guaranteeing that it won’t happen. If I find out that I lower my risk of getting cancer by say (I’m just throwing out a number to make a point) 50%, I consider that a significant reduction and worth my effort. Put another way: If two people in your family would get cancer by doing nothing, but one person could be saved by doing something, wouldn’t it be worth it to do something?So, what is the actual probability/lessening of risk? That depends on types of cancers, environmental factors, which studies you look at, etc. But one think is almost always clear: The lessening of risk is significant. So, to answer your question: “Am I restricting what I eat unnecessarily?” That’s for you to answer. But if you want the best chance of avoiding the most common diseases afflicting Americans and other Western cultures, then the answer is very clear: NO. You are doing exactly what you need to do to help yourself.Best of luck to you.Researchers studying people over 100 years old around the world reported that all of them ate meat, none ate yoghurt, and none exercised for their health. They had nothing else in common, including their diets.Pritikin DID NOT die of cancer. In 1985, he took his own life. But..his diet gave him 27 years extra life compared to the time he was told he had. Back in the 50’s he had a “decades-long fight with leukemia, which had been in remission for 27 years.[4][5] (thanks to his diet) He committed suicide on February 21, 1985.[6]Vegan propaganda at its best. There are plenty of other possible reasons for early puberty. We have been eating meat and other sources of animal protein for thousands of years. Just now these proteins are causing early puberty? This is a disgrace. I can’t believe people buy into this utter crap because they are sooooo biased by their belief thst we should not kill animals for food. This is very sad. Please, please, come up with better reasons to eliminate all animal products from our diet! The China Study and Forks Over Knives have both been debunked by some very intelligent people who did very solid research. You can’t use these weak arguments anymore.Morgan, just because you think this way doesn’t mean anything, have you got actual scientific data to support your loathing of a nutritional diet? Your statement sounds like you’re the hefty wife of a beef farmer sitting around a table knitting with your friends, no data, just unsupported greasy hate statementsFYI, for the “thousands of years” we haven’t been injecting our meats and diary with hormones. If you don’t believe “vegan propaganda” then it is YOUR loss. I feel for your family that will have to mourn your early departure from this Earth. Your choice entirely. No one is out there taking away the steak you are eating against your will!Try it. You obviously never have.Just for prevision, the published research does not say that the diet was vegetarian; indeed the “diet consisted of natural whole grains, fruits and vegetables with limited amounts (< 3.5 oz) of fish, fowl or lean meat and nonfat milk"".This is friggin incredible!Chris, I am familiar with your story from watching Quest for the Cures, a fantastic and illuminating series, and kudos to you for being so brave and for sharing your experience with so many! (Gotta love the internet or we probably wouldn’t know about any of it!) Anyway, I am also very interested in the huge issue of the diverse dietary approaches, and wish someone could reply to your query! I know this is an older post, but the question still begs some feedback. I’m aware no one has all the answers, but it would be great to at least hear some thoughts on the matter! Anyone?No where in this video does it let anyone know that Pritikin committed suicide after suffering severe pain and complication due to his having leukemia.http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20090134,00.htmlhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Pritikinhttp://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2013/09/waste-time-finding-perfect-diet.htmlOf course chemo is never the answer to a cancer diagnosis, anyway, the way I see it.I don’t understand how his ultimate demise is relevant to the work and example he set. The autopsy of his body found a remarkably healthy (for the Western world) vascular system. And as any suicide, no one other than the subject can fully know his/her circumstances that led to that final breaking point. We can only guess and imagine. Our conjectures mean nothing.An associate of mine recently attempted such. I’ll never know exactly, and won’t ask, it changes nothing between us.

Palmful of seeds or nuts? Any thoughts? Thanks!I see no purpose in this but if you wish to go for it!If he’s running, he can handle some fructose.Ha! Why am I assuming veganrunner is a he!Valnaples, From Dr. Greger’s video on eating dried fruit, nuts, or fruit and nuts together (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-fruit-nut-bars-cause-weight-gain/), it seems you could eat dried fruit and/or nuts–as long as you’re not adding sugar–and it would have no effect on your weight. Hope that helps!This is news to me. In the bodybuilding world, or mostly athletic world, we’re told to eat smaller meals several times a day — usually the number is six. I assume the study in the video pertains to regular, non-active people?I have found professionally inaccurate information is pass on from gym rat to gym rat. I worked in many of gyms before finishing my studies. I am not really sure where they get their info.I am an “active” person and 6 meals a day? Nope, unless you count a handful of nuts a meal.It appears it doesn’t make a difference.Veganrunner, mind if i ask what your daily meals specifically consist of?  Im newly vegan and need help designing a vegan diet that supports athleticism and muscle gain.  Seeing what u do successfully would really help!Hi Stacy, Sure. Well I just got back from running 8.3 miles. Before my run I drank a smoothy of spinach, blueberries, mango, strawberries, hemp seeds, flax seeds, chia seeds, alma, green tea, hibiscus, cashews ginger and enough water to make the blades spin and so I can pour it. About 20 oz. I find the smoothy sits best before a run. I alternate that with steal cut oatmeal and many of the above things plus cinnamon. I just need more time before my run if I eat oatmeal. For lunch I usually have a very large green salad with lemon and a smidge of olive oil. Or maybe some leftovers from the night before. Or maybe rice cake with tomato and avocado. For dinner I generally have various vegetables, quinoa etc. Large salad etc. I made the best miso soup with mushrooms, seaweed and tofu the other night. We are huge beans and rice fans with fresh salsa and corn tortillas. For snacks I might grab a handfull of walnuts or almonds. I also like to keep sautéed tempeh in the fridge so if I feel like I need a bit more protein I cut a slice off and eat that. I hope that was helpful. I have teenage kids so I am always looking for recipes that they won’t complain too much about! :-) And I find most recipes can be adjusted to be vegan. Muscle gain? Are you a body builder? Keep in mind “specificity of training.” I do really well running with my diet. You may need to tweak it a bit if you aren’t getting the results you want. I would probably add more nuts. (I believe that has been Dr. Furhman’s recommendation to his athletes.) Thanks so much!  Look really healthy!How many cals are u able to get?  What about macronutrients (grams and %)?Are u gluten-free?Do u think that soy is healthy?  If so, how much is good to have per day?And what about protein powders?  Which are the best?Opinion on nutritional yeast?Lastly, do u believe in food combining principles?Thanks!!!!I don’t really pay attention to calories or % but I would say I eat a lot. But a lot of vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds and grains. I try to get as much of a variation as possible. Yes I am gluten-free. I eat very little tofu (soy) and I don’t drink soy-milk. Tofu one time per month? I don’t really like it that much and it doesn’t sit well with me. It is a processed food so verdict is out on whether it is healthy or not?  But sometimes there are good recipes with tofu so I try them. Like a vegan tofu mayonnaise for example. I don’t use protein powders because I eat such a variety of foods that I am sure I am getting the required amount. However there is a pea protein powder that looks interesting. Just peas and I think 23 grams of protein per serving. I do some things with nutritional yeast. Unique flavor so more savory dishes I think. I like it. Reminds me of cheese. I have read a lot about combining food principles and I actually really enjoy Dr. Gillian McKeith but I haven’t read any great research about it so no. How about you? Okay. Wow. And you take b12, of course.And you get enough protein? I guess if you aren’t lifting, you can do less.Hi dm, yes I take B12. We get more than enough protein in our diets. If your goal is to lift weights to increase muscle mass you just need to lift weights. My morning smoothy has about 25 grams of protein and that is without any kind of protein powder. I weigh 120 so eating 60 grams would be on the high side. I occasionally add pure pea protein powder but I really don’t need to.It would be interesting for the good doctor to do a similar segment on the benefits (or lack thereof) of perodic fasting.He has acknowledged fasting in a few of his videos actually. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-benefits-of-caloric-restriction-without-the-actual-restricting/Good to know. Some people can be so adament in regards to their beliefs on numerous meals throughout the day. They can be so rigid in their regimented eating structure that their days are often set up so that they are in a constant state of drinking water and eating meals throughout the day. I am simply NOT the kind of person that wants to do that all day. I am trying to get my mind off not eating, not worrying about eating on a regimented schedule. The types of foods, not the frequency is my main concern. I really appreciate knowing that their recommendations are not mandatory for my health.I eat 3 bigger meals AND snacks, and my Bmi stays at 19.5. I sometimes eat more, or less, it makes indeed no difference. I do eat healthy food all the time and no junk.Hi Dr. Greger,Thank you for all that you do. We couldn’t do it without you.Is it true that when nuts are roasted at temperatures above 170 degrees Fahrenheit, the monounsaturated fats can breakdown, and free radicals & acrylamide can form?Just wanted to let you know that you are appreciated.Thankfully,AndyActually, how you eat is important. If you take the same amount of calories and spread it in smaller portions throughout the day, you will lose more weight. This is not a peer-reviewed journal, but in my case and in the case of people I know who follow this, it does work: http://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/diet-strategies-increase-metabolismare there any good studies published in peer reviewed journals about the ‘Fast Five’ system of eating?

They should be taken for couple of weeks ‘after’ onlyI don’t believe PBs render ABs less effective. But ABs kill PBs, which are essential. The suggestion then is to take a PB during a course of ABs but AS FAR AWAY IN TIME AS POSSIBLE from the AB. So if you’re taking an AB at noon and midnight, take a PB at 6pm and 6am.Good morning,So I have been experimenting with buckwheat grouts. I thought, ” what do I do with these?” so first I cooked them as the package suggested. 20 min. They turned out mushy. So then I thought? 20 min is nothing I bet I can just soak overnight. Sure enough, after rincIng the okra like slim they were great. I ate them mixed into my oatmeal with pastacio nuts, pumpkin seeds, and rice milk.And buckwheat is nutrient dense! Veganrunner:  Thanks for the cool idea.  I’m always looking for ways to expand my food repertoire (in a good way).I agree buckwheat is wonderful, but there is a compound in buckwheat grass called fagopyrin which can cause photosensitivity. How you’re prepping them now is totally fine, but if you end up sprouting them, I’d recommend doing it in the dark (so they don’t green), rinsing frequently (fagopyrin is a fluorescent red pigment you can see being washed away in the pinkish rinsewater), keeping the sprouting to under 8 days, and not making them a substantial part of your diet. But your deslimed breakfast sounds yummy!Thanks for the heads up. Got it-don’t sprout.In the US buckwheat groats are sold in 2 ways: with and without hull.  Stores like Whole Foods sell with without hull, and they are light green in color.  The other kind, with hull, can be bought at Eastern European, Persian, etc. stores.  There are good instructions on how to cook it on the package (but I can’t recall if they’re in Russian…).  In Russia where I’m from buckwheat is eaten only with hull.  Bring to boil – with little salt – 1 cup of buckwheat and 2 cups of water.  Turn heat to low and cook uncovered for another 20 min or so until water disappears plus a little longer.  The grain at the bottom of the pan should be sort of dry (not mushy). It might even stick to the pan, and that’s OK, as long as it doesn’t burn.  Turn the heat off, cover and let it sit until it’s cooled down.  Grains should be separate from each other when it’s ready to eat.  It’s fine to be heated in the microwave for 30 sec or so.  I also heat it up in the skillet with small amount of olive oil for a minute or so.  It gets crispy this way.Correction to above –Stores like Whole Foods sell them without hull… Vera:  That’s such cool information.  Thanks for taking the time to share it with everyone.  I have had buckwheat some, but I had not known of cultural variations or that I could get it two different ways.  Neat.Some other things “good” bacteria like :xylitol (sugar alcohol also used in nasal sprays; super toxic to dogs though) okraOk, I’ve just finished your whole store of videos. What an amazing amount of information. It’s already changed my life ;-) Thank you so much! I’m sick right now from reacting to goat milk and gluten so I’m cleaning up my diet completely and dropping meat and fish at the same time. I’ve been vegan and fruitarian before but, although I loved the fruitarian best and felt good on it for a year, I realized it wasn’t working for the diabetes type 1 I have. So I went on the GAPS diet to heal my gut.  What I don’t understand is that the GAPS and the Dr Wahl diet and even Paleo, all have so many adherents that swear by it. I would think after watching all these videos that all 3 diets would make everyone sick. How can so many people turn around very sick, autistic children with a meat-based diet? It’s very confusing. Diets like Paleo also have you eat a lot of Veggies and Fruits and Zero processed foods.  So you remove a lot chemicals and still get the phyto-nutrients.  So at the end of the day their diet is much cleaner than the average American diet which would score a 12.  Paleo also does not eat conventionally raised meats… only grass fed no hormone or wild meat.  So while they eat meat (too much in my opinion) they have eliminated all the processed stuff and chemicals that are really getting us sicker.Isn’t meat just really hyper processed animal feed? Murder and suicide at the same time.bee.. I haven’t been diagnosed with what you have, but suffer from a myriad of intestinal disorders. Maybe it doesn’t apply, but just wanted to say that I find digestive problems with the high fruit…might just be the bananas for me. Still testing, but I also changed a little to add some of the cooked starches a la McDougall/Bernard etc. I get a lot of gas and diarrhea with those. I do best all raw. I prefer the all produce diet with less fruit than 80-10-10, but can’t really do all one or the other. The best I have been was the 1st year I followed Dan McDonald’s ideas about raw green smoothies, some juicing, and lots of green salads. I use a lot of supergreens as salad greens, not just lettuce, although love me some romaine. Dara Dubinet has some great ideas for all raw and talks a lot about 80-10-10 too. I did lose a lot of weight, which was good for me. I am going to get off the cooked starches again and try again with the mostly raw green smoothies etc. I like them too because I can include some of my favorite herbal ingredients for stress, etc. Also, I feel I need the fiber and juices don’t give me that. Also chewing is a really important part of digestion. Just my 2cents. LynnThe beneficial chemicals manufactured by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria which cause weight loss and prevent cancer include propionate, acetate, butyrate, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and conjugated linolenic acid (CLNA). These beneficial bacteria convert linoleic acid (LA), which tends to cause weight gain and, at least in animals, cancer, into the beneficial conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which does just the opposite: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19228257 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17897219 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16807088 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12492934 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20556602 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18306430Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids also cause weight loss and prevent cancer: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17490962 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17502874 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19356912 http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0105/Bluefin-tuna-auctioned-in-Tokyo-for-record-736-000 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15672113Unlike the “bad” omega-6 fatty acid, linoleic acid, conjugated linoleic acid works well at helping us to live longer by preventing cancer, heart disease, and a dozen other killer diseases. CLA softgels, which are made from Non-GMO (high linoleic) safflower oil, work well at building bone strength, muscle strength, and causing weight loss. Make sure that the CLA softgel you buy is at least 80% CLA and not more than 20% unwanted fatty acids that cause weight gain and cancer: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20656466 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22435614 http://jn.nutrition.org/content/130/12/2943/F2.expansionI am confused…lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are fermicutes. I thought we needed more bacteriodetes? It seems most of the probiotics I thought were ‘good’ are fermicutes.I have a question about candida and the relationship between candida, sugar, specifically fructose, and fat. Is it better to reduce the about of fat consumption to eleminate candida overgrowth or is it better to eliminate all sugar including fructose to eleminate candida overgrowth? I have hear a lot about fat being the culprit and not the good healthy fruit sugars when it comes to candida overgrowth. I look forward to hearing from you and your thought on the matter.Xylitol supplies butyrate and propionate to the digestive tract, yet it is (if memory serves) listed as “harmful” in one of your artificial sweetener videos. Am I missing something? I thought you considered both of these substances extremely beneficial.AC: Dr. Greger listed xylitol as harmful because the product is not absorbed properly and causes diarrhea. In other words, while I do not speak for Dr. Greger, I believe he has decided that the bad outweighs the good.When determining the healthfulness of any food, the goal when possible would be to look at the whole food and weight the pros and cons. So, while a food may have some benefits when looked at one way (say, has butyrate), if the pros don’t outweigh the cons (say, diarrhea) , then the food would be listed as harmful. Of course, we don’t always know all the pros and cons and also, pros vs cons can be a matter of personal opinion. The devil is in the details. Dr. Greger gives his opinion. We can decide what we do with it.Another thought: sometimes it is helpful to keep in mind that Dr. Greger’s videos are often focusing on a single issue – say antioxidants or whatever – and the statements in that video need to be understood within that focus. In other words, not all videos are (or can) take every health factor into account.That said, since the amount of xylitol that I personally eat doesn’t seem to cause digestive upset, I’m not concerned about it since I understand what Dr. Greger’s issue with xylitol is.Hope that helps.I do not remember Dr. Greger discussing the benefits of these 2 compounds, but perhaps the risks outweigh the benefits. Xylitol has a dehydrating effect in that is leaches water out of the intestines which can lead to diarrhea.How does xylitol-induced dehydration lead to diarrhea when dehydration in general leads to constipation?The water is being drawn out of the large intestine into the stool.Plenty of butyrates from the right diet regardless of species http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ismej2014179a.htmlThe lethal dose of xylitol is around 22g/kg, which means I have to eat around 500 teaspoons. That’s ten cups of straight xylitol. Xylitol kills some bacteria because they absorb it as they would glucose for energy, but they cannot metabolize xylitol for energy, so they use energy trying to expel it, only to absorb more xylitol and have to use energy to expel it again. At some point they run out of energy and die. Xylitol also metabolizes into propionate and butyrate in the digestive tract, and as far as I know these are extremely beneficial for human health.I have a question on the best probiotics on the market, I live in Quebec City we have many type of probiotics and I heard from one of my friend, that the best is from plants, not from human or milk extract.

None of the functional or traditional practitioners I have seen thus far support plant-based diet and keep telling me the only way I can heal is to eat animal products and saturated fats. I have experienced the benefits of a plant-based diet firsthand and will never go back to my former poor dietary habits as I believe firmly that it was my poor diet that caused the inflammation throughout my body in the first place. Any resources or references would be greatly appreciated, as I just don’t know where to look and am at my wits end. Thank you for your time.HI Natasha. I am not sure what is best? Here is some information I researched about SIBO.Small intestinal bacteria overgrowth (SIBO) may be linked to a lactase deficiency. Celiac disease can make SIBO worse. Some research suggestsmalabsorbed fat may increase SIBO in subjects with tropical sprue (TS), which “is a common cause of malabsorption syndrome among adults in tropical countries including India. TS is diagnosed by specific criteria, which include biochemical tests showing malabsorption of two unrelated substances, abnormal duodenal histology, absence of other causes of malabsorption and persistent response to antibiotics and folate. Pathogenesis of this disease is unknown. Bacterial infection has been proposed to cause this syndrome in view of small bowel bacterial colonization in most patients and overgrowth in a proportion, which responds to antibiotics4. In fact, frequent occurrence of small bowel bacterial colonization, overgrowth and predictable response to treatment with antibiotics might suggest that the name TS or tropical malabsorption is a misnomer. It should rather be considered as a condition associated with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and colonization in the tropics in absence of an anatomical cause.” I included that explanation because of the possible link between TS and SIBO.This study shows how gut bacteria can be manipulated to help gut-related diseases. The study is free. It may be the best one I’ve seen on the topic. Hopefully others can weigh-in. More videos on the related topics: Boosting Good Bacteria in the Colon Without Probiotics and The Leaky Gut Theory of Why Animal Products Cause Inflammation. So to me eating animal protein doesn’t make much sense. What is the theory or research behind that? I am not saying there is none but I am curious. Maybe try it out, see how you feel? No harm in that. I always encourage folks to work with their healthcare team even if they disagree on a few points. If you find the practitioners are not helpful after your trial, consider seeing a dietitian who specialized in plant-based diets.

See Maxing Out on Antioxidants and Kiwifruit and DNA Repair. The “enterocyte trash recovery bins” of which I speak are an analogy I introduced in How Fiber Lowers Cholesterol, the second of a loose five-part series on the cholesterol-lowering effects of nuts and seeds. Yesterday’s video-of-the-day How Phytosterols Lower Cholesterol offered a bit of phytosterol background and tomorrow’s video-of-the-day Optimal Phytosterol Source explains why whole food sources (nuts and seeds) are superior to phytosterol-fortified foods and supplements. Which other foods lower cholesterol levels? See New Cholesterol Fighters. And why should one worry about cholesterol in the first place? See Blocking the First Step of Heart Disease, Cholesterol and Lower Back Pain, Cholesterol and Female Sexual Dysfunction, and Heart Attacks and Cholesterol: Purely a Question of Diet, a few of the five dozen videos I have on the topic. Then, of course, there’s a thousand other topics—enjoy!It looks like Chocolate has the best Beta-Sitosterol (Black part of bar graph) to total sterol content ratio. ;-}   This is what we want because it is the Beta-sitosterols that have been well know to reduce cholesterol levels.  Here is a link to one of them but there literally are over a hundred of these articles. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Woodgate%20D%2C%20Chan%20CH%2C%20Conquer%20JA.%20Cholesterol-lowering%20ability%20of%20a%20phytostanol%20softgel%20supplement%20in%20adults%20with%20mild%20to%20moderate%20hypercholesterolemia.%20Lipids.%202006%3B41%3A127-132 In fact I have used Beta-Sitosterols to not only reduce cholesterol but Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) between 2-5 grams per day. I have had mixed results with the BPH and Beta Sitosterol usage though.But why take a pill when you can eat Vegan?!Especially, Chocolate!!;-}One caveat, however, is the fat you eat is the fat you wear–so if you go overboard of the nuts and seeds you might start to look like one–that unsvelte pear shape.Literally – If you are fat because of eating pork, lard, butter, cheesefat, trans fatty acids, bacon etc – that is what you will find on your belly in the fat cells – yikes….When I eat walnuts and seeds like pumpkin and sunflower, i get serious pain, diarhea and fever.  What is the next best way to go for phytosterols and omega 3?While searching for my favorite plant phytosterol package, Soybeans, which were not included in this nut and seed survey ;-( I found out, sadly, that 100g of Soybeans only contain 50 grams of Phytosterols, lower than the lowest of the low in this study Brazil Nuts.  http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2621/2, but I also came across this fantastic study:“A single daily dose of soybean phytosterols in GROUND BEEF decreases serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in young, mildly hypercholesterolemic men” http://www.ajcn.org/content/76/1/57.shortYou’ve heard of Tofurkey but how about Tofeef. ;-}I came across this article and thought you all would enjoy. I wish we had it available when Sophie became so upset under the video “What Woman Should Eat” regarding the egg (cholesterol) and cigarette comparison. http://soc.li/QQOFcEV Here is the actual abstract.http://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(12)00504-7/abstract  Egg-yolk years – I like that!As a doctor I always ask my patients about alcohol consumption and tobacco – maybe I will start asking about egg-yolk abuse…..I think you should. Let me know how it goes and I will follow suit. :-) Hopefully Sophie did not “unregister” from the site and can benefit from this info. Thanks for sharing!There is lots of evidence showing that egg yolk cholesterol need not be harmful. However given the average appalling Western diet where atherosclerosis has commenced at a young age and lots of animal fats are consumed, then egg yolks add insult to injury. The comparison with cigarettes is invalid except in a trivial total correlation. The causative factors and contexts are quite different. In some cases egg yolks may improve health by adding to low cholesterol or adding much needed choline. Cigarettes never improve health. Sofie was quite right in decrying the incorrect use of total correlations being used to equate cigarettes with cholesterol. There is a total correlation of gasoline consumption with road deaths by country, but gasoline does not cause road accidents. The equation of cholesterol with cigarettes is pure vegan propaganda although I would still avoid them in most cases.R lan Flett did you read the article or abstract? I doubt the journal Artheclerosis has a vegan agenda.   I understand your point, R Ian Flett.  Maybe the message about the harmful effects of eggs was not made very eloquently in the original video or article. Still, for the most part it seems that staying away from egg yolks makes a lot of empirical and nutritional sense.R Lan Flett, there is not “lots” of evidence showing egg yolk being unharmful. In fact, there is only one study showing this, funded by the egg industry. The egg industry has claimed that cholesterol from eggs is not important and is not harmful. The fundamental flaw in the study the egg industry has used to make this claim is that they measured fasting   lipid levels at night and not levels through out the day after egg consumption. “Diet is not all about fasting lipids; it is mainly about the three-quarters of the day that we are in the nonfasting state. Fasting lipids can be thought of as a baseline; they show what the endothelium was exposed to for the last few hours of the night.”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989358/?tool=pubmedThe issue of dietary cholesterol versus endogenous cholesterol (from the liver) has been debated for decades in hundreds of papers. Shellfish were on the nose for years until their cholesterol was found to be relatively harmless – if not beneficial. The jury is still out on dietary cholesterol because it’s all very complicated. Some people cope with lots of dietary cholesterol and others don’t, depending on many other variables. Cholesterol is critically important to the body and some people don’t produce enough – including some on statins. The various cardiology institutions issue regular bulletins on this and their recommendations wax and wane, but currently at least two eggs per week are considered safe by most institutions. I eat none, despite having my arteries checked and being totally clean. Basically, I agree with Dr Greger that most animal products are nutritionally damaged during processing – purely for profit. There is a big difference between being a committed Vegan for ethical reasons and practising VeganISM, versus adopting an animal product free diet for purely scientific, health reasons as I tend to. The committed Vegan often believes it’s their ethical duty to proselytise and so ‘cherry picks’ their science. This happens a lot in this forum. I respect your ethical choice, but can we please keep the science separate. It’s sounding uncomfortably like the tactics used by fundamentalist, anti-evolutionists. Eggs are not ‘evil’, however they may well be unhealthy in their current supermarket form. It’s not your duty to find fault with them at every opportunity. The gross abuse of statistics in this valuable forum, by some, reveals an excessive emotional commitment that distorts the complex science involved.I have already posted this elsewhere, but here it is again. Current levels of omega 3 in eggs are highly inadequate and one must consume around 30 eggs to reach an acceptable level of omega 3 for the day. A male needs around 1.6 grams of omega 3 per day, a female needs around 1.1 grams a day. Omega 3 processes to EPA which is also processed to DHA, which is highly anti inflammatory. Omega 6 processes down to arachadonic acid which is highly inflammatory. The fact that eggs are the top source of arachadonic acid nulls and voids benefits received from the omega 3 in the egg itself.

What do you think?I am astounded that someone who would be intelligent enough to be reading Dr. Greger would be myopic enough to through the baby out with the bath water, and throw scientific research out with it. In Psychology, we call that cognitive dissonance.Very interesting. After the previous video, “How Plant Sterols Lower Cholesterol, I had been wondering whether, as a conscientious vegan (plants, beans/legumes, grains, seeds/nuts, fruits, no processed oils or sugar) I was running a risk of flushing out too much cholesterol. Thanks, SJ M.D., for your response. And now from today’s video, I gather that there is no such thing as having too much cholesterol flushed out of your body? No – flush it out!Probably this is why Tears for Fears made “The seeds of life” :-)Ahead of their time………:-)The table of best food sources is confusing to me.Could you explain the grey/black portions of the individual lines – what do they signify individually. I see where pumpkin seed looks so unlike the other sources. I’ve been eating walnuts like there is no tomorrow but now feel I should switch to sesame seed.@Ellen, perhaps consider rotating these good nuts and seeds instead of only eating walnuts? I usually alternate organic raw pumpkin seeds with walnuts from day to day for a snack or in a salad and perhaps I need to also rotate in sesame seeds (which I adore, I just don’t eat them that regularly but heck, they are easy to throw into a green salad!) The black part of the bars represents the amount of beta-sitosterol plus campesterol plus stigmasterol, the three most common type of plant sterols, and so, often the only ones that are measured and reported. The grey bars represent other rarer forms of sterols which are not commonly reported.This chart is limited to the amount of sterols in mostly nuts and seeds and by the weight of the food, about 3 1/2 ounces- more nuts and seeds than is healthy to eat in one day.I’d be more interested in the amount of phytosterols we can get on a per calorie basis. In that case, lettuce, capers and sour pickles would be the top choices, followed by sesame seeds with asperagus, beet greens and unpeeled cucumbers not far behind, nosing out sunflower seeds.Okra, cauliflower, bamboo shoots, lemons, beets, Brussels sprouts, grapefruit, sprouted mung beans, tomatoes, oranges, pumpkin, cabbage, sweet peppers and radishes are also decent sources for the calorie-conscious.I’m also concerned that most nuts and seeds may throw of your omega 6/3 ratio and that they’re highly concentrated in calories. Seems to me that veggies are a better option. Paulc: Nice reply.  I’m wondering where you got your data for the amount of phytosterols in various plants.  For example, how did you figure out that “…lettuce, capers and sour pickles would be the top choices…”  I’m interested in trying to understand how all of this translates into practical eating and seeing a table with the data you are talking about coold be really helpful.  Thanks.I find your calorie interest so fascinating. Since tweaking my diet I find I can’t get enough calories. If I don’t include nuts and seeds in my diet I end up losing weight.  I imagine you’re very physically active so that you can get away with eating a few nuts and seeds. I tend to gain weight with them and have to be careful and have to diet a couple or three days a week to avoid gaining weight.now Paulc aren’t we all supposed to be getting an hour of cardio a day? Nutrition is only part of the equation.  What I’ve read indicates that high intensity interval training is preferable. I also do bodyweight exercises and stretching.Well actually no. 60 minutes of cardio is the best. (on most days)  The heart loves to beat at a moderate training rate for a prolonged time. http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise/But what I tell my patients is that if it gets you moving its good. What is your high intensity work out? You get your HR up high (180 ) and hold it there for how long? And strengthening exercises of course. (bodyweight exercises?). I think stretching is kinda overrated unless you have a joint with a decreased range of motion. There is actually quite a bit of research that demonstrates stretching might encourage injury. Plus who has that kind of time! The longest bar in the chart is wheat germ, but it’s also very high in gluten.According to Dr. Greger’s gluten videos, unless one has a gluten allergy or intolerance gluten should not be an issue. If gluten is an issue, luckily there are other items that one can pick from the chart.Gluten IS good for 99% of people (but not for the 1% who have celiac disease): http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-gluten-bad-for-you/In fact, if there is no good medical reason to go gluten free; it may even be bad for an individual’s good gut bacteria to go gluten free: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-gluten/Sorry, but there is lots of evidence that the extra gluten bred into the endosperm of modern grains is a low level problem for many people irrespective of whether they are technically ‘gluten intolerant’. The amount of gluten now consumed is much higher than any traditional grain diet over the past thousands of years. Obviously I made the post to warn those who had a known gluten problem, but were unaware that wheat germ is one of the highest sources. Gluten intolerance is much higher than 1% and you don’t have to have celiac desease to have a problem with it. I also never used the words “gluten free”.Maybe I missed it in some other part of this discussion/thread, but given the brevity of your initial comment in this thread (the one after Paulc’s comment), I don’t think your intention was obvious at all. In any case, I was simply pointing out Dr. Greger’s videos on gluten since you raised the topic of gluten. (To be clear, I never attributed the term “gluten free” to you. “Gluten free” is term that I used to summarize the second video that I referenced.) I look forward to learning more about the wheat/gluten issue as more empirical information about it rolls out.  At the moment, it seems to me to be a bit over-hyped.  I think that in due time, science will reveal more, but for now I think the science on the matter is still too young to be broadly applicable (or, at least, applicable to me).Hi WholefoodchomperSo I have spent the last 1/2 hour looking for this research article but I can’t find it. So you have to take my word for it. One of my patients is a gastroenterologist. He knows gluten gives me a stomach ache and fatigue. So he gives me this article from JAMA published 2011 (I think) regarding gluten intolerance. The message was that there are people who are not actually testing positive for celiacs but have symptoms. The bottom line was to do an elimination diet and challenge gluten after 6 weeks. And then to be careful because it is in a lot of processed foods as thickeners. It even went so far as to suggest a diet. I can’t tell you how refreshing it was to read the research article. Was the medical profession finally coming on board? Was my patient finally going to address it and stop recommending the “little purple pill?” Thanks for sharing the info, veganrunner. If you happen to find that JAMA citation, could you please share it with me. (Do you remember any key words in the title? Maybe I could do some research on my end as well.)I have had the Celiac blood test done, and I’m in the clear. Thankfully, I don’t experience any symptoms after eating wheat either. (Although, I know that there are people who do, and I do not mean to discount their experiences.) Still, I would like to read about it to learn some more. Heck, I may even try the elimination diet to see if I feel better in some way.Ok. Here is a good review. I think it might be one of the articles mentioned.http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(12)00088-1/fulltextThanks for sharing.  I’ll add it to my reading list.Thanks for sharing.  I’ll add it to my reading list. Ellen: It is also confusing to me.  Thanks for asking this question!So are pistachios, almonds, pine nuts, macadamia nuts, and cashews all better to eat instead of walnuts to lower cholesterol?  I’m a bit confused.  I thought walnuts were the magic nuts to pop.We have to see the bigger picture – as well as there are no magic pill to cure the diseases from the SAD (and european) there are no single nut, seed, vegetable, fruit, legume, nutrient etc who will do the trick. The message is to eat a variety of plant foods, not just one kind of nut, one kind of vegetable etc.So eat a variety of plant foods and avoid meat, eggs and dairy – my advice would be to enjoy the great taste of plant food, and stop thinking that this nut lowers cholesterol, this vegetable lowers the risk of cancer, this berry fights infection – this way of thinking spoils the pleasure of eating great tasting plant foods.Exactly! Variety is the spice of life!  Walnuts are promoted for their omega-3 content, so the phytosterols are just a bonus. Flax seeds also a good source as Dr. Greger has noted in several videos.Maybe you help me check some studies on guggul. It’s the main Ayurvedic herb for “cholersterol” (and arthritis). There are other herbs that have cataloged phytosterols but who knows if they matter ; they are more used for other conditions. Ashwanganda is also sometimes used for cholesterol. As far as grains, I’d guess barley is best for this, and it’s also recommended by Hippocrates for the summer.Reading some of these posts, I have formed the impression that many vegans are unclear on how many nuts we can consume before exceeding guidelines. To remedy this problem, I am performing a calculation below on how many walnuts a day someone on a 2000 calorie diet can consume before they would exceed the Institute of Medicine recommendations.The Institute of Medicine recommends that adults get 20 to 35% of calories from fat. Source: http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-for-Energy-Carbohydrate-Fiber-Fat-Fatty-Acids-Cholesterol-Protein-and-Amino-Acids.aspx   For this calculation I am assuming that the fat contribution of grains, fruits, legumes  and most vegetables are generally so low that they make a negligible contribution to our daily fat intake; correction for these sources of fat should not alter my calculation substantially. Let’s adopt the upper limit of 35% set by the Institute of medicine and see how many walnuts that equals.    For a 2000 calorie diet this amounts to 2000 x 0.35 = 700 calories from fat. Since fat has 9 calories per gram, therefore, 700 calories of fat equals 78 grams of fat.Since each ounce of walnut has 18 grams of fat, the number of ounces of walnuts we can eat is 78g / 18 g = 4.3 ounces.Please note that 4.3 oz of walnuts equals 120 grams of walnuts, which is just over one cup.Please also note that saturated fat for this serving would be around 7 grams, which is 36% of daily value, well within guidelines.Of course, some of us have higher calorie needs due to our energy output. Therefore, the number of nuts that we can eat would go way up!I am not suggesting that we get all our fat from eating walnuts. I simple want to give people an idea of how many nuts one can eat before exceeding standard recommendations.The problem is that the “recommendation” of 35% of calories from fat is hopelessly wrong; the same guidelines accept 10% of the calories from refined sugar! If you want to stay healthy – wich nature intended – it is 10% calories from fat and 0% calories from refined sugar.Actually nature doesn’t have any intentions, nor does evolution. Neither nature nor evolution take sides on dietary issues.  If we humans want to optimize our diets, then we have to understand the underlying physiological mechanisms that are relevant to nutrition and adjust our diet accordingly. By all means, go ahead and challenge the standard recommendations on fat, but I think you would be more convincing to readers of this website if you backed up your claims with peer reviewed scientific studies.BPCveg, I like your physiological perspective. I’m also quiet wary of evolutionary explanations or justifications based on nature (whether they are for plant-based eating or not).  Historically (and possibly nutritionally) speaking, much harm  has been justified using this sort of logic and reasoning. As far as I am concerned, appeals to evolutionary and natural explanations are a slippery slope.  Sticking to the empirical evidence and physiological reasoning, is the way to go.Good point….lots of misinformation is spread using evolutionary explanations.Wow that’s a lot! Nuts and seeds are probably pretty close in calories so 1 cup of seeds and nuts per day. That would be really hard to do and I eat them both everyday. I have sesame, hemp, flax, sunflower, chia in the fridge and I use probably 2 Tbs in either my oatmeal or smoothy depending on which I feel like. Then throughout the day I may have walnuts, almonds, or pistachio nuts. Maybe 2 oz.John when I watched Forks Over Knives I know the overwhelming message was no fat, no nuts. But didn’t you (if you watched the video) think that message was directed at the population of obese people and/or suffering for heart disease? And that makes since. People who need to lose weight or have heart disease need to really limit their fat intake from nuts, seeds, avocados etc. but Dr. Greger has demonstrated through various research articles that nuts and seeds are rediculously nutritious for us. But 1 cup per day? That doesn’t even sound appetizing!Veganrunner: I completely agree with you that diversifying sources of all nutrients is important. I think my back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that those who center their diets around fruits and vegetables shouldn’t need to worry about having an extra handful of nuts, if they feel like it.BPCveg, you rock!Thank you. I too diversify my fat intake using multiple whole food plant sources. Looking at the chart at the end of the video , it appears one would have to seriously increase one’s intake of nuts and seeds to make a difference in the amount of phytosterols consumed.   Flaxseed, for example, has just 200 mg of phytosterols per 100 grams of flaxseed.  100 grams is 10 tablespoons of flaxseed!!  I usually eat about 1 tablespoon a day.Seeds like sesame, sunflower, pistachio, pumpkin are very high in the ratio of omega 6 to omega 3.  It would appear that increasing one’s consumption of those nuts greatly would very negatively affect the omega 3 ratio, especially if one was eating a low fat diet.By the way, Dr Esselstyn “prescribes” NO nuts for his advanced heart disease patients.Good-morning John,OK everyone correct me if I am wrong–I can take it! :-)The SAD is filled with processed foods. Crackers, cookies, chips etc. And they are very high in omega 6 because they are generally cooked with soy oil or the like. Again high in omega 6 (and trans fat) But for most of the people on this website I will would guess do not eat those products. Therefore our omega 6 to omega 3 ratio is not upside down. We know that whole foods are key. Whole nuts and whole seeds. And maybe the ratio of some are scued towards Omega 6 but don’t you think the health benefits outweigh the paranoia I keep reading about in these comment sections? For the general population who eat all that crap yeah they better stay clear. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe people watching these videos are still eating all the processed stuff, as long as it animal free. So please help me understand this. Dr. SJ what do you think? Are you in bed yet? Denmark right? Yes – Denmark (late afternoon right now).I must emphasize that this is just my opinion: Don`t focus on one single nutrient, one single fruit, nut, legume and don`t focus too much on one single ratio (omega 6/3). If you go for whole foods, plant based and eat a variety of different foods, I don`t see a problem. Personally I also take 200-400 mg  vegan omega 3 pr day though.I agree with you, vegan runner.  And, it seems that Dr. G. does as well.  Here is what he says about omega-6:“I try to think in terms of whole food sources rather than nutrients (have you read The China Study? It has a whole chapter trying to make that point). I’d be happy to talk with you about ratios and percentages, but in terms of practical advice I’d encourage people to minimize their intake of the omega-6 rich oils (such as safflower, sunflower, and cottonseed, and all of the processed garbage manufacturers make with them), and try to eat healthy omega-3 rich whole foods such as walnuts and flax seeds every day. And especially for men as well as women who are expecting, breastfeeding, or even thinking about getting pregnant I would encourage consideration of taking an algae- or yeast-derived long-chain omega-3 supplement.”http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/18/ask-the-doctor-qa-with-michael-greger-m-d-week-2/:)Well said! Thanks.It’s difficult to understand how much 2000mg is, of nuts/seeds; I wish he would have given us a measurement in which we could relate. Nevertheless, I’ve learned more from Dr. Greger, MD, than anyone, than, perhaps, Dr. McDougal.

Tomorrow we’ll examine the role this fruit can play in protecting and repairing DNA. The role of fruit, fiber, and antioxidants in general may help explain why people eating plant-based diets have improved laxation.

This study is really helpful – thank you!Do you know if the study included the patients eating the fuzzy skin on the outside of the kiwi fruit? I’m assuming that it does, just might be harder to get a toddler to eat that…:)  Without any knowledge of this specific case and I am not a pediatrician – one year old with IBS? Are you sure the diagnosis is correct?have you tried blending it? (especially with a high powered blender like vitamix)  i know little ones shouldn’t have too much fibre anyway, i doubt they will miss out by not eating the skin (perhaps check with a nutritionist or pediatrician).  or just conduct your own case study :)I may trial this 2kiwi intervention with my patients. Sometimes it can be 50% placebo effect but hope is what people really need.How is the trial going?  What are your findings?Interesting – but I can’t find where it is detailed – why just kiwi?  – what is in it that other fibrous fruits and veggies don’t have, to single it out? I don’t think you can grow it in your garden in the Northern U.S. But, we can grow a lot of other things that if lots of them eaten every day, we wouldn’t have this epidemic of “IBS”. Instead the Agri-business industry (not in cahoots with the health care industry, that would just be too evil) promotes high-carb, low-fiber, high processed, high sugar or the even more insidious HFCS fried foods, that Americans are conditioned to prefer over real food. Why not do an expose on that next?I didn’t see any mention of wheat intolerance in this article. I had suffered with IBS for most of my life, and was prescribed a purple pill 20 years ago, which masked some of the symptoms but not all. After another 10 years of suffering, I went to an integrated care physician who put me on an elimination diet. Upon re-introduction, I tolerated dairy, soy and most protein, but the minute I ate a piece of bread, my symptoms immediately flared. As long as I stay away from American wheat, I am fine. When I visit relatives in Germany, I can eat the bread, which is good since that is a lot of the German diet! I’m told that the governments are very strict in Europe about food purity and processing. American wheat is evidently altered chemically somehow in processing, even if it is organic and whole grain, and that increases its inflammatory properties. In me, it is like ninja throwing stars sticking into my intestinal walls.I think the take home message is:Just increase your fruit consumption to combat constipation!It was funded by a kiwi producer, so of course they will tout kiwis. Same goes for is this study was funded by Chiquita bananasMy constipation was fixed immensely by adopting a high raw low fat vegan diet. I have colitis, so the flares havent completely gone away, but let me tell ya, it is light years better!Any fruit (and veg) will help with constipation, as long as it is ripe, raw, and isnt one u are allergic to (those with latex allergies would not benefit from eating kiwis! Well, i guess it would solve their poop problems, since ya cant poop when u r 6 feet under…)=)Did anyone notice the newspaper quote refers to Psychological not physiological symptoms. What am I missing?While kiwis appear to be helpful, also keep in mind that lactose intolerance presents many of the same symptoms as IBS.  It wasn’t until we transitioned to a whole foods, plant-based (vegan) diet that we realized my spouse’s years of IBS were, in fact, years of dairy (lactose) intolerance. I believe that many IBS symptoms can be caused by fructose and other sugars and sugar alcohols aka FODMAPs.  Check out Sue  Shepherd’s work in Australia on fructose malabsorption.  Kiwi has more fructose than glucose.  The fructose causes gas, bloating, diarrhea/constipation, and depression.Hi Dr. Greger, my wife and I have adopted a whole food plant based diet for about 6 months now. I am 42 yo and my cholesterol is 125 total, BP 107/73, HR 54 and I weigh 158lbs! Your videos have helped us very much and we really appreciate you and want to say thanks. One issue that I’m still struggling with is constipation. I drink 3 liters of water/day and drink green juice every morning without fruit. I’ve tried the kiwi thing and other “remedies” to no avail. I definitely have some good BM days though:) Can you help me become a “regular guy”? Thanks!What about those with diarrhea and urgent bowel movement prone IBS? I am trying to eat vegan, but find that most healthy vegetables only result in cramps, gas, urgent BM”s and diarrhea for me. Kale, cabbage, uncooked veggies, etc. “do me in” as does too much raw fruit. I have undergone numerous tests for all kinds of digestive conditions and was finally told I have a “short, rapid transit time” and resulting irritable bowel condition. What natural foods might help me??? I am a senior suffering with this for 5 yrs. now. Otherwise healthy. No cause established for this. Spicy foods are also a very big problem.Sorry to hear about your situation. You still don’t have a good diagnosis. I consider IBS a “condition” with many causes. The medical industry will probably not be able to give you one but the tests can help narrow it down and make sure you aren’t missing something that we can treat. An approach which might help you has been described by Dr. John McDougall. I recommend that you go to his website and look up free lectures and view his lecture, The Starch Solution. You could purchase John and Mary McDougall’s book by the same name which also contains alot of recipes that Mary has had success with over the years. I would read two newsletter articles available on Dr. McDougall’s website. Chained to the Bathroom(11/02) and Diet for the Desperate(12/02). Those references should give you some ideas for next steps. There are many likely diagnoses for your condition but what you need to do is find out something that works for you. Good luck.Thank you for this quick response. I will look up Dr. McDougall’s website with lectures. I have been seen by a number of gastroenterologists to include being seen at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. Same diagnosis after many, many testing procedures….IBS-D –a functional disorder, etc. Again, thank you for your recommendation.Hi I too have this situation “tied to the Bathroom” it’s been suggested that IBS could be related to my FM and I should treat the bowl inflammation by raising the Lyrica level that i’m taken . I now take 25MG and that I should step up top to 50MG which would address the IBS . Any thoughts On this issue?If I were you, I would try to eat prunes. I heard that you can add them to water and they will become juicer if you hate the taste of them. I would also try to eat foods that are high in antioxidants.

Here is the link to Dr. Greger’s video preventing and treating diarrhea with probiotics:http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-and-treating-diarrhea-with-probiotics/I am a cancer researcher, so it is fair to say, I care about my nutrition. I wanted to add my voice to yours by saying NUTRITION, and LIFE STYLES determines not only how long one lives, but more importantly how well ! I eat 2-3 pounds of raw fruits and veges every day. Every other day, baked salmon, and once a month or so a serving of lean beef. I am 73 years old, exercise one hour per day, have 2-4 BMs every day ! I do not get sick, and yes I take vitamin supplements, especially vitamin-C, 25,000 MGs per day. My dad, whose example I follow, lived until 97. When I pass my 100 birthday, I plan to do a film, on how living to 100 can be fun, safe and healthy. Oh, of course I do not smoke, nor drink hard liquor, nor have ever used narcotics.

There are 25 other videos on inflammation and hundreds of other videos on more than a thousand subjects if you’d like more information.This is Fantastic to have supportive research to confirm what I see in my practice everyday!  Thanks for finding that study because it validates all the remissions I have had in Crohns and Ulcerative Colitis cases who go on plant based lifestyles.Best cases: I have a 10 yo boy (now 11) and his sister 8 yo (now 9) who were sufferers of Crohns and UC respectively.  Both had been to Pediatric GI docs and had visual and biopsy confirmation of their diseases.  Both were placed on Remicad and had multiple bursts of Prednisone.I convinced their Mom to go Vegan and guess what. . . both are in remission, are off their meds and have had no flare-ups since December last year.  Both are now back playing sports and excelling at being kids something that both hadn’t experienced since 7 and 6 years old.I must give credit to John McDougall, MD who helped guide me in the process of understanding the power of plant based diets.  And also for having Michael Greger, M.D. speak at his Advanced Study Weekends where I was mesmerized by Dr. Greger’s interactive lectures and learned of NF.org.Can’t beat the Power of Plants!How fortunate for your patients who are in remission because they changed their eating habits/diet!  That is considered a miracle in my book!  Your response gives me hope and believe me, that’s a big deal.  Thank you! My son, Noah, was dx in 12/09 w/Crohn’s.  He was 12 yrs. old at that time.  He started out with Sulfazaline, then went to 6mp and now Remicad.  He’s being tx’d at Loma Linda & has seen 3 GI’s so far.  NO ONE is acknowledging diet being a paramount factor in healing.  I feel like I’m on an island all by myself, since I know better.    My brain is on overload trying to learn, absorb, and dissipher (sp) all this information about Crohn’s. At this point, my biggest dilemna is convincing my now, 14 yr old Noah, to go Vegan.  He’s headed for boarding school in August and my heart is up in my throat trying to get this under control and figuring out how I can make this happen before then.  He is extremely resistant/sensitive to certain textures of food and has cravings for unhealthy foods (processed).  It’s been a real struggle to get him to eat fruits and veggies because all he really wants to eat is meat at every meal.  I have made a valiant effort to provide a balanced diet, homemade yogurt, fruit smoothies, veggies, homemade bone broths and the like.  He’s turned his nose up to all that I’ve mentioned.   Are there any guidelines to follow in regards to the appropriate nutrients a boy needs while eating Vegan?  Do you recommend supplements and probiotics?  How about a mutlivitamin? Can a Vegan diet be elemental (liquid) too?  How often do you scope your patients w/Crohns? Forgive me, please.  Do I sound like I’m about to go over the edge? This has been overwhelming to say the least.  I just want what’s best for my son.  These new biologic drugs, or drugs of any sort, given to a 14 yr old boy for an unlimited amount of time seems careless when there’s no other discussion about other healthier alternatives that have less side effects.  I’ll continue to search until I’m satisfied with the answer.  That’s the least I can do for the love of my life……  : )Blessings to all!Traportka, I don’t have a lot of time right now but I will try to give you as much information I can because of your sense of urgency.I know it is difficult to get children to change.  I have two, a 14 and 12 year old boys.  Both were hard to change but persistence and education were big factors in their making the switch.  I had them watch the Cheese/Mite video http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheese-mites-and-maggots/ To show them what is put into our foods.I had them watch part of Carnism by Melanie Joy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vWbV9FPo_Q Fast forward to the part where she shows animals have feelings and then how they slaughter animals. Warning it is not for the faint of heart.  And I MADE my children watch this. There was no barganing.  It’s imperative they  understand where the meat comes from and they needed to understand the cause and effect of their choices. You could also have them watch Earthlings which is sickening but important. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce4DJh-L7Ys Here are some success stories from patients at Dr. John McDougall’s website which are inspirational and hopefully identifiable with your son http://drmcdougall.com/stars/andrew_neuman.htmI can’t find one of the Star McDougallers, she had Crohns or UC and cured it at age 65 I think.Have a talk with your son about cause and effect and that the choices he makes today will have profound consequences tomorrow for his body (but be gentle aboout it).Most importantly, tell him the reason you are trying to get him to change is because you love him more than anything in the world and you don’t want to see someone you love, with all your heart, suffer.I have to go but I hope this helps. Sincere regards.Thank you for being so generous with your time and the information you shared.  It is greatly appreciated. My concern is the time constraint of implementing and introducing a vegetarian diet when I am a beginner at best.  My son will eat the food that I prepare or buy.   Another obstacle, which I am sure can be overcome in time, is that I have to provide and prepare the food ahead of time and then transport it to my son while he is away at school for the week.  These are just some the logistics involved! After some serious thought, I will step back for just a bit to catch my breath and come up with a plan.  I may have to ease into this gradually before I can fully implement. I know I am on the right track.  It’s just a daunting task, to say the least, to be told by the medical professionals in charge of your child’s health that diet doesn’t play a role in regaining good health.  If that doesn’t blow one’s mind, I don’t know what will! In my humble opinion, just as “carnism” is barbaric and disturbing, so is ignoring the dietary nutritional needs of a growing teenage boy under doctors care.Can’t wait to see how this all turns out once Obamacare takes full effect.   Traportka, I just had those two children follow up today in my office.  They are still in remission and still Plant based.  He and his sister came in today because they needed immunizations to start back at public shool.  Originally they were home schooled because they wer so sick and lethargic they couldn’t handle a full day at public school. Since going plant based they have been doing perfectly and have had no flare-ups.  You son can do this too.This is just fantastic and should give you hope and the energy to forge forward into going plant based with your son.All the best.Hello. I see you posted this a year ago, so I am really hoping that you still follow this discussion. I am mom to a five year old girl dx with chrons disease at age 3. We originally had her on pentasa which only worked for a few months before we found the SCD diet. That helped for a few months until she had another flare which we then had to higher her dosage. That helped, we took her off the meds and continued with the diet but once again she is in a flare. I just recently started finding information on following a plant based diet and juicing. I never would of thought that it could work bc of all of the roughage and fiber, but the success stories can’t be denied. It’s just that this information conflicts with all of my previous knowledge, so I don’t really know where to start. How do you start implementing a diet that is quite opposite from what I know. Do you take it slow? Or do you just go straight in eating all sorts of fruit and veggies. I’m assuming that this diet is also eliminating all processed foods as well. I should also add that she has obvious sensitivities to fruit/sugar and I suspect that she has problems with candida. Do you know if this diet would help with that as well? I’m sorry to ask so many questions, I’m just desperate. I know it’s a long shot me posting on here from a post from a year ago, but it’s worth a shot.Yes a Vegan diet will help. The child that I referred to in the previous post one year ago is still doing well but does every once in awhile have a flare up when he gets stressed (according to his mother) and has to take some shorts bursts of prednisone. But the whole family is now Vegan because of the benefits they have seen in their son and daughter.I have had about 10 patients with significant Inflammatory Bowel disease all of whom have benefited from a plant based diet. And yes it is contrary to what current medicine teaches. Why? I would rather not speculate b/c then I would sound very negative.There is substantial evidence too about Crohns being infective from a bacteria in dairy called Mycobacterium Avium Paratuberculosis (MAP) that seems to colonize the bowel and is difficult to eradicate.A physician in Australia, Dr. Brody (http://www.cdd.com.au/pages/disease_info/crohns_disease.html) has performed extensive research this inflammatory bowel disease is primarily infectious from MAP (FOUND IN NEARLY ALL DIARY PRODUCTS AND CANNOT BE PASTEURIZED-research shows it’s even in milk based infant formula) and needs to be treated with long term antibiotics and has had fairly good success rates. Unfortunately from what I can tell he doesn’t incorporate much dietary change.Anecdotally, Dr. McDougall, MD and myself can vouch for the success of inflammatory bowel disease with a Plant-Based (Vegan) lifestyle. http://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/health-science/hot-topics/medical-topics/bowel-problems/ Scroll down to: Ulcerative Colitis Relapses with Meat and Beef and read A patient success story: http://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/health-science/stars/stars-video/sondra-berk/A great place to start is the info at PCRM (Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine) and the Vegetarian Starter Kit: http://www.pcrm.org/factsheets/Click Health and Nutrition Literature, sign up with your email address for free then download the Kit and many other good easy to read literature titles to help with understanding disease and recipe’s.I’m 100% sure the diet will help but there is evidence that pharmacologic treatment may be necessary. So try the lifestyle changes first (no risk in that at all) and if it doesn’t completely get rid of the disease then consider antibiotic treatment.What a great study ! This is as good as it gets. Plant Strong is anti inflammatory. No doubt. If I recall medschool right the GI docs warned against to much fiber in Crohns, because of strictures in the intestine, so will they implement this powerfull, healing, cheap, safe “disease modifying drug”?Sterols vs SteroidsRadicchio vs RemicadeSalad vs SalazopyrineIn med school that is exactly what I was taught–a low-residue diet (low in fiber) for UC, IBS, Crohns Dz.  (They also taught no nuts or seeds with Diverticulosis because it will cause Diverticulitis which has also been proven to be bogus!)That never made sense to me because I already knew that high fiber intake decreased bowel transit time (moved it through faster) and food being in contact with the bowel less time meant less irritation to the bowel wall.  I also knew that meat and dairy were one of the most irriating things to those delicate intestinal walls.  So why low fiber?Well without my doing a Lit search I’ll bet there are some real ‘good’ studies out there proving crappy diets (meat and dairy) help people feel crappy but are made to sound like they heal everything.  Bet they’re funded by big AG as well.  I’ve already seen a bunch of those studies and it is rediculous, no, Ludicrous that the junk gets published. Lesson learned, Crap perpetuates crap, and quality perpetuates quality.  I vote for quality! One up for plants!No, One Million UP FOR PLANTS!!!!The lion has a short intestinal tract because “it knows” that you have to get the toxic wasteproduct from meat out as fast as possible.Kale vs colectomy !Keep up your energy my friendPerhaps, or it’s because herbivores need longer GITs because fiber greatly inhibits digestion, so longer transit times (and a well-developed cecum full of helpful bacteria) increase utilization of nutrients. The anti-animal-foods agenda here is tiresome.Fiber inhibits digestion [in humans]? Where is your evidence for making such a comment and resulting hypothesis? It may take longer to digest fiber, but that does not mean “fiber greatly inhibits digestion”. The overwhelming amount of scientific evidence indicates the benefit of fiber ingestion in humans to greatly aid in digestion (not to mention help treat diabetes, heart disease, constipation, just to name a few). The digestion process in humans begins the moment food enters the human mouth and ends at the anus. (How does fiber inhibit digestion from mouth to anus?) Most absorption of nutrients takes place in the later sections of the small intestine, and not the large intestine (where the cecum is located). Substances that cannot be broken down in the small intestine by the body pass through the large intestine where the last bits of water, ions, and salts are reabsorbed, and the remaining solid material, exits through the anus.  According to my reading and understanding of the cecum, “[m]ost mammalian herbivores have a relatively large cecum, hosting a large number of bacteria, which aid in the enzymatic breakdown of plant materials such as cellulose…. In contrast, obligatory carnivores, whose diets contain little or no plant material, have a reduced cecum….”  If anything the design of the human GI tract and the larger cecum seem to indicate that we have it precisely to aid in the breakdown of plant food and not animal food. If humans were designed to eat a primarily meat-based diet, it seems to me that we’d be designed with a smaller cecum and not one that is as “well-developed” as our own.  Moreover, in regards to transit time and the human GI tract, when analyzing the transit time of omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans, the transit time in humans was longer for meat eaters and “as dietary fibre increased mean transit time decreased” (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1433202/). In other words, the transit time is longer for humans eating a meat-based diet. Again, this fact seems to indicate to me that humans are meant to eat a more plant-based diet by (GI tract) design. As for the, “anti-animal agenda” expressed in this forum, it’s just the scientific facts (true, it is often mixed in with a bit of passion).  If you have good scientific evidence indicating another point-of-view, please do share it. We are more than willing to analyze and discuss it here.  It need not be “tiresome” at all.Very informative and thoughtful. Thank you.Maybe it is time for you to do some comparative physiology of the human gut!Here, I’ll even help you out.  Read the works of one of the most prominent and well published works of Katherine Milton, PhD who is a distinguished professor of physical anthropology at UC Berkeley.  Her research focuses on the dietary ecology and digestive physiology of Primates, both humans and non-humans.Hello there, my name is Aris and I am from Cyprus, a small European Union country. A person very close to me was recently diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. She’s only 5 years old. Perhaps you can direct me to some milk-replacement products for the child, since milk was more or less, what she considered her favourite beverage (and from what I’ve read so far, probably that’s the cause of the disease too). Anyway, I would be very grateful if you could help me, either by posting over here, or, if its not too much trouble, sending me an email at a.i.1979@hotmail.com Thank you very much  Hello Aris, My heart goes out to your friend. Hopefully, the information that you are learning on this site will help treat your friend’s Crohn’s disease.I’m not sure what is available in Cyprus, but there are many plant-based milk alternatives available here in the States.  Maybe you can find some in your area (or at least on the internet). The alternatives are: Soy Milk, Almond Milk (and other nut milks), Rice Milk, Hemp Milk, and Oat Milk.  There may be more, but these are the ones that come to mind.  You can do an internet search for “milk alternatives” to see what else might come up.  If some of these milk alternatives are not available in your area, you can make you own non-animal based milks (you can research recipes on the web).  The key is to stay away from animal milks/proteins.  Luckily, there are a variety of alternatives available.  Wishing you the best of luck and your friend a speedy and healthy recovery!Thank you very much Jola. You’ve been more than helpful. :) I’m not a doctor, but until someone who knows more than me responds to you, consider milk alternatives like almond, rice, and hemp milks. All healthy and no nasty dairy.Dr. Greg,  There is a lot of new study information available on the effects of wheat protein triggering inflammation in non-celiac patients.  My personal experience suggests that wheat may act synchronously with animal protein to increase inflammation.  I’d like to see more about wheat’s negative effects in your video series including its incredibly high glycemic index figure, it’s direct effects in raising advanced glycation end-products, and its neuro effects through wheat exorphines.Doctor I am a 58 year old crohns patient and had surgery a year ago. Constantly have to avoid fat in diet or pay the price. I was trying to find the study mentioned below to study up on the diet and see if I could pull it off. Please advise: steve.coughlin@coughlincomm.com.thank youMy name is Dr. Lester Castro Friedlander,BA,DVM. there is a condition in dairy cows called Johnnes Disease. USDA allows these diseased cows to go to slaughter for human consumption. In various research thru out the years, it has been suggested that there might be a link between Johnnes Disease in dairy cows to Crohn:s Disease in Humans. According to research done in Great Britan, The milk of dairy cows with Johnnes Disease,was pasteurized for Human Consumption. After pasteurization,the bacteria that causes Johnnes Disease, was still present. Pasteurization did not kill the bacteria.Yes, and the bacteria is Mycobacterium avium paratuburculosis (MAP).  Here is a good research article on Crohns and MAP in children which shows the sources of MAP:   “Humans may easily acquire MAP by multiple routes of transmission. MAP is present in pasteurized milk, infant formula milk, breast milk, municipal tap water, surface water, and cow manure (14).” 14. Collins MT. Paratuberculosis: review of present knowledge. ActaVet Scand 2003;44:217–21.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15074635Got pus?What about Bovine Leukemia Virus?Milk is such a great food – apparently you are at risk of acquiring Crohns disease, maybe leukemia, diabetes type 1, osteoporosis, breastcancer, prostate cancer, CVD, stroke and in the waiting time of your fate you get fat with pimples.What about BLV causing NHL, and Prions causing MadCow (Swiss-cheese brain) disease. I’ll tell you what, the milk industry couldn’t give a rats @$$ about me or my family so I play the same way. I don’t care about them either so everytime I recommend a dairy free diet, which is everyday, I feel like I am freeing my patients from the brain washing and bondage that has kept them sick and enslaved to the medical system. It’s about independence today and everyday. Being able to be free from sickness, free from medications, free to live in good health is abasic human right and to have an industry that is the antithesis of that is . Some would say communistic.Happy Independence Day my friend! Most doctors tell there Crohn’s patients that diet has nothing to do with IBD. What can you do about educating the doctors? Most IBD patients are so sick that they just blindly do what they are told by their doctor, they are too sick to advocate for themselves.Nar, That is a big question to tackle.I think that most doc’s just repeat what they learn in Med School and don’t ever research the literature for the truth.  Also they are so busy (like I am) that they have to make the time (just as I do) to research the facts, and then share them with their patients.  And in the industry increased time with patients equals decreases in income.Also many Doctors are so egocentric in their thinking that they don’t want to be told someone else is right or told how to do things.  That’s why Doctor’s as a group are so splintered.  If we weren’t we would be the most powerful lobbying group in the world.  Look at the Teamsters and how powerful they are.  Look at Meat and Dairy (We spend (Fed Govt) 16 Billion a year on subsidies for meat and dairy):  We have way to many leaders with few willing to follow.I educated doc’s by having them see my patients get better which happens all the time but I have had only two docs really take note as to how many of my patients improve.  One is a Rhuematologist who has told his patients, “I don’t what he does but all my patients that see him tend to get better.”  Also one doc in my practice has started eating Vegan and I caught him taking some recipes home from PCRM’s Vegetarian Starter pack and Jeff Novicks Fast Food DVD printout.  Today he baked some brilliant Vegan scones for after out Mountain Bike ride.  A small triumph!This is what I tell all my patient’s, “Educate yourself”.  Don’t believe what I say look up the facts.  So I give them the reputable websites, Physicians and Dieticians so they can go read and learn more.  There is nothing more important than your own body and self, so if you want the best from it learn about it.Tell everyone you know about: http://www.Nutritionfacts.org http://www.VeganMd.org  Michael Greger, M.D. http://www.PCRM.org Neal Barnard, M.D. http://www.DrMcDougall.com http://www.NutritionCME.org http://www.NutritionMD.org http://www.PRMI.org  Dean Ornishes, M.D. http://www.TColinCampbell.org http://www.HeartAttackProof.com  Caldwell Esselstyn, M.D.Have everyone watch Forks Over Knives Read The China Study, The Starch Solution. Buy DVDs of Lectures from many great speakers at Dr. mcDougalls website.  He tapes all his advanced Study Weekends for purchase.  Buy them as a group of people and then trade them as you watch them.Dr. McDougall tried to get a nutrition bill passed in California for Dos to be educated but it got torn apart.  Dr. G has four vids about it on NF.  Just type in Nutrition Bill to watch them.Bottom line: Eat Plants FIRST because we have learned beyond even any unreasonable doubt that they heal and Second: Educate yourself (maybe at the same time would be best).I hope this helps.Share these websites with as many people you can and help educate the world. The more people know the more they will change.Very well said.The China Study is fantastic.Jeff Novic is great, he has a great sense of humor (“What! Its water…”) You are right the only thing I can do is spread the word. I have been doing that, but people think that I am trying to sell something. Nobody wants to hear that their beloved hamburger that they are addicted to is making them sick.Love how you answer this question, and I love the links! However, for some wacky reason the PMRI link you have listed leads to the “Presbyterian-Reformed Ministries International” website instead of Dr. Ornish’s “Preventative Medicine Research Institute.  Ah, I figured it out.  A minor typo (PMRI and not PRMI) is to blame; the correct website is:  http://www.pmri.org/ ).Before I sign off, I also want to add that it is so refreshing and encouraging to see practicing docs on this site.  I also wish there were more docs who were on board with plant-based interventions, eating, and lifestyle.  Any advice, on how a regular person with regular insurance can go about finding a “plant strong” primary doctor?  Last I checked, that was not one of the boxes one could check off in the insurance selection filters when researching doctors.Thanks!  Corrected!Plant Strong– Engine2?Regarding Info on Plant Based/Strong Docs http://www.drmcdougall.com/doctors/ Just type in your Zip Code and see if any are close.Thanks, Doc.  I actually found that reference soon after I posted my question (using the web-site links that you shared above). I think that self-registry database is a good place to start.  However, it still seems pretty limited to me given how many doctors there are. (A search for California listed just 62 results and not all of them doctors.) Better than nothing, I suppose. It’d be great if insurance companies could incorporate something similar into their doctor databases. I’d love to have a primary care doc who was open to plant-based interventions/lifestyles.  As for “Plant Strong– Engine2?”. I have not read that particular book yet (have read many others by “the usual suspects”, but have heard the term “plant strong” and I like it.  Plant strong, plant based= same thing. No?The Plant-Strong term was created to have a broader appeal, especially to the masculine side of life.Any specific diet suggestions?  I’ve been doing a fruit-based diet to help with my UC and its helping, but im not symptom-free. However, when i try to eat things other than fruit (starchy veg, legumes, nuts/seeds, gluten-free grains..grains are the worst), my symptoms flare. Any advice?Also, do u recommend any supplements like digestive enzymes and probiotics?  I’ve read that these actually dont help much and that enzymes can make the body “lazy” and dependent on outside sources of enzymes.  Is this true?Also, are fermented foods helpful (homemade yogurt, raw sauerkraut, etc)? thanksIn med school you learn basically nothing about health and nutrition. It is fancy to prescribe drugs, performe surgery, but not sexy to recommend carrots and brocholi. In addition most patients wants a pill to cure the problemIt’s the American way Stefan–Instant Gratification; it’s what pills offer. I Disagree about the “Plants aren’t sexy.” though. Check out the pic Below ;-“I love carrots!Sadly you are right. Money rules, not the truth. How we ever came to believe, that milk is good for us, is a puzzle. Milk for all animals is for their babies, and milk from another species? That is strange.Happy Independence Day to you and your family, dr dynamic.BTW, Nice pic!  Healthy looking young man! Keep up the great work! Vegans look better ! ;-) :-)For some strange reason I have problems creating my avatar and the picture ended up the wrong place!I have had to absorb a lot of info. in a relatively short period of time.  However and ironically, I know of a little girl who just resetnly tested positive for MAP or Johnnes Disease.  I was shocked to discover a veternian did the blood test!  The child has Crohn’s disease, just like my son.   GI docs don’t even attempt to address the issue, at least not here in the U.S.  Am I correct in my understanding that when the bacteria transfers from a cow to a human the growth rate of the bacteria is very slow, in that it could take years to manifest itself into something that causes intestinal problems? What are the symptoms of MAP in children?  Why aren’t doc’s automatically testing for it once a Crohn’s dx is established?  So amazing!  It’s good to be a vegan.  :-)Hello, i have a question about Liposomal Vitamin C. Dose it have any additional benifits Vs Normal vitamin C like improved absorbsion or is it all hype?Thanks alot. I wouldnt put too much weight on it. As Dr. Greger has pointed out, supplements are cheap and marketers will find all sorts of ways to try and sell them at higher than necessary prices. Vitamin C is very abundant in the plant world and deficiencies of vitamin C while on a healthy whole foods vegan diet are unheard of and I don’t see how they could be possible.Awesome! Plant-based diets heal, I have no doubt about it. I do wonder about the accuracy of the headline on your video though. Clicking thru to the main study you discuss, I noted a paragraph near the end that states that the semi-vegetarian diet is “effective for relapse prevention,” but that the authors’ concern with “rapid, safe and reliable” induction of remission, which they say they achieve via infliximab. So it seems to me that the study demonstrates not that plant-based diets achieve remission but that they help sustain it. Is that right?p.s. – Either way, more GI docs need to hear the message that diet does matter to Crohn’s and other IBD. The standard line is that it doesn’t.Dr Greger,Many people with IBD have a lot of trouble tolerating fruits and vegetables and often those in a flare up are put on a “low residue” or “low fiber” diet. What do you suggest for them so that they can follow those guidelines but also try veganism? For the IBD community, minimizing the foods that directly aggravate a flare up is the main priority. I would like to know as well?I wonder if it really is the fruits, vegetables, and fiber that are causing the IBD flares ups. Might it be dairy and/or meat/fish included in the diet that could be contributing to the flare ups?  Any evidence of that in the scientific research?I have Crohn’s and have definitely experienced this, particularly in relation to raw veggies. There have been times when the easiest foods for me were white bread and white rice. BUT, I’ve always tried to transition from those times to a diet rich in veggies and fruits. Sometimes, boosting easy-to-digest antioxidants like spices (turmeric) helps. Other times, I sneak in veggies like a mom with a picky kid, blending them in sauces and drinking smoothies, until my body is ready for the heartier stuff.Why do some people get Crohn’s and others don’t?  I would like to know if the incidents of Crohn’s is increasing? And if so why? Also what is the risk for family members of a Crohn’s patient of getting Crohn’s?Could you please post the reference for this study?  Thank you.References are all listed in the sources cited section underneath the video.Additional information on the diet used, excerpted from the article:  “Eggs and milk were used. In other words, our diet was a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet[51]. Miso (fermented bean paste) soup, vegetables, fruits, legumes, potatoes, pickled vegetables, and plain yoghurt were served daily. Fish was served once a week and meat once every 2 wk, both at about a half the average amount.”   Also, “Foods that have been shown to be a risk factor for IBD in or outside Japan, including sweets[20-23,28-30], bread[27], cheese[27-29], margarine[27], fast foods, carbonated beverages, and juices[24,25,29], were discouraged. Healthy habits were encouraged: no smoking, regular physical activity, moderate or no use of alcohol, regularity of meals, and not eating between meals[53].” Semi-vegetarian? Meat once a fortnight? That’s basically full vegetarianism in my book. Anyway, study is interesting but not compelling evidence. Not in view of the meat-heavy SCD (Specific Diet Carbohydrate) diet, which is a diet tailored specially for IBD sufferers and has the glowing testimonials of 1000s of people behind it. And this little study too:http://escholarship.umassmed.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&context=cts_retreatIt’s worth nothing that the SVD diet began with test subjects who were in full remission, whereas in the link I posted the test subjects had active disease. It’s easier to maintain remission than it is to get into remission in the first place.Anyway, I’m not pro-SCD, but I don’t think there is nearly enough evidence yet to declare the definitive diet for Crohn’s. Far more studies need to be done.I have been trying tell people this for years and now my RAW STAR Recipe book WON The #1 Best Vegetarian Cookbook in the USA Award 2012 by The Gourmand World Cookbook Awards because my recipes are fast, fun, easy and super delicious. It is also only 2, 5 or 10 minute recipes, is all natural new and amazing and 100% Plant Based designed with doctors and health experts for the most healthy, nutritious and balanced delicious plant based diets so now is satisfying, new, and gourmet too in just minutes: http://www.RawStarRecipes.comThank you, Dr. Greger, for helping get the word out about dietary treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.  I suffered with ulcerative colitis (initially diagnosed as Crohn’s) for more than 10 years and was taking quite a lot of medication with little relief when I finally happened upon the concept of arresting IBD with a medically supervised water-only fast followed by a vegan diet.  I sought treatment at TrueNorth Health Center and was fortunate to be introduced to Dr. Michael Klaper, who managed my case.  The treatment was a resounding success.  No more meds, no more of the better known UC symptoms (the gut pain, diarrhea, etc.), no more of the lesser known UC symptoms (joint pain, low-grade fever, etc.).  In short, I feel great and I love the food.  If only the gastroenterologist who treated me for years were even remotely interested in how Dr. Klaper helped me achieve remission!  Oh, and thank you also for your amazing work of monitoring, interpreting and reporting that’s represented on this website.  Many people have asked me for information about my UC “cure” (and the accompanying weight loss, boost in energy, etc.), and this website is one of the resources I can refer my friends and family to for reliable information.  Good work!I tried to get into truenorth for my UC, but they rejected me and wouldnt tell me why, other than I was “too complicated.”  What does THAT mean?!  So, now I have no way of healing my gut bc I’ve tried everything else adn TrueNorth was my last option.  How long were u there and when did u go?  How long did u fast?  Were u on any supplements/meds and are u still on any?What is your current daily diet?  If u could provide a log of a typical day, that would rock!I would love to find out more info about ur experience!  ThanksExcellent resources!  Thank you!! ;-}Thanks.  Yikes, sorry about the multiple posts. Disqus was acting temperamentally. Many thanks to you for taking the time to respond and share.  I definately feel empowered now since I have a place to start.  All the best to you. Hey Doc. My friend has Colitis. He’s been vegan for about a year. He eats a lot of bananas, white rice, potatoes, some carrots and peas mostly. I’ve encouraged him to eat foods with higher levels of antioxidants. I’d also like to see him try nuts. He intends to eat more fruit and vegetables in the future (especially greens in the form of juice). Do you think fresh green juice would be as good as the whole thing? I’m guessing not. Besides eating more antioxidant rich foods, nuts, greens and anti inflammatory foods in general, is there much more I can recommend? I’ve heard a lot about people healing from Crohns on a vegan diet rather quickly, but I don’t hear much about Colitis. Is there a reason for this?Thanks To address ur concern of juicing, Dr. Greger answers that here in his video http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/fruit-juice-fail/Oh and he has made a lot of progress by the way, since going vegan, but still feels he has significant issues.Thank You.  I was diagnosed with crohn’s 16 years ago, and have my usual flare ups.  I started looking into a plant based diet a few months ago for my weight and heart, then I started to wander if it would have any effect on my crohn’s.  So I wanted to thank you for this information. My wife and I have been on a plant based diet for over 7 weeks now, and are doing great.In the last several years,alot of research shows that Johnes Disease in Dairy Cows is a direct link to Crohns Disease in Humans. It is also reported that between 60-65 % of the Dairy Herd in the United States has Johnes Disease. According to research done in Great Britain, Pasteurization of Milk from Johnes Cows did not kill the Bacteria,”Mycobacterium Avium Paratuberculosis.” ( MAP ) In other words, People got Crohns Disease thru the milk and milk byproducts.

Dr. Lester Castro Friedlander,BA,DVM  I wish I had this knowledge nearly 30 years ago when I came down with UC. I almost died and had surgery after suffering for two years. While I was never as sick as I was before I had surgery, I still didn’t feel healthy and had other types of inflammation, including arthritis and iritis. Only when I went vegan about 5 years after my initial surgery did I start to feel young again. Nearly 20 years later, I am still very healthy. It was the best decision I ever made. Too bad most doctors don’t have a clue about this subject.I have a question. Recently I had ileostomy, where my big bowel was removed. Is there any dietary recommendations you would offer to me? Perhaps because of the surgery I cannot absorb certain nutrients and I need to eat more of the particular foods? Many thanks.I was diagnosed with Crohn’s in 1973. I became a vegetarian in 1980 (vegan in 2008) and never had a relapse of the disease since, over 33 years!!!!Oh, that’s so fantastic! Thank you for sharing.Toxic, undigestible foods that we are not biologically suited to cause bowel inflammation, colitis and Crohn’s. Via the Vegan Healing Diet Plan I teach in my Self Healing Colitis & Crohn’s book, I have helped thousands heal up. I counsel people with IBD onward to new health every week and am glad to answer questions and help.David Klein, PhD, Hygienic Doctor Director of the Colitis & Crohn’s Health Recovery Center http://www.colitis-crohns.comDr. Greger,When I was fourteen years old, I was diagnosed with U.C. I have tried many different things to help with symptoms, I am currently trying my best to eat a plant based diet. I have read several article about supplementing with the amino acid glut amine for digestive health. Can you tell me anything about this or do you have any videos for this? I haven’t found anything yet on your site. Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.There is scientific literature that supports both glutamine and quercetin in healing the gut. True North Health in Santa Rosa CA supplements their water fasting program with these to help the gut heal. Article on Glutamine in Gut 2009 lead author is Zhou and Quercetin in J Nutr 2009 lead author Suzuki. Certainly a plant based diet is the place to start. I would recommend you read several of Dr. John McDougall’s newsletters… Chained to the Bathroom(Nov 2002), Review of article in Gut on Ulcerative Colitis in his November 2004 newsletter, Diet for the Desperate in his Dec 2002 newsletter and to help clarify the wheat issues further the newsletter in September 2005, Could it be Celiac Disease. Clearly many of our intestinal related illnesses can be reversed by proper nutrition. The devil is in the details and everyone is bit different. Our guts are very complicated ecosystems and the science keeps changing so keep tuned to NutritionFacts.org. View the other videos on this website on Ulcerative Colitis start with…http://nutritionfacts.org/video/titanium-dioxide-inflammatory-bowel-disease/. Good luck.Ive was dıagnosed wıth Chronhs dısease and let me tell you ıt ıs paınfull! I swıtched to a vegetarıan dıet wıth very little daıry for other reasons.

More people should know about thıs.Sounds great, but I was diagnosed with Crohn’s after I had already been on a vegan diet for nearly a year. I admit I could have eaten more healthy vegan foods and less processed foods (which I am working on now), but my disease developed after I became vegan. I had no symptoms before. It occurred suddenly maybe 10 months after I went vegan. I have already cut carrageenan from my diet, working on less processed foods, what else can I do specifically? I’ve also been trying to work out, but nearly every time I try I feel more pain either during, after, or the next day. This is also trying relatively low intensity exercises like swimming or yoga. I also try to choose lower fiber options like white rice instead of brown.It is strongly advised to eliminate animal products from the diet as this is what tends to promote this disease. The issues raised with animal products are irrelevant whether they are organic or not. I do not know of evidence currently showing that a low carb diet will aid with chron’s disease, and it may actually be doing more harm then good.The best dietary approach would be, to again, eliminate ALL animal products, organic or not, and consume plenty of starchy foods, veggies and fruits. There is nothing wrong with potatoes, brown rice, oats, etc.Thank you for your response! Everything you just said goes against everything that I have been reading and studying for the past year and a half. We follow the SCD diet which is specifically geared towards chrons and uc. The basic concept is that complex carbohydrates take longer to digest therefore giving fuel to bad bacteria. We have completely eliminated processed foods from our house and that has made a huge difference. I’m not trying to debate, I am just trying to educate myself. Right now I am willing to try anything that will help get her health back on track. Like I said, scd improved her symptoms but I have yet to see her looking healthy again. I also suspect she has problems w candida. So if you were in my shoes where would you start? Is there a book recommendation that could help educate me on how to start this. I’m so scared to make the wrong decision.I understand your concerns. I personally put full faith into an extremely successful and well known plant based doctor named Dr. Mcdougall. He has had great success in reversing intestinal disease, such as chron’s disease, with a plant based diet built upon complex carbohydrates. You can read his medical opinion regarding the disease here. http://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/health-science/common-health-problems/colitis-severe/Dr. McDougall also has a book on digestion. http://www.drmcdougall.com/health/shopping/books/dr-mcdougalls-digestive-tune-up/You can also send him a personal email or call him with a question regarding your concerns. http://www.drmcdougall.com/about/contact-us/I wish you the best of luck.Amyc1085: I’m not a doctor or an expert, but I thought I could help supply some ideas for your question of “where to start?” I know it can be so overwhelming to change ones diet so much.Dr. HemoDynamic suggested that you take a look at PCRM’s site. I would further direct your attention to their 21 Day Kickstart program (which is free and starts at the beginning of each month). I am thinking that might be a good fit for you because the 21 Day Kickstart program holds your hand through three weeks – everything from grocery lists to meal plans to cooking videos and a community forum monitored by nutrition experts. So, that’s something you might want to look into:http://support.pcrm.org/site/PageServer?pagename=21day_vegan_kickstart&JServSessionIda003=upegog3qg1.app234cAnother idea is to get the cookbook “Let Them Eat Vegan”. The author of this book has young children so she tends to create “kid-friendly” food. But don’t let that label fool you. I’ve been cooking quite a bit out of the book lately and loving the food!My final bit of advice also comes from Dr. Bernard and the PCRM site. While it is best to commit to 3 weeks of whole-food plant-based eating in order to a) break old habits, b) change your taste buds, c) start to see health benefits — it is also important to wait to start your three weeks until you are ready. It is OK to take a week or so and come up with a plan. Experiment with dishes you think your family will like. I think that the PCRM website says something like, “The average family eats a rotation of 8-9 dinners.” Lunch the next day can be leftover dinner from the previous day. And most people eat the same breakfast every morning. (How about smoothies or oatmeal?) So, making this change is not as hard as you would think. Especially since 3 dinners could be foods that you eat now that are almost naturally vegan. 3 dinners could be foods that you eat now that you “veganize.” And 3 dinners could be new dishes that you add to your menus. Looked at that way, you only have to come up with 3 new dishes!My point: You want to go into the 3 weeks with a calm, happy expected attitude rather than fear and concern that you don’t know what to do. There’s plenty of awesome-tasting, filling, fast, and completely healthy food out there. You just have to find what will work for your family.One last tip: I just started watching a DVD from Jeff Novick on “Fast Food”. It’s a great “cooking show” that puts together fast but super-healthy food with simple ingredients that you can get from any grocery store. I think this video could be a huge help to you in trying a whole food plant based diet with your family.http://www.amazon.com/Jeff-Novicks-Fast-Food-1/dp/B00466DP42/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1382384991&sr=8-1&keywords=fast+food+jeff+novickThe best of luck to you. I’m excited for you to take this journey. If you decide to give it a try, please post back and let us know how it went.Amyc1085: I thought of something else I meant to share. The Vegetarian Resource Group (VRG) is a great source of information. They have a page on “Feeding Vegan Kids” that I think is really good. The first part is all about infants. But don’t give up. They get into older kids further down the page.Here is the link and some excerpts that I think are important:http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/kids.php“The best way to assure that your children achieve their ideal rate of growth is to make sure that they have adequate calories. Some vegan children have difficulty getting enough calories because of the sheer bulk of their diets. Children have small stomachs and can become full before they have eaten enough food to sustain growth. The judicious use of fats in forms like avocados, nuts, nut butters, seeds, and seed butters will provide a concentrated source of calories needed by many vegan children. Dried fruits are also a concentrated calorie source and are an attractive food for many children. Teeth should be brushed after eating dried fruits to prevent tooth decay. … Children should get enough calories so that protein can be used for growth in addition to meeting energy needs. Table 17 (page 193) shows one diet plan that has been used successfully by vegan children.”You’ll want to stay away from processed foods like “soy hot dogs” if you can, but I think the general information in the above page is pretty good.Hope that helps!Dr Greger, in addition to abstaining from animal products, what do you think about the claims that link gluten to autoimmune diseases?When I asked my doctor (gastroenterologist) if diet may play a factor in my pancolitis he laughed at me, in a way that was like “There’s no way diet could possibly have anything to do with it; leave the thinking to us doctors and don’t suggest any more silly ideas.” He then told me I would have to take 3 pills 3 times a day (9 pills a day) that he prescribed. I have been symptom free and off the meds for years.Its distressing to think doctors do not have these knowledge tools to share with their patients. A plant based diet should be a first line of defense. These other videos may interest you. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-nutritional-ignorance/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-school-nutrition-education/john: This is a fun story. I like how you managed to fix yourself.Did you use a whole plant food based diet in order to be able to be symptom and med free? Did you have to make a big change in your diet?My mother-in-law has been suffering with crohns for almost twenty years. Her doctor has told her that her diet has nothing to do with her disease and therefore she had been hesitant to change her eating habits. Her doctor has told her that many raw vegetables can irritate her disease. I would like to take her to a doctor in the Dallas area that shares Dr. Gregers ideas on nutrition and crohns disease. Any recommendations?Ok, I am confused. So much info that I’ve read says that fish oil is ANTI-inflammatory, so how can fish be included on an inflammatory food list?I don’t know if anyone will answer this. I have been in severe pain for 19 years. I was born with choledochal cyst/biliary atresia. I have had 7 surgeries from birth including roux en y surgery and repair of 2 narrowed hepatic ducts. Food hurts to eat. I do get cholangitis but since I cut out most food other than Ensure stirred in yoghurt and some fruit I haven’t had a temperature for two years. However, I regularly get hot flashes the whole 19 years, bouts of really severe pain that will go down with IV antibiotics and anti inflammatories help too but after Iv antibiotics the pain comes back quite quickly and slowly builds up again. I’ve now made things worse with this strict diet and had to blockages due to severe constipation so I will have to eat more proper food but eating protein has seen an increase in back pain these last two weeks. I have secondary scelorising cholangitis but although I have significant right lobe damage I am along way from a transplant, I have increased shoulder tip pain this year and body aches that can be severe plus joint pain, I am told my liver is not bad enough to justify the body aches. I was in hospital two wks ago with a second bout of severe constipation and I was treated like dirt by the specialist and accused of lying via little digs. I only learnt last year that he has never believed I am ill and did not interview me on what happened in the uk when I lived there for 4 years–they treated me very well there although I ended up on the wrong team as I did not know chronic pancreatitis had been dismissed. In my late teens I was diagnosed with U/c but I know think they may have been mistaken although I have had mucous back lately but no diarrhea either than or now. My life is very limited and I have to take a lot of pain killers which no longer work well. I am thinking I should try this diet of yours maybe it will help with all the pain. I have a supportive doctor at the liver transplant unit who suggested bacterial overgrowth but the doctor down here doesn’t believe it. It has not helped that because of family reasons at home I have not been able to go in to hospital every time I am in severe pain–I was able to in the Uk although I did not go in if I only had the pain without a temperature, as for many years I was told by my family doctor in NZ, I would be sent home if I only had severe pain. It is really hard to change my behaviour now I know I can go and of course it hasn’t helped that I had problems at home which made me feel I could not go in–this have been resolved. Nz has had massive cutbacks to it’s health care system with the community health care act of 2001–similar ideas have been introduced around the world due to worries over the aging population. Anyway, do you think I may have a chance of this helping my severe pain problem?Chloe: I was waiting to reply to your post because I was hoping that someone more knowledgeable or with related experience would reply.I’m not a doctor, but I have a thought for you that seems reasonable to me: I would guess that you have tried everything else. And while we may not have a lot of studies specifically about your condition, we have seen plenty of studies and a bazillion (I’m sure ;-) ) case studies showing that whole plant food based diet has helped people chronic pain, including joint pain. Since, for *most* (perhaps not all) people, eating a whole plant food based diet can’t hurt and seems to help in so many ways, I would think it would be worth your effort to give it a real try.The trick for someone who is not familiar with this type of eating is to get the details right. You will want to make sure you take a good B12 supplement. And you will want to make sure you are eating whole plant foods, not processed. It can be hard to do if you are in pain and don’t feel like cooking. But there are some things you can do that are extremely easy and extremely healthy. For example, if you can open a can of beans and rinse them. Then put them on a sweet potato that you baked quickly in the microwave. And then poor on some store-bought salsa and maybe some defrosted (pre-chopped) broccoli, you will have a great whole food meal that came together with nothing more than opening containers and a little zapping in the microwave.Two other ideas for you are: Jeff Novick’s DVD on Fast Food. In that DVD you will learn other ways to make easy, whole food plant based meals that are nutritionally excellent. If you are up for a little cooking, you might try the free PCRM 21 Day Kickstart program.http://www.amazon.com/Jeff-Novicks-Fast-Food-1/dp/B00466DP42/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1413302994&sr=1-1&keywords=fast+food+jeff+novickKickstart will hold your hand for 21 days, including meal plans, recipes, videos, inspirational messages, and a forum where you can ask questions. http://www.pcrm.org/kickstartHome/ (Click the green “Register Now” button.)Hope that helps! Also, I’m sorry you are going through so much suffering. I hope it gets better.Hello, I just joined this discussion and I’m hoping I will still get a respond despite my late post. My fiance’ was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease of the large intestine at 21 years old (he is now 37). He’s had three major surgeries (a removal of 85% of his colon, a temporary ileostomy, and a reversal). Three years from his surgery and he is still struggling with his symptoms including chronic abdominal pain and severe fatigue after getting off of Prednisone. I’ve read a little bit about SCD (Specific Carbohydrate Diet) and it’s benefits to Crohn’s disease. Any thoughts of this specific diet? What’s your defense on doctors saying that patients with Crohn’s should not eat vegetables as it is high in fiber? Any input would be greatly appreciated. I’m determined to help him deal with his symptoms along the way and I refuse to believe that diet change would not make a difference on patients with Crohn’s disease! Also, I met a physician that conducts DNA testing that determines the appropriate diet and medications that is better metabolized by an individual. Has any of your heard of this and what’s the reliability of the result of a DNA test for a person’s diet and medication?","['animal products', 'animal protein', 'autoimmune diseases', 'cheese', 'colon health', ""Crohn's disease"", 'dairy', 'fish', 'flexitarians', 'immunosuppressive drugs', 'inflammation', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'meat', 'plant-based diets', 'seafood', 'steroids', 'vegans', 'vegetarians']","Meat (including fish), cheese, and animal protein intake in general have been associated with an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

See yesterday's NutritionFacts.org video-of-the-day Fighting Inflammation in a Nut Shell and Friday's video Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Purple Potatoes.

Health Food Store Supplement Advice covered the shark cartilage question, Is Vitamin D the New Vitamin E? mentions beta carotene, and I have yet to do a video on ginseng but will! In the meanwhile, feel free to check out my dozen other videos on Supplement Snake Oil (more on this in tomorrow’s NutritionFacts.org video-of-the-day) and the hundreds of other videos on more than a thousand topics.Good study for me because everyday I get patients coming in saying they went to their pharmacist to see what they could take for their symptoms.  (They go to the pharmacist because they did not want to “bother” me (pay) for an office visit–Pharmacists are FREE!!).  So I feel safe that the Pharm’s are giving good outpatient advice and telling them to see the doc when they need to but I feel jipped in a way when it comes to people not wanting to pay for good information from a well informed and educated provider. Why? Let’s see. . .My grandmother passed recently and we just got the lawyer bill for the estate: $300 per hour and 31.5 hours came to $9000 and change.  Really?!?My wife went to a dentist recently with my two kids who just inspected their teeth and did absolutely nothing except sell my wife some oral bacterial modifier and charged $750. (Total time spent with kids 1 hour)  Are you kidding me?!?Patients won’t go to the educated physician who tries to get them off their medications and teach them how to make themselves better (if they’re willing to listen) for a $20-$40 copay??????  Comon!  It’s obscene! That’s my two cents worth. Yes today’s vid struck discord (dis-chord) with me.The premium for my individual health plan coverage is $565 a month with a $5,000 annual deductible. My basic essential living costs (housing, utilities, medical insurance premiums, dentist, etc.) are so high that all costs considered, I truly can’t afford to go the so-called educated physician for troubling symptoms. As you well know, although the co-pay may appear to be reasonable, the patient needs to pay up to the deductible for lab tests and other services. And as you also know, for any visit other than a so-called wellness visit, the patient needs to pay just to get in the door (typically $85 just for the appointment). Or perhaps as an educated American physician you are simply ignorant of the real costs to patients when they come to see you. In my opinion it is obscene for educated physicians to criticize anyone but themselves for not vigorously and relentlessly working for universal health care coverage for all citizens. The doctor is actually making a good point. We pay cash for lawyers and dentists but expect insurance to cover all other costs. As a health care professionally I run into this all the time.But yes, universal healthcare is what we all should be working towards. Insurance companies have no business in health care. Take out the middleman.Nice reply.  There is a problem with our health care system and it’s me!! I am now $350,000 in debt and pay $3,500 per month for the next 16 years of my life with a repayment of about $672,000 just because I wanted to help people.  I am the one to blame, no one else for my altruisting thinking–The only way to make a difference is BE the difference.  I take full responsibility for being ignorant and now stupid for becoming part of “The System.”The system is broken, you are to be commended on doing an honorable job. Can’t we take the best of the Canadian system and improve it? I was born and raised in Canada, my parents and extended family still live there, and we all had good care. In rural areas Drs are lacking, but not in metropolitan areas, and yes you may have to wait for a non emergency procedure, but you still have the option to go to a private clinic. And if you do get sick, you don’t lose your home! Let’s start thinking about the people we live with as WE, not ME! Quote greenleaf: “In my opinion it is obscene for educated physicians to criticize anyone but themselves for not vigorously and relentlessly working for universal health care coverage for all citizens.”Who would then take care of the sick people? It’s the indeterminate wait in the waiting room I cannot afford.  All my dentists have seen me on time.HemoDynamic: I have long been wanting to reply to your posts and now seems like a good time.  I am someone who has grown frustrated and distrustful in general of physicians.  However, when I come to this site and see doctors like you, who actually take the time to educate yourself about real health solutions, I take heart.  I want a doctor just like you.  I hope you know that not all patients are dunderheads.  Hopefully you can get to a point in your career where you can find some good ones.Thank you for your enthusiastic participation on this website.  I know that I’m not the only one who appreciates it!Thank you for your kind comments.  I have a thriving practice full of people who want to get better and surprizingly (not really) they do! I know that you can look for Doctors that follow a plant based approach/philosophy on Dr. John McDougalls website at http://www.drmcdougall.com and maybe you can find one in your area. Thanks again.HemoDynamo, you yourself complained that patients do not want to pay you. Your own words: everyday I get patients coming in saying they went to their pharmacist to see what they could take for their symptoms.  (They go to the pharmacist because they did not want to “bother” ME (pay) for an office visit–Pharmacists are FREE!!). This is idiotic and shows ignorance. The reality is that going to see a doctor is impossible for many people. They cannot afford it. Even people who scrimp and save to buy health insurance wind up paying such costly premiums that they cannot afford to see a doctor when they are feeling ill or have symptoms. You do not seem to be aware of this. Someone commented that we pay lawyers and other professionals high prices and should therefore not complain about the cost of medical care (or words to that effect). But again, many people can’t afford those services at all and so do not get them when they are crucially needed. I say let’s question the high cost of professional care across the board. Why should anyone, the employed, the unemployed, the underemployed, pay such high costs? If medical school is so expensive, let’s make it less expensive. Isn’t that a better option to work toward?Funny Dr. Hana (Montana)!  Let me quote U: “This is idiotic and shows ignorance.”  Idiotic means stupid which is not ignorance.  Ignorant means basically Not Knowing. The definition: 1.Lacking knowledge or awareness in general; uneducated or unsophisticated.2. Lacking knowledge, information, or awareness about something in particular: “ignorant of astronomy”.Stupidity definition means slow of mind. So which is it?  Or are U just ignorant?Montana, I wrote “idiotic and shows ignorance.” It is both idiotic AND ignorant. In fact ignorant people may well also be stupid people. The two categories are not mutually exclusive. Consider critiquing your own posting. In my opinion it is both ignorant and nasty. You have nothing better to post? This is the best you can do?As a hospital pharmacist, I don’t always talk to patients, but do get the occasional caller from the community.  Yes, they do want FREE advice, as we are America’s most accessible health professional.   l  have ALWAYS referred patients to a physician when necessary, and it usually is. I hear a lot of raw foodists/fruitarians talk about adrenal exhaustion – it seems to be the ‘go to’ explanation for everything, but I can’t find any proper medical literature covering this. Is this just a fictitious disease?I work with people in the raw food scene too and yes they talk about adrenal fatigue a lot. I really don’t know how they can accurately diagnose anything, but usually it’s people that claim they used to drink a lot of coffee/red bull/eat chocolate/cacao/maca frequently every day that say they have/had adrenal fatigue from too many stimulants. I have never had it, but I’ve also never drank coffee nor do I eat stimulating supplements regularly. I’d be interested to know how people can actually get tested if they have adrenal fatigue. Raw foodists also say everyone has candida overgrowth (may be true only if you took tons of antibiotics in your life) and thyroid problems which is tricky to prove true based on listening to symptoms alone. quote Veronica: “I really don’t know how they can accurately diagnose anything”My feelings exactly!   There are tests to evaluate for adrenal insufficiency and thyroid dysfunction and they are not that expensive. A Basic metabolic panel (BMP) can test for electrolyte abnormalities that are frequently seen in adrenal abnormalities and also a Cosyntropin test, and a Thyrotropin Stimulating Hormone (TSH) for a basic check on thyroid function.  However, since people without Medical Degrees cannot order these tests and to stop the guessing/theoretical game it is best to see a qualified physician (or PA or NP <–that comment will get some people goin') to be evaluated and have the proper tests ordered.Poor HemoDynamic, all that debt and so few patients, all that time on this forum spent on your own self-promotion. You seem to have an inordinate amount of free time for a physician. You might want to spend just a little of it thinking about why patients avoid coming to you. After reading your postings, I doubt that it is the cost. You appear to be using this forum to get patients. Please do go elsewhere.   Sorry you don’t enjoy HemoDynamic’s insightful and erudite comments, Hana. I’m sure you’re in a minority.I’m sorry you feel that way! I have never once promoted myself nor given any information as to where I practice; hence, using a pseudonym.  My time on this forum has been spent in between my patients (I see avg. 20-25 per day) in trying to help and inform patients. I apologise that this is offensive to you. HemoDynamic, let’s face it, your comments are self-promotional. You have a glossy promotional head shot of yourself that shows with every one of your nonstop comments, you use a dynamic-sounding pseudonym along with the glam photo, you are always the hero of your own story while others are uneducated idiots or unappreciative of your selfless dedication, and perhaps worst of all, you free ride on the reputation of Dr. Greger, who has a genuine and impeccable record of public service. I think the people who might find you most offensive are your own patients, who get the shortest possible time with you so that you can rush to promote yourself in this forum. I think good physicians spend time in between seeing patients thinking about and researching the unique issues that present with each patient. I’m sorry you are such an angry person. Hana, I don’t know what your problem is, but I’m getting sick of it. I wish you’ d crawl back into the hole you came from – and I think I speak for the majority of readers of this blog. If you had any sense you would realize not only how helpful HemoDynamic’s comments are, how they have the ring of authenticity and sincerity, and that he can’t possibly be self-promoting since he is offering his services as a physician only in his local area and not to the world-wide community which reads this blog. You make about as much sense ans a screen door on a submarine. Speaking of pseudonyms, I’d be willing to bet that the “Dr.” in yours is bogus.Do you believe your comment is useful to this forum? I am a PhD and a researcher.  If Dr. HemoDynamo sees 20-25 patients a day, that is already too little time spent with the patient. If while examining them his mind is on his postings to this forum, then they are even more neglected. It’s all about the patient. Aaaaaah a PhD and a researcher! That explains the arrogance!!! Thanks for clearing that up, it makes perfect sense!! (no disrespect to the non-arrogant PhD researchers who actually have personalities and people skills)I completely agree with Paul 3917. Chill Hana.I have really appreciated Hemodynamics comments. Keep them coming!I am sure HemoDynamo will keep his comments coming without your urging! I have no problem with his postings that provide useful information to the public. My critique was in response to HemoDynamo’s complaint that so many patients go elsewhere rather than to him and that their stupidity in that regard was incomprehensible since the cost to the patient is only a $20 copay. He needs to understand the real cost to patients and why they pay such a high price. I’m certain that he does, so I don’t understand why he would make such a disingenuous comment in the first place. I also critiqued him for using this forum to gripe about the costs of medical school. As he well knows, most of the high cost of medical education trickles down to the patient, or as they are now called, the consumer or customer, who are wisely fleeing a dysfunctional system. It is they, not the physician, who ultimately pays the price. The vast majority of physicians in this country are economically in the middle upper classes and are among the elite who can afford to live in the better neighborhoods and send their children to good schools and the best universities. So it is inexcusable for HemoDynamo to use this forum to complain about his financial situation.  The fact that a growing number of people are dissatisfied with the ever deteriorating medical services they pay such a high price for and wisely seek help elsewhere  is to their credit. As HemoDynamo must also know, while many physicians pay lip service to wanting universal health coverage, the vast majority have no intention of ever doing anything to make sure Americans get it.  They would rather preserve a dysfunctional health care system that does not serve the public well rather than make a more modest income. HemoDynamo, don’t dish it if you can’t take it. Common sense shows this study merely proves people should do their own homework on what type of supplements they need. The bottom line is neither pharmacist nor health food store employees know much about what supplements to recommend. (For the most part anyway)Most pharmacists look to high quality resources such as the available medical literature to obtain information about supplements.  Unfortunately, I find that many laypeople who try to “do their own homework” are duped by snake oil salesmen into ingesting potential dangerous or worthless products.  If they did their “homework” on this website, though, I completely agree with you!Pharmacists have expertise in evidence-based medicine. I’m surprised this study was even done. Who would bother to compare the nutritional advice provided by a fast food employee to that of a PhD in nutrition?It is unfortunate to read some comments devaluing pharmacy services. Pharmacists have advanced training, usually doctorate degrees and often additional residency and followship experience.  Many pharmacists collaborate with busy physicians in outpatient clinics assisting with cleaning up messy medication profiles, doing quality and medication safety improvement, reducing polypharmacy, avoiding drug interactions, managing high risk medications (e.g., warfarin, insulin), and providing disease state education.  Some states including North Carolina recognize pharmacists as Clinical Pharmacist Practitioners, licensed to prescribe medications and manage certain diseases in collaboration with physicians. Countless studies demonstrate improved health outcomes, reduced adverse drug reactions, and decreased overall health care expenditure by having a pharmacist on the inpatient or outpatient health care team.Any advice on healing adrenal exhaustion on a vegan diet?

The problem with vitamins is that companies are trying to find one, or a few nutrients that provide our bodies with health and longevity. What keeps people healthy in real life however, is eating Vegetables, fruits, beans and grains because they have so many important nutrients that work together and help cells protect each other from free radical damage. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lutein-lycopene-and-selenium-pills/http://nutritionfacts.org/video/produce-not-pills-to-increase-physical-attractiveness/ In addition, there are many things in meat and dairy that increase the risk for many diseases. No vitamin can extract unwanted hormones, saturated fat, viruses/bacteria, etc.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-is-a-package-deal-3/Dr Greger does have this video – http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-supplements-worth-taking/In a nutshell, Vitamin D and B-12 are key.  It’s also generally accepted taking a DHA supplement is wise (I use Udo’s Oil DHA blend in smoothies, or Opti3 Omega for other days.)  Depending on the quality of your diet, you may want to look out for your iron, zinc, calcium and iodine.Based on Dr Greger’s recommendation, I am also reading the excellent ‘Vegan For Life’ (http://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Life-Everything-Healthy-Plant-Based/dp/0738214930) which I’ve found a great resource, furthering my understanding. I know the supplement and pharmaceutical industry have already and will be coming up with “tailored” supplements targeting specific conditions. For eye diseases see… http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-macular-degeneration-with-diet/ for a discussion of specific eye conditions. However, unless I see clear cut long term proper studies I won’t be able to recommend isolated supplements to patients however see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-vitamin-supplements/ plus the over 70 videos that Dr. Greger has done on supplements. The bulk of data suggest that “isolated” nutrients are not beneficial and are in fact harmful for Vitamins A, E and antioxidant beta carotene as the studies point out. The best approach to avoiding chronic disease in general is a variety of whole plant based foods with Vitamin B12 supplement. So patients who either have a condition or want to avoid a condition can emphasize the types of food supported by the studies. It is always better to avoid a condition (primary prevention) then attempt to reverse and cure (secondary prevention). Of course the science keeps changing and reminding us of how little we understand.  A good example is AGE’s see the two videos showing how we can miss opportunities with assumptions based on animal studies see the two videos http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/advanced-glycation-end-products/ and http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-a-sugary-grave/. Good luck.After following the Budwig Protocol (3 tblspns flaxseed oil blended with 6 tblspns organic low fat cottage cheese, with 1 tblspn freshly ground flaxseeds and fruit every morning) for about two years, my ophthamalogist took me off my glaucoma eye drop prescription saying “things look well stabilized, so let’s try without the medicine.” I had been taking prescriptive eye drops for glaucoma for more than 20 years, but now I don’t need medicine any longer. I take flaxseed oil, cottage cheese, and ground flaxseeds every day.Just finished a biography about Nathan Pritikin (with mention in the book of course of one Frances Greger) called “Nathan Pritikin: The Man Who Healed America’s Heart.” I found it to be a fascinating and inspiring read with mention of all kinds of interesting studies. Unfortunately, there were no references for these studies in the back of the book. One study mentioned was the auditory acuity maintained by the Mabaan tribe in Sudan. Even the older tribespeople enjoy hearing superior to most younger Americans. Not being subjected to the noises of modern technology is probably beneficial for the Mabaan, but apparently atherosclerosis of the organs of hearing is a strong determinant of presbycusis in western societies.  Since the book didn’t mention the diet of the Mabaan, I did a little research. I believe this is the study: Ann. Otol. Rhin & Laryng. 71:727, 1962. To quote from the study: “The results clearly indicate that presbycusis is not inevitable. However, the Mabaan population differs from ours in may ways besides the noise environment: they eat little animal protein, there is no obesity and little dental caries, and average blood pressure does not increase with age.” Oh I’d love to read it! I see this one: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14169751 but not the one you mention. Could you email me the PDF or full citation? mhg1@cornell.edu–thank you!If you are already developing cataracts not yet in need pf surgery – can you slow or reverse by adopting healthy vegan diet?Three years ago I was diagnosed with cataracts (beginning stage…yellow tinted fluid in eyes). A second eye doctor confirmed the diagnoses. Both said I would be sightless in two years. Today my vision is still 20/15 corrected with contact lenses since age sixteen. How can the two doctors be so wrong?A year prior to the diagnosis I started taking a 5% Lugol’s Iodine Solution supplement. Could the iodine possibly have tinted my eye fluid like it does microscope slides?Cataracts are opacities in the lens not the fluid in the eye. I’m glad to hear that your physicians were wrong. It is clear that cataracts are less prevalent in groups eating a more plant based diet as pointed out in the article cited in this video. Once they have formed reversing the condition has not been shown. Fortunately surgical treatment of cataracts is one of the most successful and rewarding(for patients) who need the procedure. If you want to protect your vision plant based diet is the way to go although some foods seem to be better than others.. see video on macular degeneration… http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-macular-degeneration-with-diet/ and glaucoma… http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/… and diabetic retinopathy… http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/. The science keeps building up to support a plant based diet with Vit B12 supplementation but you need to keep tuned to NutritionFacts.org as the science keeps coming… Good luck.One other unrelated comment, two internet posters both insist their eye color changed after switching to a vegan diet. Both claim they are healthy and have no eye problems. Is there any truth to the claim eyes can change color after switching to a plant based diet?I shouldn’t be getting cataracts but my opthamologist says I’ll get them.Excellent!What was the length of time the vegans were vegan?It would be helpful to know this for all videos and reports even if it is an average or approximate.It would also be interesting to know if switching from a meat/fish diet to a vegetarian or vegan diet reverses the damage.This is obviously anecdotal, but I had cataracts for over ten years though they were not prominent enough to be bothersome. I started on a WFPB diet over two years ago, and a couple o f months ago the cataracts in my right eye had become problematic enough to warrant surgery last week. So at least in my case, there was no reversal of my cataracts—and even continued progression of them.Thank you for making so much material available to read. It really is a great help for a man living in Germanys north west were a lot of pig eating goes on. Makes things tough when invited to a party. I can actually see the illness in most age groups here due to there high intake of fats and meat. Funny how the truth is staring is in the face but nobody wants to hear about it.Keep up the great work.Michael DolanMichael: I like getting a peak into the situations in other countries. So, thanks for this post.re: “Makes things tough when invited to a party.” I fully understand this. Some human cultures have gotten to the point where social life becomes difficult just because you want to eat healthy. It’s possible to go to parties and still live the way you know is best, but you have to work a lot harder at it. You are not alone.I have recently come across an article that suggests a high carbohydrate diet is linked to cataract formation. (Chung-Jung Chiu, et al, “Dietary carbohydrate intake and glycemic index in relation to cortical and nuclear lens opacities in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study, The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2006; 83: 1777-1784) Have you reviewed this and is it a valid study? Is it really necessary to start counting the glycemic rating of all my plant-based foods? Thanks.Is there ever an urgency to perform cataract surgery? If not, giving a plant based diet a shot is something one could experiment with themselves on a singular trial basis, it seems that going vegan would not hurt and potentially could benefit someone who end up with the surgery if they did nothing. Surgical outcomes have got to be better for those who are plant based eaters vs SAD dieters who often get diabetes. My father-in-law had this surgery performed and his outcome has been worse than if he had not ever had it done.All plants contain distilled water, I think people need to start drinking distilled water as well, as all other sources are damaging to the body. There are organic and inorganic minerals the inorganic minerals are no good for the body. Organic minerals are in plants!I believe it’s these inorganic minerals building up in the body that’s leading cause in glaucoma , arthritis, gout and many other diseases!but dr. greger, i have been a vegetarian since 1984 and vegan since 2002. what do i do now that i’m starting to get cataracts? why did this happen?I had understood that it was the amount of fats and oils in the diet that contributed to the opacification of the lens of the eye. That reducing these in the diet will halt the progression of cataracts but not undo the damage all ready there.I had understood that it was the amount of fats and oils in the diet that contributed to the opacification of the lens of the eye.

Nothing like the gross-factor to convince people to change. Keep up yoour great work!!!!!Just a note:  I was at the store the other day and my 12 year old son said, “Dad want some mites?” while pointing at the cheese.  I had to chuckle. Because of this video my son has since convinced two of his friends to go Vegan.  In fact, he went to a Birthday Party yesterday at one of those friends house and everything was Vegan!!  Life’s little triumphs! Keep it up Michael!!!!!!Wow, there’re no limits to what people do to food.So the real question is *how many* cheese manufacturers add these insects to their cheese? Saying “some” do is leaving a pretty wide latitude. It could be 1/10 of 1 percent or 99%. I have been an ovo-lacto vegetarian since I was 16 (I’m 61 now) and would like to move towards being vegan. This will definitely help if these practices are widespread.PETA’s “Got Pus” campaign got me off cow’s milk lickety-split. Should I assume the percentages of cheese manufacturers doing this is high?Go vegan already, Ann. Who cares if cheese has insects in it or not? Cheese contains the stomach pieces of baby calves so technically, you’re not really a vegetarian.I think these links will help you give up eggs and cheese:Why vegans do not eat eggs: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ–faib7to The video above is NOT a cleverly edited video; it is standard procedure they really don’t want us to know that now, some states are trying to make recording undercover videos like this illegal (“AG-GAG bill”); it’s already illegal in 5 states (Iowa, Utah, Kansas, North Dakota, Montana): http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2012/03/five-states-now-have-ag-gag-laws-on-the-books/ Why vegans do not eat cheese: http://www.thisveganlife.org/i-couldnt-give-up-cheese-so-i-gave-up-animal-cruelty-instead Why vegans do not consume even “cage-free” eggs and “humane/organic” milk/dairy products: http://www.humanemyth.org Almost no mainstream cheeses still use natural rennet. Out of everything Tilamook makes, for example, there are two that use calf stomach rennet. Also, don’t be a dick about people’s dietary choices.plenty of other reasons to quit, yes?W O W …positively disgusting!! …and perhaps just what I needed to kick my (minimal, thankfully) cheese consumption. Thanks!I guess Pizza Hut will not be using this information in their commercials.Leaping maggots!Sure, this is gross, but the really disgusting thing about it is it is made with the milk of another species, from a mother who has been impregnated and had her baby taken and killed so we can use the mothers’s milk. Now that is disgusting!Not to mention, it contains the stomach pieces of baby calves. Vile in every which way:http://www.thisveganlife.org/i-couldnt-give-up-cheese-so-i-gave-up-animal-cruelty-instead  Love all the information on the site, but I have to say this is the first one lost on me – and credibility is everything.  So what does bugs used in cheese have to do with nutrition??  Is there a point that there is some negtive health outcome (and as others have asked, is it even commonly used? – doesn’t sound like it), or is this just to make cheese seem icky because, oh no, it might have a bug in it??Did you not listen to the whole clip?The video did say the medical problem cheese eaters may suffer is dermatitis.  I’ve got that condition and it is not a minor problem for many people. I would also like to know how widespread this practice of adding mites is, the video leaves that question open and I feel like it would be more powerful if that were made clear. Leaping Maggots Berryman!  That the Dairy industry has done this practice even once should convince you that the only thing they care about is marketability, which leads to profitability.  If crap made cheese taste better they would for sure add it.  They could care less about your health! Watch this video about the USDA and how much they DON’T care about you and your health:  http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-science-versus-corporate-interests/They COULDN’T care less. Seriously, the bottom line for everything is money. They couldn’t care less about your health, nor your children, nor the environment, nor the fact that you’re eating bugs you don’t know about…and apparently, most people would prefer to be in the dark because it’s inconvenient to know the truth. Imagine how inconvenient it is for the animals who live the dairy/meat industry horrors every moment of every day. I couldn’t agree more!It’s super uncommon. If you’re buying cheese from large producers you will never be exposed to it. The practice of adding mites is only used in the production of two very specific cheese, Mimolette and Milbenkase. The presence of cheese mites can happen in some small batch, artisan, aged cheeses but is considered a production flaw and is quickly and easily identified by a distinctive dusty rind. Any reputable cheesemonger will be able to identify the problem and will refuse delivery of the cheese.Agree, if you know anything about cheese, as you obviously do, you will know it is not widespread nor done in very commercial brand cheeses. Bugs are everywhere, mites are on your skin, bugs and mites crawl all over the plants vegans eat too. If you took a microscopic look at everything in this world you would freak out and and cease to function, but everything has to be put in proper perspective. I don’t like fear and gross out tactics to push a food choice stance.The only concern with the mites is that of dermatitis, a common skin reaction to those with mite allergies. The practice of adding mites is only used in the production of two VERY specific cheeses, Mimolette and Milbenkase and the mites are long dead by the time the cheese is distributed.Um, to me the issue is… it happens, and we eat…some of us are BUGGED by certain issues and appreciate the info! Yet one more reason to leave animal products out of our diets. If you don’t want to deal with it, fine, but how is this not “credible”?I agree, it’s not complete enough information and seems to favor the side of using fear and gross out tactics to get people to go vegan.Feels good to be vegan! How’s those maggots and pus and blood and estrogen and mites and damn – GO VEGAN!plenty of plants have estrogen like compounds, soy is full of them. Too much soy will also slow down your thyroid to a slow crawl.Who cut the cheese,,,,gross plusOy.  This adds a whole new level to what I call “glatt treif”, incredibly non-kosher. Between this and Starbucks owing up to using cochineal to color some of their products you wonder what else is “buggy” out there.After “The Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes” we’re probably looking at the “Attack Of The Leaping Cheese Maggots”!I am a bugatarian. I don’t eat animals or fish. I eat a lot of vegetables like grass and when I can get them….BUGS!You forgot something Doc. You said nothing about the nutrition benefits of maggots. Well, are they good or or they bad for me? I am a goose. Maybe they are OK for humans too?Oh good lord. I’ve still been dabbling a bit with cheese but this has put the last nail in.The process of using cheese mites is used only for very specific cheeses, Mimolette and Milbernkase, and is considered a flaw in the production of any other cheese. The mites are long dead and gone when the cheese is consumed and the health risk is less than the risk you take sleeping on your own mattress where you’re exposed to far greater quantities of mites and is only relevant at all to those suffering from mite allergies. Casu Marzu, the maggot cheese, is more of a strange novelty than a staple foodstuff and the health risks are so obvious that it’s really only enjoyed by the most extreme gastronomes. Gross, yes, but it’s a strange, regional, traditional practice, not a standard industry practice and the avoidance of all cheese due to these two ridiculously specific processes, neither of which occur in the US, is just absurd.As for the rennet discussion in the posts above, remember that many cheeses are made with vegetable enzymes in place of traditional animal rennet.Many? How many? As you criticized the doc, can you please specify the number? Doesn’t seem like many as calf rennet is so redily available thanks to all the dairy farms which lead to veal factories. And what about the blood, pus and leukemia virus in the milk?Casomorphin? Or cancer promoting proteins? Thanks but no thanks, more points against eating the curdled fat from mammalian milk that for it in my humble opinion.

Let’s not forget replacement or surgically altered contours are not better than Nature’s original…….let alone the cost and associated surgical complications.The health perhaps of our intervertebral discs and the cartilage lining the knees, hip and shoulder joints would all seem to benefit from improved widened and clear arteries. How could they not?In short, just another good reason to follow a low-fat vegan diet. Thank you!Thank you for your informative videos. I really enjoy the human body vascular system visual you used in the last few videos in order to show the connection between all these diseases of poor circulation (heart disease, erectile dysfunction, degenerative disk disease). I know your grandmother had intermittent claudication and got better very quickly on the Pritikin diet. Would it be possible for you to do a short 1-2 minute video on intermittent claudication and how quickly it can be reversed on a plant-based diet? I have a few family members who could benefit from such a video. Similarly, the visual concept could be extended to discuss other serious diseases associated with poor circulation like macular degeneration, hearing loss, periodontitis, aortic aneurysm, bowel infarction, kidney failure, and gangrene.Thank you for making all of this information available in such a concise format.

You deserve an award.Frank: Awesome story. Keep up the good work. Thanks for taking the time to share your story with us. I LOVE these stories.Is the plaque build up reversible?Indeed it is, restoring arterial health can clean up the plaque completely.Looking into nutrition for resolving back pain is like looking into the cavemen diet for resolving the coronary artery disease. If you study the work of Prof. Dr. McGill (e.g. Low Back Disorders, Evidence-Based Prevention and Rehabilitation) you will see that nearly ALL cases of back pain are due to mechanical factors. But, of course, at first this might be hard to believe because the industry says otherwise – but once you look at the RESEARCH (where load bearing and injury mechanisms are actually MEASURED and not just totally and 100% ignored) you will understand.having that statement out of the way, I find a link between diet and atherosclerosis and back pain refreshing and interesting, but as a high-carb vegan and follower of Dr. Greger’s advice not surprising.Dr Gregor!I went vegan 6 months ago after being in so much back pain (2 slipped disks), where no physiotherapist that i saw could fix it. It was horrible and debilitating. 2 days after eating so many fruits and vegetables and getting rid of animal products i had no pain.. even to the point where i could swim, cycle and run again at a very fast pace. Since then i got back into exercise and it has been great. Until last week i noticed i was eating less and sleeping less due to exams at university and the pain came back. Then once again i upped my caloric intake of fruits, vegetables and grains and the pain just goes away! I find it so astonishing! The strange thing was that the pain that came back was just as chronic as it was before. Im 27 year old female. Anyway just thought i would share because everyone thinks I’m crazy that i healed my body with a plant based diet and they think it was just the placebo effect!Keep doing what your doing Dr Gregor because you are helping make a huge impact on people!! <3Good Morning Mister Gregor and Team, I have a generally understanding question. Like we known is the Cholesterol responsible for the Plaque in the Arteries (simple spoken). Here in Germany is the blood test ok, if the Cholesterol is between 150 – 200 mg/dl. Most of physicians and normal people believe than, that they are save for plaque in there Arteries. At China Study of Mister Champbell I read, that the generally measured part of Bloodcholesterol by Chinese has been enormously under them of the western world. And you mention in a video, according to a study, that a lots of young people under 20 already developed arteriosclerosis (at leased has been plaque seen). Now my question – is it wrong when I made the conclusion that also a man oder a women can develop low back pain as a early stadium of bad supply of there discs because the start to develop a arteriosclerosis, despite they have a measured cholesterol between 150 to 200 mg/dl bloodcholesterol? Or is this thinking totally out of way?Steffen, I know that many medical establishments say that a total cholesterol between 150 and 200 is OK. But Dr. Esselstyn (in his book, Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease – as well as some free videos on the web) says that the ideal is to get under 150 total (and under 70 LDL). Dr. Greger also has a videos and articles about the “magic” 150/70 numbers. Here is one such video: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/ Bottom line is: a total cholesterol over 150 is still too high.So, I’m thinking that yes, someone could have a total cholesterol between 150 and 200 and have lower back pain due to problems with blood circulation/heart disease. But I don’t know if this is true for any particular person/situation. And I’m not an expert.

I take that as meaning he will address that issue over the course of the next week.It does appear to contradict all of the common risk factors, though. “Low fiber, high fat diets. Sedentary lifestyle. Obesity. Diabetes. Smoking, and alcohol consumption” are a number of risk factors provided by the Mayo Clinic that usually aren’t attributes of vegetarians. Old age is a risk factor, perhaps mean age was higher for the vegetarian participants? Perhaps the excessive low calorie handicap (just as much fruits/veggies as omnivores) played a role. Inflammatory bowel diseases are a risk factor, which could be related to grain consumption in the vegetarian group assuming they had a gluten intolerance or celiac, diagnosed or not.

It does so much to clarify the raw food movement and also finds a way to allow me to eat cooked broccoli and still fight cancer.I was starting to get a sick feeling in my stomach at the beginning. Was I going to have to find a way to eat broccoli raw? Please, say it isn’t so! I have enough food challenges as it is. Thankfully, not only do I have a maximum-healthy way to eat cooked broccoli, but I can justify all those packages of pre-chopped (organic) broccoli that I buy from Trader Joes. Yeah!Love that book “Becoming Raw”. Tim VanOrden is the only other super down to earth raw foodist (that I know of) that talked about the “enzyme myth”. He talked a lot about AGE’s and PAH’s (when cooked) and how a lot of the benefit was what we avoided when eating raw food. And it was one of his videos that got me to try frozen broccoli in smoothies! With bananas & mangos & now a teaspoon of Amla, it’s truly superfood. I also love that in the “Becoming Raw” book, it talks about iodine, seaweed and contaminants. My takeaway was buy good brands that test for metals & don’t ever eat hijki!Good to know. My husband Frederic Patenaude actually wrote a book called Raw Food Controversies, lol. Although we promote a high raw diet we never used the enzyme theory as a reason to only eat 100% raw foods as you miss out on so many healthy vegetables and greens most people don’t want to eat raw.So I teach people how to eat more raw food and healthy oil free vegan foods at http://www.LowFatVeganChef.comLove your work Michael, we saw you speak at the Advanced 3 Day Weekend and got all of your Nutrition Facts DVDs. :) Science rules!Regarding cooked vs raw, although it is not the same nutrient under discussion, is it not the case that this clip and the one at http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/raw-vs-cooked-broccoli-2/ contradict one another? That being so, it would appear that the best way to eat broccoli is by using the chopped-then-cooked method.Because: either etaing raw, or eeating directly cooked is going to result in the non-availability of one thing or another.Or just get your fix of sulforaphane from broccoli sprouts and steam away without worrying about how you chop or when you cook!And what is the optimal degree of choppédness of the broccoli? In the country where I live there is no such thing as store-bought frozen pre-chopped broccoli, so I’ve never seen it, but I would imagine that where it does exist, it is simply individual florets — not terribly small ones at that– cut off of the stalk. Is that all the choppédness required? That would not be much, and it is difficult to imagine it having much effect.I have a great method that I didn’t realize was doing me such a great favor, I buy fresh dandelion greens, watercress and fresh bulk broccoli/purple or yellow cauliflower, I then put the broccoli/cauliflower in a freezer bag and the other two in a freezer bag and freeze them overnight. The next day I pound each bag with a 3 pound hammer until they are powdered. Then I just add them to my morning Vitamix green smoothies or use them to make stews at night. It works great! However, On a different topic where I don’t feel that I’ve done well, I recently saw a video by Jeff Novick on YouTube (http://bit.ly/GE7Wef) (Go to the 10:29 mark to save time) where he points out a study that dispels the notion that fiber will fill you up a greatly suppressing any cravings that you would otherwise have. Fiber in its natural form is different than a blended form, as you will see in the video. My question on that though is this, aren’t we suppose to chew are food until it is liquid? Isn’t that the same as blending? JayHi Dr. Greger.Interesting information. I wish you would have presented it in a different way. I’m concerned it will encourage some people with wacky raw foodism beliefs. No disrespect to you or anyone else.Dr. Greger, how do you steam foods in a glass pot? Our steamers are all Revereware stainless steel that fit into Revereware stainless steel pots. We do have some Corningware pots but none have steamers with them.After you mentioned Brenda Davis’ BECOMING RAW in this video, I bought a copy and have reached page 56, where Vitamin E is discussed. Davis says, “An unexpected finding was that metal containers may interact with Vitamin E to increase its losses. For example, peas steamed in a metal pot had vitamin-E losses of up to 70 percent compared to no losses when a glass pot was used.” (Chapter 4 footnote 105)Puzzled and hoping to retain Vitamin E in our steamed (or simmered or boiled, which weren’t mentioned) foods, I’m considering what we might need to change in our cooking procedures. Two containers are involved for steaming, the lower one holding liquid (which we keep and use afterward for cooking rice or quinoa or soup or oatmeal), and the perforated container which holds food above the simmering liquid. There’s also a metal lid that gathers condensation which is returned through the food and perforated container to the lower container.I’m wondering if using steel cooking pots and pans negatively affects the quality of other nutrients, as well. If so, is that significant? The Vitamin E losses sounded significant. What kind of containers should we be using for cooking?I am perplexed.Thank you!I know nothing of the chemistry you’re concerned about, but you might want to try a bamboo steamer with your Corningware pots. A bamboo steamer rests on top of a pot and doesn’t need an exact fit to work well.Great information. I happen to have the Davis and Melina book, “Becoming Raw”. It’s indeed a great and sound book.Dr. Greger, I thought I heard 40 minutes in the video – is there any good data on how long to wait after chopping for maximum sulforaphane content?Michael, perhaps you could do a blog on juicing and its purported benefits regarding more enzymes released into the blood stream.  Talk about whether we don’t need the fiber from foods juiced etc. Also, what enzymes are in our gut and if they are really diluted through drinking water with a meal.Dr. Greger covers juicing here http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fruit-juice-fail/For some context, please check out my associated blog post The Best Detox!What about this article?http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942204001657Sulphorophane, what makes broccoli so great, is increased with cooking as your article points out.Would you consider 60 C cooking? That’s like 140 degrees Fahrenheit.No I wouldn’t! I didnt realize the temps were so low, i quickly skimmed the abstract in this situation. Thanks for pointing that our Dr. G!Thank you so much, Dr.Greger, for all the time and effort you put into making your videos! They are highly infomative and interestingly done too! Regarding sulphoraphane, I understand that broccoli sprouts have about 40 times more than broccoli florets, and they are very edible raw. Thought this might be helpful too, for those interested in this topic.So what is the 2nd example of a plant enzyme that serves a physiological function? (You mention there are 2 at the onset of the video)My guess is that it’s the allinase in allium vegetables, which turns the inactive alliin compounds into active forms of sulphur. Am I right?You.re righyWhat about mixing some raw broccoli with the salad, assuming that you would in any case be having some salad? Would that not assist the cooked broccoli in energising the gut actions?Are you certain that the glucosinolates in cut broccoli last a long time?Do you get the sulforaphane when making a raw juice with broccoli or it has to be chewed to get the benefitJuicing is essentially the same function as chopping/cutting the broccoli, so as long as you’re juicing it raw, you should be unleashing even more sulforaphane by juicing it.Would you mind giving us the source of your statement that cutting broccoli and letting it sit 40 minutes allows the enzymes to produce healthy glucosinolates that are not later destroyed by cooking?Harriet, Did you ever receive the info on the sources/ scientific studies/ you requested here? best, BRJNo, I never got a response other than “Dr. Greger suggests” doing this. I know there’s research on alliums suggesting you need to cut them and let them sit but I haven’t seen any research on crucifers. It would make sense though. I’m going to ask a crucifer researcher what she thinks.Harriet Sugar Miller, Noticed your query in the feed this morning. I believe the references you’re looking for are linked in the sources cited section of this video: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/second-strategy-to-cooking-broccoli/Hope that helps.I communicated today with the food scientist who discovered the value of combining raw and cooked crucifers, and she says that no, you do not need to cut crucifers and let them sit. You just need to chew them well in order to activate the myrosinase. http://zesterdaily.com/cooking/how-to-prepare-broccoli-to-fight-cancer/And somewhere in this mass of interesting work, you state that indoles in crucifers increase with cooking? What’s the source of that statement?It’s really too bad broccoli give me a lot of gas, especially raw broccoli.What, I wonder, sulforafane-wise, is the effect of pickling vej, by salt, or koji?I have been on a whole food plant based diet for the last 2 years. Over the last 2 years, I have experienced some bouts of afib. Over the last month, I have changed to predominantly raw food. Since my change, I have not had any fluttering at all. Why? Can you explain that if its not the raw diet, then what? Nothing else has changed.I have read that nuts and seeds contain enzyme inhibitors and therefore require soaking and slow drying before consumption. Is this correct.

This video is the second to last video in my 3-week series that started with Doping With Beet Juice and will end tomorrow with a video entitled “So should we drink beet juice or not?” Thanks for sticking it out with me! Now you just have another 1500 or so other topics to enjoy.Is it just animal fat that inhibits the protective Vitamin C, or does cooking high-nitrate veggies with oils or eating them with nuts, avocado, etc. cause the same problem?It’s easy to get confused between nitrites and nitrates (and all the more confusing, probably, seeing only 2 minutes or so of the story every day)! If, however, you go back and watch this series through, you’ll note that it’s the nitrites (with an “i”) that turn into carcinogens (a process that is blocked by phytonutrients in the absence of fat). Nitrites enter your body two ways, through processed meats directly when you eat them (and so the fat in the meat undermines any phytonutrients added to the meat) or hours after you eat a meal of high nitrate (with an “a”) vegetables through bacterial action on your tongue (again it might be good to go back and review). So we need fat to maximize our absorption of the carotenoids in greens (so add some nuts or seeds to your salad) but then hours later once the nitrates make it back into the mouth and produce nitrites, that’s when we should have no fat in our stomach.Dr. Greger: I have a follow up question to your response to MacSmiley, namely:How can one ever time these digestive steps so accurately to ensure that there is “no fat in our stomach” when “the nitrates make it back into the mouth and produce nitrites”?Are you implying that after a meal containing nitrate rich plant products that we estimate the time it takes to reach our mouth and then never consume any fat at that time?This all sounds very difficult and prone to error!Ahhh. I just reviewed the video “Priming the Proton Pump”.The key is the fact that the bacteria on our tongues do not convert the nitrates into nitrites while we are initially chewing our nitrate-srich green leafies. Our bodies put the nitrates back into our mouths via our saliva later on hours post-mealtime! THAT’s when the nitrates get converted into nitrites, reabsorbed when we swallow our spit, and THEN converted into nitric oxide!!BRILLIANT!Now I can see that medications that cause “dry mouth” are affecting more than our oral health!Now it makes even more sense when Dr Fuhrman says not to snack on nuts between meals, but to eat them with meals, beyond initial nutrient absorption enhancement. That way there won’t be any fats in your stomach when the nitrates make there 2nd appearance.re: “Now it makes even more sense when Dr Fuhrman says not to snack on nuts between meals, but to eat them with meals…” MacSmiley: Thanks for this comment. Just the other day, someone was telling me that Dr Fuhrman says what you wrote right here. I didn’t say anything in response to this person, but I didn’t think much of the idea. It sounded kind of silly to me. But you pulled the ideas together. I’m not familiar with Dr. Fuhrman’s particular teachings. I have just heard the name often and had no idea why he would say such a thing. Thanks. :-)Dr Fuhrman is a colleague of Dr Greger. He is a board-certified family physician and author of several books, including Eat to Live, Eat for Health, and most recently, Super Immunity.His rationale for eating 3 large meals a day with no between meal snacks has more to do with breaking our great American constant-face-stuffing food addiction, the anabolic/catabolic digestion cycle, as well as recommending nuts/seeds/avocado be eaten WITH meals for greater nutrient absorption.What I meant to say is that this new information from Dr. Greger is just one more reason for me to stick to Dr Fuhrman’s commonsense Eat to Live recommendations.In fact Dr. Fuhrman recently interviewed me: http://www.diseaseproof.com/archives/interviews-features-dr-fuhrman-interviews-michael-greger-md.htmlIs it just me or is everyone else also getting a “Not Found” message when thr back up to watch older videos?I was able to view Priming the Proton Pump on the YouTube backup.http://youtu.be/4ivRY9YsdnYThanks Dr. Greger for this explanation. It helps a lot to get rid of the confusion!Now that So Should We Drink Beet Juice or Not? is posted I’m hoping that will help too! You can see why I had to make so many videos about it!re: “…that will help too! You can see why I had to make so many videos about it!” Yes, you really need the whole series to get an understanding. It is a complicated topic. (On the other hand, I cried fowl on the video that did nothing but ask whether or not bacon and veggies do the same thing. That video is only a question and no info! But I digress.)I’m fascinated by this stuff. And it is just one more important piece of information in that big picture of what it means to eat healthy.For what it is worth, here is some of my thoughts right now: I was thinking about the issue of “three hours later, best not to have fat in your tummy”. I tend to eat about every three hours or so throughout the day. So, perhaps I need to have my arugula salad as my last meal of the day?But if my nitrate/nitrite loading is at the end of the day, would I get any exercise-assistance benefits the next day? I’m not all that found of beets or arugula. So, I kind of want all the benefit I can get if I’m going to try to eat them. I’m not sure I remember the videos enough to say, but I’m guessing that I would miss out on the energy boost.So, then it would be matter of being thoughtful about when to have the arugula salad. Maybe I should have it in the morning (which would be very difficult for me since I’m now stuck on my yummy chocolate-banana oatmeal for breakfast) and just make sure that my mid-morning snacks and lunch are fat-free.Just thinking about things. It’s a lot to think about. I really appreciate the info.Although indeed all foods contain fat, perhaps if you ate a low fat meal 3 hours after consumption of nitrates you would be better off. I tend to eat large meals and stay full for long periods of time. I do snack on fruits though through out the day.re: “I tend to eat large meals and stay full for long periods of time.” I’m more of an all-day grazer myself. Though I found that the oatmeal happily keeps me pretty full for quite a while most days.“…then hours later once the nitrates make it back into the mouth and produce nitrites, that’s when we should have no fat in our stomach.”How about the protective phytonutrients then? Aren’t they also gone hours later?Do you recall that our stomach actively releases vitamin C to deal with this issue?I’m not very good at timing when I eat fats vs. veggies.  And I wondered if there was much fat timing in all the prior studies out there where the higher intake of fruits and vegetables (traditional Mediterranean diet, DASH diet) were associated with healthy benefits. Having chronic health issues I am familiar with PubMed, the online source of studies, and so went there to see if I could find some additional information. It turns out that the lead author for the study cited in this video has since published two more studies.   One study indicates that the type of fat the nitrates encounter affects the outcome. Unsaturated fats actually act as scavengers of some nitrosating species. His other study found that different types of acids present in plants have different effects on nitrosation. As noted in the video, vitamin C promotes nitrosation. But ferulic acids (found in many plants) and caffeic acids (found in all plants) “markedly inhibited nitrosation”. The 2007 study by the lead author E. Combet analyzing the vitamin C and fat interaction was done “in vitro”—in the artificial environment of the test tube. E. Combet has followed up with two published studies in 2010. This is from the abstract of one of the studies: “Nitrosation has been studied in vitro in aqueous systems and less frequently in organic systems; however, there is a need to investigate acid-catalysed nitrosation in a system combining aqueous and lipid environments, hence providing a physiologically relevant model.” In some instances “unsaturated fatty acids acting as scavengers of nitrosating species, findings relevant to the nitrosative chemistry occurring in the stomach, where the gastric acid meets a range of dietary fats”. (“Development of an in vitro system combining aqueous and lipid phases as a tool to understand gastric nitrosation” PubMed ID: 20112267, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20112267 .) The other E. Combet study is at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20026204 PubMed ID 20026204. Does this make sense???  Thank you Dr. Greger for your fascinating web site. I have just recently discovered it and find myself very busy taking lots of notes!what if i have some beetroot juice, rocket leafs and a bit of cheese is this badI’m confused now. The video talks about the problems of “fat”, not just animal fat. Yet, we have previous videos that talks about the importance of adding fat to salads in order for our bodies to absorb the nutrients from leafy greens. :http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/forego-fat-free-dressings/So, we want this cool process from our arugula and yet by adding the fat it could create the carcinogens?

I have just recently discovered it and find myself very busy taking lots of notes!what does the botton line means?【our body wasn;t designed to get its vegetables in the form of bacon】I’m confused. If you are having an arugula salad or having grated beets on your salad, is it safe to have something containing fat such as avocados or walnuts at the same time?Ok so I read the rest of the discussion, and I have to say, this whole concept seems totally counterintuitive to me. So eat some beefs or greens and they can either be great for your heart or carcinogenic, depending on whether you remember not to eat some nuts or avocados 3 hours later? There is something wrong here. I don’t believe “nature” would make nutrition this confusing – something you have to figure out via scientific analysis. Primitive people could never have known this.Primitive people didn’t eat meat with chemical additives. Also they didn’t eat meat all the time. Skip the bacon, nothing to confuse.","['animal fat', 'antioxidants', 'bacon', 'cancer', 'carcinogens', 'cardiovascular health', 'fat', 'food additives', 'meat', 'nitrate', 'nitrite', 'nitrosamines', 'phytonutrients', 'pork', 'preservatives', 'processed meat', 'vegetables', 'vitamin C', 'vitamin E']",The addition of vitamin C to processed (cured) meats such as bacon may actually make them more carcinogenic.,"If you haven't seen it, or need to brush up, the carcinogen-blocking effect of phytonutrients to which I refer was covered three days ago in Prevention Is Better Than Cured Meat.

How much should I drink? How often? When? 2 cups, before running, perhaps?The participants in the study drank a glass of beat juice 2.5 hours before the activity. hahaha I just dried to chug beet juice, ive had beet juice before (but never alone) and had few side effects except red poop. I drank about half a liter and first I wanted to see my tongue, I was sure it was going to be super red and it was! and about 3 seconds later uhh ohh…i guess it wasnt such a good idea. It came out of me twice as fast as it went in and had me running to the bathroom! any studies on beet juice and a clean colon? ahahah luckily nothing too badI’m just wondering if pickled beets have the same effect. Does the act of pickling in some way reduce the efficacy of the good stuff?Hi Dr. Greger, In additoin to beet juice, Vegan triathletes like Rich Roll are also using cordyceps and maca for endurance, and the recent book “Eating on the Wild Side” by Jo Robinson mentions watercress for aiding recovery from strenous exercise. Do you have any views on these?I’m an elite cyclist and use Beetroot juice before races most of the time, thanks for sharing this info with us Michael. I’be been Vegan for almost a year now and have never felt better. I’d be interested to know if I should be upping intake of certain things to account of the amount of exercise I do.Should I be having more protein than the average person doing recreational exercise? If one could look at a perfect healthy diet what would it look like. Is there anywhere online we can see a plan for a ‘perfect’ diet?Many thanks.In terms of protein, protein needs match caloric needs, so when you exercise, you tend to consume more food, which will inevitably lead to greater consumption of protein. There is no need to seek protein rich foods or to supplement additional protein. I would suggest consuming something containing carbohydrates immediately after physical activity.“The Anabolic Phase: The 45-Minute Optimal Window The anabolic phase is a critical phase occurring within 45 minutes post-exercise. It is during this time that muscle cells are particularly sensitive to insulin, making it necessary to ingest the proper nutrients in order to make gains in muscle endurance and strength. If the proper nutrients are ingested 2 – 4 hours post-exercise they will not have the same effect. It is also during this time in which the anabolic hormones begin working to repair the muscle and decrease its inflammation. Immediate ingestion of carbohydrate is important because insulin sensitivity causes the muscle cell membranes to be more permeable to glucose within 45 minutes post-exercise. This results in faster rates of glycogen storage and provides the body with enough glucose to initiate the recovery process (Burke et al., 2003). Muscle glycogen stores are replenished the fastest within the first hour after exercise. Consuming carbohydrate within an hour after exercise also helps to increase protein synthesis (Gibala, 2000).” http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11098159Isn’t this a myth or was debunked? If normal “broscientists” are saying its fake then you’d think its not true or atleast some reason for people not believing it…How can a broscientist debunk anything?Many thanks for the information Dr. Greger , I’m passionate about vegetables but the WHO acceptable daily Intake for nitrate is 3,7mg/Kg/day ( follows link) which results in 300-400mg per day, the same dose recommended by these papers, that worries me a little, what do you think? http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=28&po=8","['athletes', 'beet juice', 'beets', 'beverages', 'cycling', 'energy', 'exercise', 'juice', 'metabolism', 'mitochondria', 'muscle health', 'muscle strength', 'sports medicine', 'vegetables']","Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies convinced the scientific establishment that nitrate-rich vegetables such as beets could noticeably improve athletic performance.","For an explanation of this boost in the mitochondrial efficiency of human energy extraction, see Priming the proton pump, the second video in my series on the performance-enhancing effects of vegetables.

I’m still working on getting some of that powder.I appreciate you making note of the source of the studies on the dragon blood. I won’t run out and buy some. But I will note that the picture of the bleeding tree is right out of a horror movie. Oh my.Why did Dr. Greger leave out any mention of a safe substance also tested for antioxidant activity in this study that has over three TIMES the antioxidant potential of amla? Amla has 301 mmmol/100 g and vitamin C has 1152 mmol/100g of antioxidant activity according to this same study.Dr. Steve: I guess that Dr. Greger left out the vitamin C supplement because he is restricting comparison to whole food products. In fact, he has several videos discussing the inferiority of supplements relative to whole plant foods.My understanding is that there is a body of literature supporting the notion that pure antioxidant compounds like like vitamin C have less overall activity in the body than the antioxidants from whole plant foods. The improved activity of antioxidants from whole plant foods may be due to synergistic effects that arise when a diversity of antioxidant compounds act together to modulate various cellular processes. To the best of my knowledge, the underlying reason why this happens is not well understood.Your question suggests to me that the total antioxidant potential of foods is just one dimension to a multi-dimensional description of the health value of foods. I guess that, as we learn more about the biochemistry of food interactions in the body, we will probably end up refining our food rankings.Great information, Dr. Greger!I am wondering if a more complete analysis of foods would also consider the level of pro-oxidants. Specifically, should foods be ranked by the mathematical difference between antioxidants and pro-oxidants, since they have competing effects?Is any research available on astaxanthin which seems to be touted as a wonderful antioxidant?Astaxanthin is the reason flamingos are pink (or at least flamingos in the wild; in the zoo they may be fed artificial dyes like farmed salmon–see my video Artificial Coloring in Fish). Astaxanthin is also the reason some crustacean shells turn red when boiled. One need not eat flamingo feathers or lobster exoskeletons, though. You can go right to the source and get it from green algae such as chlorella (I recommend against blue-grean algae and spirulina–see for example my videos Is blue-green algae good for you? and Another Update on Spirulina). A review last month suggests a wide range of beneficial effects, though one should note the author is listed as a dietary supplement industry consultant. With a few exceptions, I recommend against taking supplements as they have been found in some cases to be less effective (see, for example, my Produce Not Pills) or even deleterious (see Is vitamin D the new vitamin E? and my other 60 videos on supplements).Dr. Greger,Sorry if I’ve missed this from earlier. How does whole, frozen amla stack up against the dried powder? Figuring the whole fruit was bound to be more nutritious than any processed form, I promptly went out to my local Indian grocer and bought 6 pounds of the frozen variety for only $4/pound!Thanks!What about the maqui berry? the package boasts that these berries contain 2-3 times the anti-oxident as acai.Thanksis the amla powder marketed as a hair product at indian groceries the same as the powder for consumption?

They’re available as ‘craisins’ in low cost large quantity and make a great snack food.DSikes,Dried cranberries ranked higher (by about 30%) for antioxidant content than dried blueberries.Hope this helps.Dr. Greger,The data presented in the bar graph of this video does not agree with the data presented in the antioxidant table of the source article. Most importantly, the “top dogs” for antioxidant content of dried berries should be in the following order:1 = dried indian gooseberries (i.e. dried amla berries) 2 = dried dog rose 3 = dried wild bilberries 4 = dried blackberries 5 = dried whortle berries 6 = dried barberries 7 = dried rowanberries 8 = dried pomegranate seeds, etc.Note that rowanberries place much lower on the list than you stated (I think that you may have misspoken and meant dog rose instead). Also, you neglected to mention wild bilberries and dried blackberries on your graph.While the overall message of your video remains sound, you may wish to revise the data presentation for greater accuracy.Ther actually go through more than 200 berry and berry products! As I mention a bunch of times in this series of videos I try to stick to things you are actually available. Like in Best Berries I talk about dog rose berries but then dismiss them by saying “getting back to things you can actually buy in a store.” I do have a bit of fun in this video talking about a few whacky ones (“now just for trivia’s sake”) but indeed you’d have to go to the original source for the full list–that’s why I always make sure to list the sources! Have you ever seen dried blackberries? Bilberries? I would have included them if I had. I love Rain Vainik’s comment below about actually finding whortleberries–I’m glad I mentioned them!Thanks! Of course, you are right about the challenge of finding certain products in stores of major cities. Though, don’t underestimate the ability of your website to affect buyer interests. Dried blackberries could easily become available in stores once it becomes known that it is one of the best sources of antioxidants.Are dog rose berries “rose hips?” Are any kinds of Rose hips better than others? I can find some multiflora rose hips almost any day in the fall. Rose hips are an ingredient in many teas and are a common source of vitamin C. Some rosehips can be found here. If Americans know rosehips are available, and that they were eating them everyday, in many herbal teas, maybe we’d all be a lot healthier. http://factorydirectcraft.com/catalog/products/1258_1835_1802-5800-natural_dried_rosehips.html?ccset=US&zmam=62863317&zmas=1&zmac=1&zmap=5800&gclid=CjwKEAiA4_WjBRCNgf7A_KeE9jwSJADtegYdpc3RjrHK7BBcE4t4Eo3P2w5kpPhS33olJKn1mtXvlRoC9EDw_wcBI’m happy whortle berries are ranked high :) it seems to be the same thing as lingonberries actually http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccinium_vitis-idaea and they are very common in my country Estonia too :) I usually deepfry themReally… In the US, we only tend to find lingonberry at Ikea…Would this product count? It doesn’t say “indian” in the description.http://nuts.com/driedfruit/gooseberries/natural.html?gclid=CLvRy7axyq0CFQPf4AodXG2V9gThose look like Physalis peruviana (cape gooseberries) to me. Wrong berry (and ridiculously expensive!)I live in Sweden and in the end of the summer there’s whortleberries (aka. lingonberries) EVERYWHERE in the forests. You’ll come home with KILOS, for free! :-D However they are a bit sour but we often make jam out of them and also put them in stews.We have LOTS of trees with rowanberries as well, especially since the trees is used as exterior city design. But the rowanberries are the absolutely most bitter edible I’ve eaten. It’s disgusting. You can’t it directly from the tree, your face will start to cramp because of the sourness. I wonder if you can dry them at home and ground it to a powder or something.You’re the best Dr. Greger!You are SO lucky! My new volume 8 nutrition DVD comes out next month. Care to trade it for some whortleberry jam? :)Do you live near an Ikea? I have seen it there.Good! I’ve been consuming the gooseberries in my green smoothies! I don’t see maqui berries on this list. They are readily available now, too.what about mulberries!I found Amla powder in an Indian market, but wasn’t able to get back there when I ran out, so ordered Amalaki powder online, with the description of being from “the whole Amla fruit”. Is it equivalent to Indian Gooseberry powder, or diluted by using the whole plant and not just the berry?What do you say about sea buckthorn? They seem really good to me and costs about the same as blueberries, at least where I live. http://www.itmonline.org/arts/seabuckthorn.htmThanks for the interesting facts! I actually use barberries when they are available at BulkBarn (usually buying up a half bag as they aren’t always available.) I use them in my oatmeal (delicious with cut out orange, maple and cinnamon) and homemade quinoa crunch bars! :)Hello, Dr. I’ve heard talk of the Maqui Berry, a.k.a. Chilean Wineberry. I have seen claims–usually on websites trying to sell some derivative of it–that it is the most antioxidant-rich berry to date. (The stories mention acai berries). Is it true that this berry is the new king of berry hill? Has it displaced the almighty amla? Thanks! NeilAmla comes in a lot of different forms but one that I found was Chyawanprash which is largely made up of Amla. I looked up recipes for this and they boiled the Amla fruit as well as cooked the paste from the crushed fruit. So question is how does this compare to dried Amla powder, is there a drastic difference?I wish you were using scientific names. I would like to know if the whortleberry is also known as the red huckleberry, Vaccinium parvifolium, or the deciduous Mountain Huckleberry, Vaccinium membranaceum or the evergreen Coastal Huckleberry, Vaccinium ovatum. I would think any of these berries would be readily available in fresh form but harder to find dried.Vaccinium ovatum Vaccinium ovatumEnough with these boring and tiresome videos. If you truly want to share info then post the transcript. I will STOP following this site if these ridiculous and time consuming videos continue all for the plan to get one to buy something at the end.There’s a transcript link right under this video (and all videos on the site). So glad I can help!In health, MichaelYour videos are great.What about huckleberries, both deciduous Mountain and evergreen Coastal?Dear Dr. Greger: When rating antioxidants (ORAC scale) where can I find them rated by serving size rather by simple weight. The article you referred to seems to have them listed based on actual weight not per serving.Dr. ChelliahI liked the video – seeing the graph helps. Where in the graph would dried tart cherries or tart cherry juice – organic of course – come. I would like to compare them to goji berries but am having a hard time getting good informationI recently found a product which is new to me called “Antioxidant Fusion” by made in Canada by Made in Nature–It seems like it should be good–have you seen it, or have an opinion–sold at COSTCOWow, had no idea that Indian Gooseberries was such a high achieving snack.Have been making a tea out of Gooseberry powder, mainly to help combat high fasting blood sugar.By the way, Amazon.com has a wide assortment of dried barberries: http://amzn.to/19OL0aKWhat about dried black chokeberries? Can you inquire about them?Great vid and really interesting. Only thing for me is that I’m having trouble understanding how the scores in the source material line up with the values given in the bar graph presented in this video. The source material lists Amla as 261.53 but the video puts it as 7265… I’m guessing that you converted it to appear as antioxidant content per ounce rather than per 100g… but for what benefit?Dr. Greger, or other interested party, is there some antioxidant or “phytamin” besides vitamin C which might be responsible for the various positive effects attributed to Amla. The only thing I see mentioned anywhere is the large amounts of the vitamin C. Could vitamin C be responsible for the apparent effects?Hello, I have recently purchased some Amla and I struggle to find more information on the nutrition of these amazing berries, would you direct me to a database where I can find the mineral content? Thank youWhere do you get your Amla? The Indian and health stores do not carry them. If I could go online I would order them.Do you know if they included in the comparison “star fruit” aka “coromadel gooseberries”? ThanksFor some reason the sources weren’t pulling up for me when I clicked on them. Thanks.What about ARONIA? TxsAlthough Lupus is an increasingly common autoimmune illness, it is not mentioned in your list of topics nor in the body of articles or videos. Please advise the best “lifestyle medicine” for systemic lupus.you can purchase Amla goose berry powder at any Indian grocery store I bought one bag of goose berry powder 400 grams for 4 dollars ..you need to buy empty capsules or mix it with any health drink it tastes very bitter ! and will make you go to the washrooms after an hour ! better you put the alma-gooseberry in vegetable empty capsules !! its very cheap if you buy it at an Indian grocery store !What about redcurrants? From Wikipedia: “The redcurrant (or red currant), Ribes rubrum, is a member of the genus Ribes in the gooseberry family Grossulariaceae”. I live in israel and couldn’t find gooseberries anywhere, but frozen redcurrants are available here in health stores. Could it be that Redcurrants contain similar values of anti oxidants since they are from the same family? Thanks!Dried barberries are called zereshk and are very good in cooking. I make a vegan version of Persian stuffed peppers with a filling of ground tempeh and onions and zereshk, turmeric, saffron etc. that is really good. I’ll add my recipe to the web one day soon.http://www.facebook.com/livelovezrii you can get products made with the amlaki berry or Indian gooseberry! :-)What are all the dried fruits pictured in the antioxidant food table from smallest to largest?

Thank you again!SusanIs it better to take D2 or D3? Thank youThank you for your question. Please see my answer here: http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/take-vitamin-d-supplements-with-meals/comment-page-1/#comment-4418I recently purchased a vitamin D supplement from Whole Foods that is vegan (I don’t remember the exact brand and am away from home presently). It is a form of vitamin D called ergocalciferol (D2), which can be vegan if other non-vegan ingredients are not added. I just wanted to point out that the most common vitamin D supplement is of the D3 variety, cholecalciferol, which is of animal origin. Also, you are absolutely correct in your observation that 400 international units per day is not enough. I have seen too many people supplementing at that level who continue to be deficient. As far as whether or not one form of vitamin D is superior to another, I am not personally convinced at this point, for all practical purposes.Dr. Greger — I use Global Health Trax vegan D3. Each little capsule contains 5,000 IU. I have been taking 1 per day, but is this too much? Should I instead take 1 capsule every other day — would that be the better way to take this amount?

From watching various videos on your website I have come to the conclusion that smoking(not inhaling, but consider a scenario of a cigarette smoker contrasted with a cigar smoker) wouldn’t be nearly as big problem as any potentially harmful effects would just be muted by the extremely healthy life style the person was living. Or am I wrong to suppose that?Dr. Greger, could you say something about CoQ10, a coenzyme supposedly helpful in combating some diseases of the elder? Would you recommend it as a general supplement?Dr. Greger, I think it is important to point out that in this study, as with most population-based dietary studies, the threshold for consumption of fruits and vegetables is often absurdly low. The benefit in the risk of AAAs was found for those consuming fruit, vegetable and nuts more than three times per week and all you had to do to get the 50% reduction was eat either daily! There is no way to know how much more benefit a vegetarian or vegan diet might provide.PS. I really enjoy your website and appreciate all the work you do to put it togetherSo eating meat 2 to 4 times per month was worse for your risk than eating fast food every day? Hmm, questionable!Well, that is not necessarily the case.  You have to compare them using the error bars. Good ole statistics.  If error bars overlap at all, we can be sure that they are not statistically significant from each other.  So although there is natural variation in the results, it isn’t more variation than expected by chance.  Although eating meat 2-4/x per mouth was not (statistically) different from eating fast food, the results do seem to show support that eating meat frequently has a negative health affect compared with the other food categories. Also, check out why plant-based foods are so beneficial for many aspects of health. http://nutritionfacts.org/blog/2012/01/10/plant-based-benefits-extend-beyond-the-top-killers/It is scary how contaminated our meat supply is!  http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mrsa-in-u-s-retail-meat/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-poisoning-bacteria-cross-contamination/For some context, please also check out my associated blog post Watermelon for Erectile Dysfunction!so a patient with marfan syndrome should go vegan?was is it about the smoking?JUST DIAGNOSD WITH AORTIC ANUERYSM OF 1.3 CM .

Someone told me no tobacco, no alcohol, no animal products and regular workout is enough to avoid de top 10. Is that true?If you click on the Sources Cited section under the video you can read the latest CDC report on top causes of death in the United States. The top 10 are 1) heart disease, 2) cancer, 3) COPD, 4) stroke, 5) accidents, 6) Alzheimer’s, 7) diabetes, 8) pneumonia, 9) kidney disease, and 10) suicide. So being a nonsmoker who exercises and eats a plant based diet would certainly dramatically reduce your risk of the majority of these, but you’d still be advised to wear your seat belt, bike helmet, check your smoke detector, etc. For more on maximising your longevity check out my 37 videos on mortality.I have a question about Amyliodosis. Isn’t Green Tea and some Herbs beneficial to halt the progression of Amyliod Proteins? Meditiation and Yoga can cure Amyliodosis, isn’t it so? If you do stomach exercise as Baba Ramdev says. I believe some effect could result…..Hi Meha, I wanted to add another list and a couple thoughts to Dr. Gregers excellent response. A 2002 report listed the following: 1)Heart Disease 2)cancer 3)Medical Care 4)Stroke 5)Chronic Respiratory Disease 6)Accidents7)Diabetes 8)Influenza&Pneumonia 9)Alzheimer’s 10)Fire Arms.. slightly different leads to similar recommendations. I would add maintaining a good body weight. It is possible to be a “fat” vegan as John McDougall points out in his December 2008 newsletter.Dr. Gregers videos on avoiding heart disease #1- http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/low-fat-or-whole-food/ and on avoiding cancer #2- http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/slowing-the-growth-of-cancer-3/ are especially pertinent.. it goes without saying if you make good behavioral choices you will avoid the third leading cause of death… the medical industry!Can the results be trusted given the fact that they were sponsored by an institute that is set to profit from the findings?Depends. Do you want to cure disease in a petrie dish? If so, It can be trusted absolutely. If you prefer to cure disease in a human, regardless of funding source this sort of study is a “Hey researchers, take a look at this!” study, rather than a “Hey consumer, buy this!” type of study.Of course, if your change in behavior is to eat more apples, then the burden of proof is very low.For some context, please check out my associated blog post Alzheimer’s Disease: Up to half of cases potentially preventable!What do you recommend for chronic depression pleas?Hi D, check out some of these videos/research to see if they are helpful to you: http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=DepressionWow, that voice is annoying to listen to.

And as always, there are 1,449 subjects covered in my other videos–please feel free to explore them!It would be helpful (although perhaps too time consuming?) if the Sources Cited section included the URL for each website featured in the associated nutritionfacts.org video. For example, after a bit of Googling, I discovered that “Table 3. Top Food Sources of Cholesterol Raising Fat among US Population, 2005-2006 NHANES” was part of the following:Sources of Saturated Fat, Stearic Acid, & Cholesterol Raising Fat among the US Population, 2005–06. Risk Factor Monitoring and Methods Branch Web site. Applied Research Program. National Cancer Institute. http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/diet/foodsources/sat_fat/. Updated December 21, 2010. Accessed November 1, 2011.Google turned up another goodie that looks very interesting: The website for Finland’s National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) enables users to download, free of charge, a 300-page textbook on the North Karelia Project. The publication was written by Puska Pekka et al and updated in 2009: THE NORTH KARELIA PROJECT: FROM NORTH KARELIA TO NATIONAL ACTIONhttp://www.thl.fi/thl-client/pdfs/731beafd-b544-42b2-b853-baa87db6a046What a great find on the textbook Diane! I always link to the sources used in the video in the Sources Cited section, but the comments section is a great place to post related resources like that one. Thank you so much, and if you find anything else on this topic or the other 1,000 topics covered on the site please plug them in!Imagine if the United States adopted programs like this one!Incredible!Shhh–us doctors would be out of a job! :) Seriously, though, there has been tremendous resistance within the medical profession to the use of diet to prevent, treat, and reverse chronic disease. See my video The Tomato Effect for one of the reasons why.I can’t believe this! Found your site from the Forks Over Knives facebook posting and will definitely be checking back here daily. Why don’t we learn this stuff in school?I love Forks Over Knives! I was so honored to be part of one of their early DC premieres. And you’re absolutely right, Robzzz. Turns out even medical students don’t get trained on this stuff in medical school. Check out my video Do doctors make the grade? and the other half dozen videos on the medical profession. So glad you found the site!There are many reasons but most academics are doing research in other areas and most clinical faculty don’t know the studies and aren’t experienced in treating patients with a “nutrition prescription”. John McDougall has the most experience and he is involved in training medical students at his clinic. I believe in addition to medical schools nutritional information needs to be provided as a regular part of K-12 education. Of course many schools get money from deals with corporations putting dispensers in their schools and serving harmful foods in their cafeterias. Hopefully things will improve.Because vested interests do not want students to learn the truth, it means that students may be able to both think and question what they’ve been told.I’m not a teacher. But, was invited to speak before a class of Ethics at the University of Southwest Louisiana at Lafayette. I checked various references I had with the university library system to be certain that whenever I referenced an article, that the article would be available to the students. And told them, not to believe what I say, but to check the references themselves.I spoke of the heavy metals used in consumer products like fabric dyes and lipsticks, about endocrine disrupting chemicals and what they do to test animals, and mammals, including people. Some of the stuff was very scary, but made the kids think. I handed out a list of all my references to everyone in the class and told them the references were available in their university library.Some of the kids told their parents, who told the Dean, who had the professor dismissed. The parents told the legislators, who passed laws disallowing people like myself from talking to students of all ages UNLESS first cleared by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture, Wildlife and Fisheries, oil and gas industries (Office of Conservation and Department of Natural Resources), and other vested interests.I did not say anything that would point the finger at any particular industry and only said what I had read and where it was read. But vested interests did not like that information from going to students. Instead, they wanted only “approved” lies to come in contact with our ears.When I was in school, I was taught to think and question, to look up studies and see who funded them. That apparently does not stand in the USA any longer.Based on how that one teacher was treated, my daughter was directed to schools outside of the South, where she would receive a more “liberal” and open-minded education, which she did. She has no desire to ever come back here, which is fine with me. I just wish we could get out as well.There is a reason that Louisiana is a dump for the rest of the nation, why people here are fatter and sicker as a whole than people elsewhere. I blame it on the “controlled” education students are receiving –controlled by corporations!Susan: That is a truly jaw dropping story. It would be bad enough if that situation happened at *any* grade level, but to happen at a university level is tragic.That mentality is so hard to understand. I feel for you. I hope you will be able to get out at some point too. Good luck.Wow that is truly scary, yet why am I not surprised?For some context, please check out my associated blog post Dietary Guideline Graphics: From the Food Pyramid to MyPlate, Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate, and PCRM’s Power Plate!Why is it never mentioned what the animals are fed? This directly impacts what type of fats are prevalent in their meat/dairy. And the fat quality, as we all know, has a direct effect on ones health. Most meat/dairy is raised on corn and soy and grain and that spells bad fat in the products from those animals and bad fat for us on our plate. If they are grass-fed the fat is very different and does not pose the heart disease and other health risks. These distinctions need to be noted more often – perhaps you can pave the way for better nutritional science? What is your evidence that because a cow is fed different food, that the inherent substances found in meat is somehow altered? Saturated fat, cholesterol and trans fats are still inherent compounds of meat. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/Endotoxins and increased IGF-1 levels are also unavoidable. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-intake-and-igf-1-production/ http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=endotoxemia Meat still causes inflammation whether it be wild game or conventional beef. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/modern-meat-not-ahead-of-the-game/The issue is not organic or conventional, but the inherent compounds found in meat that cannot be avoided by what the animal eats.Please cite peer-reviewed scientific studies that support your flawed and unresearched hypothesis. From a credibility standpoint, facts take precedence over conjecture and hyperbole.Peer-reviewed scientific studies have led us to longer, but much worse quality lives so far. I think for every scientist open mind and critical thinking is much more important than acceptance by current peers. In fact, peer reviews and critical thinking very often leads to conflict of interests which,in turn, leads to calling some doctors – quacks.Good points Lisa Marie. Frankly, after all the movies and statistics (that always can be modified and control points changed in order to please or not to please) I’m still not convinced that natural, organic fat is bad for us! What nations or prehistoric societies did not eat animal fat? Our brain is nth but fat! What seems very unnatural looking through the history is eating grains. Considering that cultivating grains is pretty recent invention and all scary diseases pretty much started to appear around the same time.","['berries', 'cancer', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cheese', 'chicken', 'cholesterol', 'dairy', 'dietary guidelines', 'eggs', 'farmers', 'Finland', 'heart disease', 'heart health', 'lifespan', 'longevity', 'meat', 'mortality', 'pork', 'saturated fat', 'School Lunch Program', 'USDA']",The success story in Finland shows that science-based dietary guidelines can save millions of lives.,"Please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and I’d be happy to try to answer them.

Avacados are on their forbidden list because of the fat content.So, I assume that since avocado persin “rips cancer cell’s chromosomes apart from limb to limb” and that it does so in “normal cells, too” that avocados are NOT good for you? My poor avocados! Must I really say goodbye?Unholy guacamole? Don’t shoot the messenger! The ending is just a preview of Monday’s continuation of the avocado story and there is indeed some concerning data. Let me know if you have any followup questions after watching part 2.This is truly a cliff-hanger!! :-) I love my avocados so I’m really going to lose sleep this weekend until part 2 comes out. (Great site by the way!) :-)Me too! I was literally eating avocado on (whole grain) toast as I watched this video – feeling quite smug that of course the answer would be a resounding YES! Avocados are absolutely good for you!What should I do with the other half of my avocado? How can I possibly wait until Monday to find out??Does a avacodes have mercury in them? I get real sick when I eat anything made with them, no, bad!Bim-dependent apoptosis?? Man, I love it when that happens to cancer cells…….My cholesterol came in at 239, HDL 81 and LDL 160.  I eat mostly fruits, vegies, nuts, and fish.  I also exercise at least 3 times a week.  At 5’9″ 128 lbs, I feel in great health.  If I completely cut out the occasional piece of cake (about 3-4 times a year), will that lower my cholesterol? In my clinical experience it isn’t the occasional stuff that gets us in trouble and it would depend of course on the recipe for the cake (e.g. vegan vs non-vegan). To lower your cholesterol you need to avoid all animal products as they all contain cholesterol. Avoid all saturated fat which the body makes into cholesterol. Saturated fat is found in all animal products plus processed oils and is even higher in some plant foods such as coconut oil than in butter see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-coconut-oil-good-for-you/. It is somewhat complicated see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/extra-virgin-olive-oil/ and the other videos on saturated fats plus the videos on Omega 3’s.  So the first step in your diet would be to stop the fish… see any of Dr. Greger’s 60 videos for reasons to avoid fish from the cholesterol and saturated fat to toxic chemicals  such as mercury to carcinogens such as dioxin to other substances such as medications. The exercise is helpful in many respects but has a minor effect on cholesterol about a 1-5% reduction depending on amount. Dr. John McDougall has information on his website under Hot Topics which you might find interesting and useful. It is important to work with your physicians for further modifications.Good luck.I AM LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE FOOD THAT IS GOD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND ITS IN ARE STORES  How much avocado would a person need to eat for it to be harmful?Are there ANY foods that u recommend people focus their diet on?  lolso am I to take from this that limiting the intake of guacamole should be observed?

Be sure to check out the other videos on estrogen. Also, there are 1,449 subjects covered in my other videos–please feel free to explore them!Great website and info! Thanks Dr. Greger.Great stuff as always!Did the data on the nutritional profile of the paleolithic diet come from one of the cited studies? If not, could you provide the reference.Thanks :-)I am confused about how this relates to another one of your videos. This implies high estrogen levels coincide with breast cancer. But another video says it’s good to eat soy – which produces estrogen (or does it?) – to prevent breast cancer. Can you please clear this up?I agree – I viewed that video and had the same question. I ate foods containing soy before my diagnosis on a fairly regular basis. Now,my Oncologist tells me not to take supplements of soy but okay to eat in moderation or in a protein shake. I had a lumpectomy, radiation and no chemo. YAY for getting it out early! I say listen to your body. eat right and exercise. Live with out worry — If anything stress causes cancer not too much or not enough of something in one’s diet.The soy in estrogen is a phytoestrogen, which is 200-400 times weaker than animal estrogen. Forget what you heard about soy and estrogen (; the estrogen in soy is also in all beans and all seeds, and the estrogen in soy (which again is a phytoestrogen) actually has been proven to reverse breast cancer, because it occupies hormone receptors but it is much much weakerSoy and all plants have phytoestrogen. Phyto comes from Greek, meaning “plant”. Phytoestrogen doesn’t do anything in the body of anything that is not a plant. The human body DOES detect phytoestrogen and then thinks it has too much and cuts its own estrogen production. That’s why soy and probably most plants can help slow or reverse breast cancer. Dr. Greger can probably clear it more than I can ;)“Research on the relative impacts of phytoestrogens and synthetic hormone disruptors. Newbold, RR, EP Banks, B Bullock, and WN Jefferson 2001. Uterine adenocarcinoma in mice treated neonatally with genistein. Cancer Research 61: 4325-4328. http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/61/11/4325.abstract“Newbold et al. report that when neonatal mice are exposed to genistein—a phytoestrogen present in soy—later in life they develop uterine cancer of the same form caused by diethylstilbestrol (DES). The levels of genistein used in these experiments are comparable to those found in infant formula based on soy.”Xenoestrogens is a catch-all term for synthetic contaminants like DES, DDT, etc. which interfere with estrogen signalling…See more: Arnold, SF, MK Robinson, A Notides, LJ Guillete, Jr. and JA McLachlan. 1996. “A yeast estrogen screen for examining the relative exposures of cells to natural and xenoestrogens.” Environmental Health Perspectives 104(5):544-548 http://www.ourstolenfuture.org/newscience/phytoestrogens/phyto1.htmPLease note that as of recent, (after 2006 or so) we know that mice/rats have a totally different metabolism of genestein than humans, so all the studies that looked at mice are really moot. Human studies all indicate that moderate WHOLE soy intake (not powders of pills) actually reduce cancer risksHmm, that logic seems a bit unsubstantiated by research. Anecdotally, my PMS symptoms (cramps, breast enlargement) increase during months I consume a serving of soy daily.In theory the soy plant estrogens occupy estrogen receptor sites preventing the stronger human estrogens getting to the sites. I’ve heard Tamoxifen acts similarly. Now do note the Orientals from what I can tell eat primarily fermented soy such as tofu, miso, etc. and definitely not edamame. In particular the fermentation process reduces the plant estrogens quite a bit (how much?) from edamame. Now we’re vegans eating quite a bit of kale, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, cruciferous vegetables which have a mild estrogen reducing effect. Extracts are available for those who are interested. We tend toward whole foods.Sorry, I know I’m a little late on this comment, and maybe I am totally wrong here, but I’ve found random information stating that there are many foods that we commonly eat that contain phytoestrogen – like all nuts and seeds, all beans, and to a lesser degree, all other plant foods. Has anyone else found this?Please do not refer to people of Asian origin Orientals. Oriental is a rug Asians are people!That is fascinating. Can you please explain if this has an effect on the perimenopause and menopause when hormone levels fluctuate and eventually stabilize at reduced levels.First of all this site is awesome, Great job keep it going forever :) , I have a question not about this video i hope you can do another video about grains in general and corn specifically .The question is : Is corn good for us? (if so is it very good ,medium ,low ect.)Thanks, Jennifer. Am I understanding correctly that you are saying that the higher estrogen levels are naturally produced by the body – and coincide with breast cancer – not added from the soy, and that the soy can reduce those levels (b/c of phytoestrogen detection)? So where did all the talk about soy possibly increasing cancer risk come from due to its causing estrogen levels to rise? Dr. G, are you answering these questions? AND — what about estrogen and ovarian cancer and the connection to eating soy or other food? Thanks, All.The “talk” came from mice studies…we know now that humans don’t metabolize the same way. A recent study of over 9000 women confirmed it.Dr. G, are you responding to these? I so appreciate this website and all the fabulous info on it, and I am sure you are super busy. But it would be great to be able to get some feedback when there is confusion about the videos since we make important decisions based on them! :-)I see the good doctor has not had time to respond. I wonder if someone with expertise in this area can respond. I’ve heard that phytoestrogens are not harmful, but why? The last I heard (10+ years ago) we still have difficulty proving other xeno-estrogens are harmful (i.e. from the pulp and paper industry discharges, etc.). I guess I really should go to pubmed and search for phytoestrogen AND cancer.Some of the confusion stems from the fact that the vast majority of studies that initially hinted at potentially harmful effects were conducted on rodents, using dosages well beyond what the average person consumes in a life time. Clinical and epidemiological data, on the other hand, have generally failed to show similar risks.In fact, some have shown benefits, such as a 2010 study on menopausal women, who were administered soy isoflavones for two years, which concluded that “soy and soy isoflavones may provide a mild benefit to hot flashes, lipids, and bone health for some menopausal women” (Clinical outcomes of a 2-y soy isoflavone supplementation in menopausal women Am J Clin Nutr February 2011 93: 356-367)Another 2009 study of over 68 thousand women concluded that soy foods appear to protect against colorectal cancer risk (Prospective cohort study of soy food intake and colorectal cancer risk in women. Am J Clin Nutr February 2009 vol. 89 no. 2 577-583).Similarly, a Japanese population study of over 75 thousand men and women found a decreased risk of lung cancer among people who consumed soy products on a regular basis (Isoflavone intake and risk of lung cancer: a prospective cohort study in Japan. Am J Clin Nutr March 2010 vol. 91 no. 3 722-728 ).Given the existence of (weak) evidence that postmenopausal therapy with oral estrogen may increases breast cancer risk, it is recommended that women at risk of, or who already have been diagnosed with breast cancer, should avoid soy products just to be on the safe side. For more information on phytoestrogens and their benefits, see: http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=phytoestrogensAnother great video review of research I would otherwise not have seen, thanks for sharing this!Dr. Greger, Is this your voice on the videos? AllisonAll me! (though sometimes you hear my dog Lilly barking in the background :)HI DR GREGER,  MY DAUGHTER GOT BREAST CANCER AT 29YRS OLD AND DIED AT 32YRS LAST YEAR.  SHE WAS INITIALLY TOLD MISDIAGNOSED AND TREATED.  SHE WAS TOLD THAT SHE DIDNT HAVE THE BRCA GENE.  SEVERAL YEARS LATER HER NEW PHYSICIAN SAID THAT SHE  HAD TRIPLE NEGATIVE RECEPTOR GENE AND HAD  THE BRCA GENE.  I HAVE BEEN VEGETARIAN FOR EIGHT YEARS AND IM NOW VEGAN  FOR ABOUT 4YRS.  WE STILL HAVE OTHER DAUGHTERS AND A SON TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING CANCER TOO.  IS THIS CANCER DESTINED TO EFFECT MY OTHER CHILDREN TOO(SOME EAT MEAT AND DAIRY LIKE THEIR SISTER DID)?  THANKSIt’s been awhile since you posted I hope all is well. Myself I’m not a doctor but my sister had breast cancer at 24 the first time received a radical mastectomy, chemo and radiation she got it the second time at 35 and had a mastectomy on the other breast (not radical) chemo and radiation as well both time they were very aggressive cancers. When she tested positive for BRCA gene and her oncologist was harassing me that I needed to have mammograms every 6 months for the rest of my life (without even offering a test), I flat out refused. My sister is now 48 and this year voluntarily had her ovaries removed (because of the gene) I don’t let them touch me and I don’t care if I have the “gene” or not and I turn 45 next month with no health issues (even though I’m slightly overweight) I have been vegetarian most of my life (as opposed to my meat and cheese loving sister) and I have been strict vegan going on 2 years now (although I’ve always leaned than way anyway). I don’t think being vegetable based is everything, I think lifestyle and stress are really important too but I think it’s really important to check and know your body. What I feel is most important to not be too paranoid that you jump on every “buzz word” or preventative treatment. I have no proof but who’s to say my sister would have got cancer the second time around if she didn’t go for a mammogram every 6 months – that’s a lot of tissue damage and radiation (that accumulates) and who knows what the latest treatment of removing her ovaries will do?how does eating 2TAblespoons of ground flaxseed daily effect estrogen levels in women??any risk/danger of consuming it?phytoestrogens are different from xenoestrogens. phytoestrogens, found in only plants, do NOT raise estrogen levels while xenoestrogens, found in milk, significantly raises estrogen levels. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/just-the-flax-maam/Great information to know! Thx.Please also check out my associated blog post, Stool Size and Breast Cancer Risk!would the addition of 2 TB of ground flaxseed be worth adding to a strict low fat(vegetables,fruit,beans and brown rice,air popped org popcorn) vegan’s diet? It would be extremely benifical. Flax seeds have a wide variety of benifits and attributes. Check out Dr. Greger’s videos on flax seed consumption. on page 2 http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=flaxDoes animal products also help produce more estrogen as well?Hi Dr. Gregor,Thank you for all the hard work you do and the great DVD’s.  I just received Nutrition Facts 10 and 11, as well as the top diseases. Awesome Presentations! I was wondering if there was a way for me to borrow some of your power point slides for a project I am presenting for a chef program I’m completing at the Nutritional Therapy Institute. I was under the impression they were more plant based program. They are heavily plant based, but have a deep connection with the Weston and Price Foundation. They are into animal products as long as organic and grass finished. As typical, I’m getting a lot of grief for being plant based (I have been taking little bites of what we create so I’m not able to follow true vegan right now) They seem to be able to manipulate studies showing the benefits of meat and are teaching theories that a meatless diet is harmful. I’m presenting on cancer at the end of the semester. I’m using the articles you cite. If you’re able to send me any of your slides, that would be great. I am focusing on breast and colon cancer. They actually made fun of Pritikin dying of cancer and implied he committed suicide because of his low fat plant based diet. I  will be explaining how long he lived with cancer (27 years) and what really made him commit suicide ( experimental chemo leaving him half dead) I’m hoping they don’t hold my presentation against me in final grading.  Please feel free to send me a blank CD-ROM or flash drive and a SASE and I’ll burn any slides you want. Note, though, that you have to have a mac and iWork since they are Keynote files (not powerpoint):Michael Greger 5113 Crossfield Ct. #9 Rockville, MD 20852So glad I can help!In health, Michael Greger, M.D.Your research and information is why I am still cancer free. You need to have a show on the TV network stations instead of all those meat, dairy, and butter cooking shows.The Adventist study at 1:00 seems to say that “pure vegetarian women” had 0.34 risk for breast cancer compared to omnivores: does that mean they had 66% less risk for breast cancer? That’s a pretty amazing statistic if i’m reading it correctly!Hi M85 :) Yes you are reading it correctly. What I love about Dr. Greger’s work is that he always cites his original sources, if you are interested in checking those out. Here’s an another one of his amazing pieces on diet and cancer: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slowing-the-growth-of-cancer-3/ Cheers!Thank you. Then that’s just amazing!! Why aren’t women being told this? I bet women that have been vegan for a long time probably have an even lower rate, i remember Dr. Fuhrman saying that adventists that had been vegetarian the longest actually had an even longer average life expectancy (+13 years) compared to the other vegetarians.M85,Now that is the $64,000 question! Dr. Greger talks about this in his video http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/ A longer answer is in the book “The China Study” by T. Colin Campbell, PhD, and his son Thomas M. Campbell, MD. Help us spread the word…Pass on Dr. Greger’s video to a woman you care about :)lol these poopsicles are known as Minnesota PopsiclesHello Dr. Gregor, a friend of mine has been diagnosed with premature menopause at 43 yrs old and has very low (33 which apparently should be 600?) levels of oestrogen. I would like to direct her towards a plant-based eating plan.

As always, feel free to leave any questions you may have below.I get that Kelp affects the thyroid-but what is hypothyroid? Do you think it is effective to treat it with a measured amount of kelp instead of drugs? (If you get the blood tested to see the effects?). And just how much kelp will “hurt” you? If you “od” on it one day (darn I am drinking smoothie with kelp in it now!) then it will leave your system eventually, right?After seeing these videos I stopped using kelp but I apparently did not eat enough other seaweed because my TSH and LDL levels were high on my last blood test. After doing some research I found Lynn Farrow’s book about iodine. Again the medical “wisdom” of the day is wrong. Iodine is needed in greater quantities because of the toxic halogens the environment. Traditionally Japanese people ate much more than the recommended amount of iodine in foods and perhaps that is why their breast cancer rates were so much lower. There is a protocol to supplementing iodine because of halogen detox side effects. Iodineresearch.com has some information.OK, so this is the one that mentions kombu. Clearly kombu can be of concern and I’m glad you have posted this video now. I’m low on my kombu and may not be replenishing it.I still don’t think my question is answered, however. The video clearly says to stay away from eating kombu a lot. I’m trying to figure out if this would be too much or not: A sheet of 2×4 inches of kombu in a pot of grains. And then that pot of grains or beans gets eaten over the course of a *week*. Is that too much iodine? Not safe?Also, does all kombu have too much iodine or are there certain brands which are safer?Here’s why it matters to me: Your videos make it clear that it is vital to get enough iodine. I don’t like (and am rarely compliant about) taking pills, so I’d like to get my iodine from my diet. I do like nori, but I’m still not clear on how much nori I have to eat and I’m wondering if I have to eat X sheets of nori every week (day?) or if I can mix it up by putting some kombu in a pot of grains or beans. Would spreading out that little bit of kombu over the course of a week be just right or is that still too much?Thanks!I’m bothered by the same question. How much is a gram of kelp? I use kombu to cook grains and given it’s divided between a bunch of people and is cooked into the food, I don’t think its an issue.Thank you for the question JJ. My favorite questions are the practical ones! Please see my video Avoiding Iodine Deficiency for specifics on quantities.Dr. Greger –I’m a big fan of tuno salad sandwiches (basically mashed garbanzos in place of tuna). I add some kelp granules to give it that “seafood” flavor.I use about 1/4 tsp of the granules per sandwich, which according to the label is only about 50%DV of iodine.Is this much kelp still too much?VeganRyan: Any chance of posting your tuno recipe? Or pointing me to the book that has it? (Sounds good to me!)I wonder if ground up nori in place of kelp would give it the same flavor? My city has a vegan restaurant which serves “phish and chips”. Put aside for a second the unhealthy nature of fried food – what they do is pretty cool: the fish part is tofu slabs. The batter part includes ground up (I think) nori. This ground up sea food (of some kind – now that I think about it, I should ask which kind) really gives it a perfect fishy flavor. I liked the taste and the idea lot. Your tuno idea really intrigues me. Thanks if you get a chance to share the recipe!I basically combine the recipes from Colleen Patrick-Goudreau’s “The Vegan Table” and the Happy Herbivore website (http://happyherbivore.com/recipe/mock-tuna-salad/). I use my favorite ingredients from each recipe, and omit a few.The mashed garbanzos are an awesome visual and texture replacement for fish, and of course are much healthier. Enjoy. :-)Thanks!If that’s just 50% of the DV, then it would just be 75 mcg. Sounds like a great way to get your iodine. Can’t wait to try your recipe!

Also, is there any vegan supplement that provides 100% DV of B12, D and Iodine all in one for those of us that eat only whole plant based foods?I’m trying desperately to get my mother to change to a vegan diet because of her heart issues, diabetes and cancer! She is doing really well with it so far, but because she had her thyroid removed many years ago, she’s afraid to eat kale, broccoli or anything in the cabbage family. (iodine related problem I guess)My question is…is it true that cabbage family foods need to be avoided for people who are on thyroid medication?There are natural substances in a wide range of healthy foods (including cabbage family vegetables, soy, flax seeds, and a hundred other plant families) that can interfere with thyroid function in those with inadequate iodine intake. The answer isn’t that we should avoid these super-healthy foods, but instead make sure we get enough iodine (the anti-thyroid effects are reversed in iodine deficient individuals with iodine supplementation). See my videos Avoiding Iodine Deficiency and Pregnant vegans at risk for iodine deficiency.Now your mom is a special case. The mechanism by which these substances are thought to work is by inhibiting iodine uptake by the thyroid (so this is why if you’re iodine deficient this can be a problem, but if you have enough iodine your thyroid gets all it needs even if you’re eating lots of these healthy foods–though one can overdo it, see Overdosing on Greens). Your mom doesn’t have a thyroid gland, so there should be no effect of cabbage family vegetables since she’s taking pre-made thyroid hormones in pill form.Can the efficacy of the thyroid pills be reduced by consumption of cabbage family vegetables at the same time as taking the pill?Over the last year I have had a lot of hair falling out, so am taking a supplement for hair growth. I decided to take an iodine supplement based on past experiences of low thyroid and because I eat a lot of greens that are said to interfere with thyroid/iodine function, and also a fair share of sea vegis. Now I am wondering if I am overdoing it. Any ideas? A few years ago I took a 24 hr iodine test and it came out ok. I think I’ll drop the iodine supplements.Please view this video for details on avoiding iodine deficiency. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2/My family and I eat lots of beans. I buy Eden Organic beans and I’ve noticed that they all list kombu as an ingredient. Should I stop using this brand?Also be sure to check out my associated blog post Optimum nutrition recommendations!I found the URL to the site of the report featured in your video: https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2010/193/7/iodine-toxicity-soy-milk-and-seaweed-ingestion-associated-serious-thyroidBut it only shows a few people who were affected by consuming soymilk with kombu.  It is unclear whether combining soy with kombu was the problem.  Some researchers would argue that soy consumption could have contributed to the thyroid problem.  I am wondering how many other people who have been consuming just kombu without exhibiting iodine toxicity as reported in the video.Is one bag (454g) of kelp noodles a day too much?Actually, Doc, my nearest nuclear power plant DID melt down! (I live about 100 miles south of Fukushima Daiichi). Happily, we were spared dangerous levels of contamination.But seriously, this kombu business… How long does iodine stay in the body? I do ingest kombu from time to time, but it is in small amounts, such as when I make vegan dashi soup stock by boiling a bit of kombu and several shitake mushrooms. Once a week? perhaps less? I really don’t think iodine is an issue, even if I get more than enough iodine on one given day. How long is it in my body? A few days?As for shijiki… really? Eden foods has posted an excellent English language article about this which sites evidence (by scientists in Ibaraki – my fair prefecture – that the alleged arsenic levels may be due to the acidic compounds used to test for it. And In addition, this is not something we in Japan eat very much of, and not even daily. Perhaps a spoonful with a bento lunch once a week? I don’t know of any reports of actual harm being done to Japanese consumers due to eating small amounts of the stuff. Certainly, the meat and dairy consumed in Japan is a far larger concern, don’t you think?As you point out, sea vegetables contain many beneficial nutrients. I don’t over do eating them (as Americans seem to do with many foods) and until hard evidence suggests otherwise will not refrain from consuming them.Thank you, with respect and great appreciation for all you do to bring us the latest in scientific knowledge about nutrition.Are you concerned about the sea vegetables and mushrooms in Japan these days? http://zesterdaily.com/world/should-you-avoid-post-tsunami-seafood-from-japan/Please give me Your opinon on liquId iodine concentrate vs levothroxine for thyroid treatment . rx 2 or more drops in water per day. or .50mg levothroxine.

THANKSDr. Greger, I am reading Kathy Hester’s book “The Great Vegan Bean Book” in which she states that beans in the kidney bean family should be boiled for 10 minutes — including cannellini beans — to rid them of “a toxic agent, phytohaemagglutinin, also known as kidney bean lectin” What does this toxin do? And do you agree with her remedy?Presently taking 1/8th teaspoon of kelp powder from plants grown in an Iceland bay away from shipping lanes. That amount has a bit more than the US RDA. Taking that with an equal amount of chlorella powder to bind any heavy metals which might still be in the kelp. Does that sound legit?Eden Black Bean soup has Kombu Seaweed, should we avoid it?I’ve heard that soaking kombu in cold water for a few hours, which the prefered way of making dashi, releases virtually no iodine. Is that true? I then thow away the kombu and use this subtle fragrant water to cook beans, soups, gravies and breads. I can’t find any reliable information about this claim and therefore ask for your insight.Off topic: I’ve been following several of the recommendations on this site for about 2 weeks now (more changes in the pipeline), and I’ve noticed a completely unexpected benefit – my persistent (but minor) tinea has almost disappeared without any ointment, powder, or even cleaning attention. Wow!Which of the things you were doing do you think positively affected your tinea? Thanks.Sorry, false alarm. It isn’t bad, but it hasn’t gone away completely yet either. I have changed so many things around the same time that it is difficult to know what caused what. But I still think all these dietary changes have been for the better :)Arame appears on the chart as a possible good middle level iodine content seaweed. However, it is a type of kelp according to the wikipedia article. Kelp is shown as dangerous. I’ll search for the source of this chart.Should these journal articles (cited in this video) be more freely available to the public? I found the article on Nutritional Value of Edible Seaweeds but I need to subscribe at $549 US.What is the iodine content of arame? What’s a good amount to consume daily?This guy claims that cranberries contain iodine, http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/iodine-foods/ 4 ounces = 400 mcg of iodine. If this is true, cranberries might be easier than seaweed.I am not sure about cranberries and their iodine content. I wrote about sources, here. Yes, I would agree that berries grown away from the coast would have less.I must be one typical example of this situation. Since a few years ago I have high TSH (about 6 to 7 mUI/l, normal is below 4), normal T3 and T4, thyroid ultrasonography normal, no symptom at all…. this year I did a ioduria test (on a 24h urine sample) and the result was 1332 mcg/l (normal is below 300). I used to eat a lot seaweeds, especially during my frequent travels to Japan, I do not see any other possible cause (I’m a long term vegan), so now I’m refraining as much as possible from eating seaweeds and taking essential oils to keep TSH to a more normal level. I do not have any anomaly apart from a somewhat high cholesterol (for a vegan: 1.92 g/l TC, I was between 1.20 and 1.40 before), which is also a known effect of hypothyroidism. Hadn’t I did the TSH test, I would never have suspected something was out of order, having no symptom at all.","['food poisoning', 'food recalls', 'foodborne illness', 'hijiki', 'iodine', 'kelp', 'kombu', 'nutrition myths', 'organ meats', 'plant-based diets', 'processed meat', 'safety limits', 'sausage', 'sea vegetables', 'soy milk', 'supplements', 'thyroid disease', 'thyroid health']",Excessive intake of kelp (kombu) or thyroid-containing sausages can lead to iodine toxicity.,"For more videos on iodine, see: Can Gargling Prevent The Common Cold?

When explaining this issue as the reason I can’t consume dairy, people tend to think I’m a tad wacky. But seeing it here makes me feel…sane. ♥Very good information. I was literally asking myself this very same question a couple of days ago, since I had recently heard it mentioned many times.Thanks again Dr. Greger. Keep up the great work!Love, love, love these videos. Proper science with the important bits underlined. The connection between milk and allergies / asthma and mucus / phlegm is well known. Many singers avoid milk for this second reason. And the opiates in milk serve an obvious purpose in mother-child bonding – which begs the question why so many of us drink the breast milk of another species.I’m a singer, and many singers avoid dairy before a performance because of this. I even heard the director of an elementary school musical warning her cast about this before the show. Go, Maimonides!“Dairy industry blames Jewish physician” Ha!Of course most Jews are in fact lactose intolerant. The Dairy Council must be perturbed at ethnic groups that can not digest their products!Good catch Doctor. I think the Dairy Council is in need of some new copywriters.As someone in a position of trust, you may want to review some of the statements in your video.First off, what is it that told you that the source article was a review, was it the title of the journal: “Medical Hypotheses”, or was it the long list of references?Secondly, what makes you think that article states that it is indeed fact? There is nowhere in that article that states that this is what happens. Perhaps I missed that part and you can quote it for me so that I can better understand.Finally, while you do indeed say that ‘this may affect that’ and ‘this may cause that’, most of this hesitation is invalidated by the fact that you earlier stated that this is certainly what happens since it is a fact.That being said, while I have little doubt in my mind that the milk industry is bending facts like every other large industry with rumours or myths or even evidence against them, I abhor when people with presumably noteworthy credentials say things in a way to make the general population think something is true, when it is simply a hypothesis. And so I must apologise for the somewhat hostile tone.-a Ph.D. Candidate in Biochemistry, Chemistry, Protein Dynamics, and Drug DesignThank you so much for your feedback! It’s very sweet of you to take the time to leave a comment. It’s a dream come true to have science-minded folks like yourself reviewing the site and it would be a great favor to me personally and to those visiting the site if you had time to review as many other videos as you can. If you don’t have institutional access to any of the articles I cite please let me know and I can email you PDFs.With specific regard to your comments, you’re absolutely right: “review” is only correct in the colloquial sense and not in the technical sense. So I should have said the “latest paper” on the subject instead. In fact I’ll add it to the queue of videos I want to rerecord just to make sure it’s crystal clear. I am indebted to you and all those who have noted site search glitches, videos with sound problems, etc. as I am constantly trying to improve on the site (while at the same time working on coming up with new content every day!).The Bartley and McGlashan paper I highlight is indeed more of an explanatory paper, trying to figure out the “why” rather than the “what.” Although reports of mucoid impaction tied to milk allergy go back nearly 30 years, such a large percentage of the population recognizes a milk/mucus link (see for example, here, here, and here) that allergies alone couldn’t account for such a widespread perception. That’s why this new paper is so interesting, offering a non-allergy explanation of why so many people report increased respiratory mucus production with milk consumption. Is their hypothesis (i.e. educated guess) correct? It hasn’t been tested, but hopefully it will lead to a fruitful line of research and I will make sure to keep everyone in the loop.And EH, good luck on your thesis!I appreciate that you responded and are willing to improve and review your descriptions.While I cannot access the article titled “Recurrent mucoid impaction in an asthmatic infant with cow’s milk protein allergy”, the article titled “The Milk Mucus Belief: Sensations Associated with the belief and characteristics of believers” states that even in non-believers there was a sensation of needing to swallow, of coating of the throat, etc. They also refer to a similar double blind study they did in which they report that the subjects also experienced the same effect with soy milk, and so conclude that these sensations are just something that comes with this type of drink and is not actually associated with cow’s milk itself.The next article titled “Patients’ perceptions of food-induced asthma” found that approximately 35% of respondends reported that dairy products had “made you start to cough, wheeze, feel short of breath or get a tight feeling in the chest?”, but with that same questionnaire, about 40% reported those same symptoms with fruits and vegetables. They conclude that ‘confirmation of these perceptions will require well conducted challenge studies’. More importantly here, they say that ‘health professionals need to be aware of their own beliefs.’The last study “Do You Believe Milk Makes Mucus?” found that there are equal proportions of people who think milk causes increased mucus production when considering those that have illnesses that could affect that effect (asthma, cystic fibrosis, and allergies). There are also an equal propotion of people that believe it across different ethnicities. The part of this article I personally find interesting is that the stated sources for the idea that milk causes more mucus is 9.8% pediatricians, 18.7% other physicians and 2.6% other healthcare professionals.Your argument that allergies alone could not account for such a widespread perception falls under the argumentum ad populum fallacy of argumentation that states that something is true because many people believe it is. Nobody has yet confirmed that milk does indeed cause increased mucus production, and until somebody does so, be it for some small percentage of the population, it is irresponsible to advertise it as being a true effect.I do look forward to seeing the results of that study though, being asthmatic myself.I too read this paper and think Dr. Greger’s video was representative in that all he actually stated was that it “appears to be fact” that milk increases mucus production.In fact, Bartley and McGlashan cite a number of studies that support dairy elimination and conclude that “These observations would suggest that in some situations a cow’s milk exclusion diet can be beneficial.”To support these observations the authors provided a plausible and testable mechanism to explain why a certain type of milk (A1) could increase mucus production in a subgroup of people who have increased intestinal permeability.Like I said, most of the wording in the video does indeed have a note of doubt in it, but most people will assume it is just turn of phrase. Scientists will often state things this way because they are aware that discoveries are rarely certain and even more seldom absolute, whereas for the general population, if you tell them it appears that drinking and driving cause accidents, the will take it as a fact because it is something they already think or know to be true.When you saw this video, before looking at the sources and reading the comments, were you not under the impression that milk did indeed cause mucus production?I got this from Dr. Mercola’s site on raw milk. What’s your take on it. (http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/01/01/cdc-misrepresents-raw-milk-statistics.aspx?e_cid=20120101_SNL_Art_1)Raw Milk is a Healthful, Living FoodHigh quality raw milk has a mountain of health benefits that pasteurized milk lacks. For example, raw milk is:Loaded with healthy bacteria that are good for your gastrointestinal tract Full of more than 60 digestive enzymes, growth factors, and immunoglobulins (antibodies) Rich in conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which fights cancer Rich in beneficial raw fats, amino acids, and proteins in a highly bioavailable form, all 100 percent digestible Loaded with vitamins (A, B, C, D, E, and K) in highly bioavailable forms, and a very balanced blend of minerals (calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron) whose absorption is enhanced by live lactobacilli It is not uncommon for people who drink raw milk to experience improvement or complete resolution of troubling health issues—everything from allergies to digestive problems to eczema. It is also common for people who have “milk allergies” to tolerate raw milk just fine. Pasteurized milk is a completely different story.Pasteurization Creates a Dead, White Liquid That is NOT Beneficial to Your HealthPasteurization turns milk into a dead white liquid whose health benefits are largely destroyed. Consider what pasteurization does to milk:The price of killing the pathogenic bacteria is that you also kill the good bacteria which helps digest milk and make it such a nourishing food Proteins and enzymes are completely destroyed or denatured, made less digestible and less usable by your body Immunoglobulins, metal-binding proteins, vitamin-binding proteins, carrier proteins, growth factors, and anti-microbial peptides such as Lactoferrin are destroyed Many vitamins and minerals are rendered biologically unusable Fats are damaged and destabilized Additionally, the bacteria killed by pasteurization are not removed, so their dead carcasses remain in the milk to ignite immune reactions in those who ingest them, which is one major cause of milk allergies. It isn’t really an allergy to the milk itself, but to the organic cell fragments it contains.Interestingly, Maimonides was right on alot of medical issues.  I believe he also  wrote that people needed to allow a sufficient amount of green space around cities for clean and, thus promoting optimal health.A reviewer on Amazon.com, commenting on one of the English translations of Maimonides medical writings said this:Maimonides studied medicine long before he decided to enter the profession because he knew that good heath is important to a satisfying life. He taught that prevention of illness and the maintenance of good health is the major goal of physicians and non-physicians alike. He focused his attention not only on the body, but also on the mind, the environment, a proper attitude, good interrelationships, the avoidance of stress, and other similar subjects.Maimonides was very modern in his approach to good heath by stressing exercise, proper foods, sufficient sleep, and recognizing that nature by itself, without the aid of a physician, can resolve many illnesses. His advice on health, contained in his medical, philosophical and legal writings, remains worthwhile reading today.Also be sure to check out my associated blog post Bad Egg!I didn’t see any research included in the video to prove the casein theory, just conjecture.I have a germophobic housemate of Jewish descent who is constantly hawking up phlegm and loudly blowing his nose. He thinks it’s just “allergies” but he eats meat, cheese, and dairy pretty regularly. His solution is to gargle Listerine, which I think is probably making things worse for him. Recent studies have found helpful viruses living in human mucous, and most of the bacteria we carry are beneficial as well. But he’s one of those kooky old dudes who will never be deep enough to change his habits, so he’s never tried eschewing meat and dairy to see how it might affect his health. Instead he baselessly insists it’s nothing to do with diet, and he just keeps on suffering and being a noisy annoyance to his housemates. What to do??That video really helped me a lot, because I’ve been very discouraged lately. I’m a singer in a band, and also I make my own music as a kind of solo project, and I noticed a few years ago I got sick and had all this phlegm and I thought well I just never got rid of the mucus, I never recovered in that aspect. But I also noticed..I drink sometimes 3 to 4 glasses of milk a day. That’s a lot..and it seems that my phlegm buildup is even more increased. I can barely talk and sing now. So I think eliminating milk although I love it so much would be healthy and improve my well being and vocal abilities. I hope.“Medical Hypotheses” being the keyword in this video.The journal name “Medical Hypothesis” is the keyword in this video.I have only recently excluded virtually all animal foods. My breathing feels easier, yet another unexpected benefit. Thank you Dr Greger for this material.JR: I had a conversation just this last weekend with a group of vegans who were all sharing various “unexpected benefits” after switching to their vegan diets. It is fascinating how many medical problems get cleaned up when people start eating healthy – sometimes problems they weren’t even really aware of beforehand.Congrats on your easier breathing.Right On! that’s the bottom line. I’ve experienced the same. When I asked the “Dr.’s” for help 20 years ago, with my constant sinus inflammation and congestion in my nose throat etc, their only solution was drugs and/or surgery-no mention of the power of plants alone! THANK GOD I was willing to eventually change. After all, the definition of insanity is o continue to do the same thing and expect a different result!Speaking totally subjectively here. I drink close to a gallon of milk a day.. I have no excess mucous or phlegm or any other noticable symptoms. I have done without for months at a time and just miss drinking it. No science, just satisfaction.Because you may drink milk does not automatically mean that you will produce excess mucus. This occurs with some popel, as milk may promote acne in some, but not all. There are major concerns with milk though other then this, such as the xenoestrogens and elvated IGF-1. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dairy-sexual-precocity/ http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=igf-1While you may show no symptoms of mucous of phlegm, there are also a litany of less symptomatic side effects. The video linked below specifically looks at prostate cancer growth when looking at almond and organic cow milk. Major concerns are also found in IGF-1 regulation with cow milk and we should evaluate our own personal health through multiple factors beyond noticeable symptoms.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-and-organic-milk-vs-almond-milk/The frowny face of the cereal is great!Chronic sinus suffer here, I found I was allergic to salycaletes, hence I would get a head cold after a night out. If I went to a more adventurous restaurant I would have severe headaches lasting up to 4 days. I had turbinate surgery. The worst decision of my life. I now have a constant post-nasal drip.The best things I have found work for me are:- 1. swimming in salt water (best in the surf), to clear out my head of mucus. 2. starting the day with fresh lemon juice, waiting 10 minutes, to then have green tea, inhaling the steam to help clear move the mucus and clear as much as possible, then having a healthy breakfast.I have always wondered about milk and mucus. I was told by GPs it was only in children it produced mucus, but tend to err on the side of caution personally.Oddly enough Coriander is my number 1 mucus maker. Have that in a meal and I have sneezed 10 times in half an hour on my way to a headache in an hour and migraine like pain in 4 hours. Makes food selection at a lot of restaurants a challenge!

However Dr. Mercola has shared that there are two types of cows and one type has the kind of milk that can cause allergy. They’re called A1 and A2.http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/07/09/The-Devil-in-the-Milk.aspxI like how http://www.westonaprice.org helps people find raw milk sources.Blessings! Ali in IL < We support Israel!Why is everything blamed on the Jews? Sheesh. Anglo Saxon white men have been in power for thousands of years, yet they are always touted for their discoveries and successes, never the war and indignities they’ve committed on humankind.I am 80 years old and spent 78 years suffering from post-nasal drip and throat congestion. I was constantly spitting to clear my throat. That stopped when I quit drinking three glasses of milk every day. I need no other test or proof.I am concerned about my sons ongoing problem with excessive mucous – he is well in every way, but has to regularly clear his nose of mucous – especially last thing at night & first thing in the morning.I would like to eliminate milk from his diet, which will be difficult because he loves it, has it with cereal every morning and drinks it every night before bed.If the excessive mucous is being caused by milk, how long would it take to notice any improvement if we completely omit milk from his diet?Hi Debre, I would recommend trying Almond Breeze unsweetened original almond milk. It tastes basically the same and is thinner then “silk” brand almond milk, which gives it the same texture as cows milk. I don’t think you will find much of a noticeable difference in taste. Give it a try! There is more to dairy then mucus too. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/xenoestrogens-early-puberty/Thank you for the suggestion of Almond breeze almond milk.However, due to the fact that I live in Turkey, it is not possible for me to get hold of any kind of milk substitute.(It is also not possible to find tofu, quinoa, soya products etc.)I am currently following a 98% vegan diet -as a result of the revelations I have learned from this wonderful website.I would like to cut out dairy produce from my son’s diet gradually.He is eleven years old – and agrees to try going without milk for one month.Would 1 month be long enough to see improvement with regard to mucous production?? With regard to calcium, I aim to meet his body’s needs for calcium by including lots of fresh vegetables in his diet, plus flax seeds, tahini and nuts.A month will be long enough to notice any mucous drop indeed. You can also attempt to make your own almond milk. From my understanding its quite easy, and you need a cheese cloth to strain them after blending the almonds. I would look online for a recipe.I would agree with Toxins that a month trial will allow you to see if there is benefit to the mucous problem. I would second his comment that there are many other reasons to stop or minimize dairy consumption. Calcium intake will be met by a whole food plant diet. I and I imagine others would be interested in how your trial goes. Good luck.Debre: What a bummer that you can’t easily buy foods like almond milk and quinoa, etc. I feel for you.I wanted to second Toxin’s suggestion of creating your own nut milks. It can be a lot of fun to make your own and while not as convenient, end up tasting a lot better than the store bought brands. If you have some nuts and a blender, it is easy to make any sort of nut milk – or even oat milk if you can get a hold of whole oat groats.For the filtering step: I have made nut milks using both a nut milk bag and just a common, small holed colandar. It just depends how picking you are about texture and how good the blender is/how small it chops up the nut bits.I have also made nut milks from nut butters (like say almond butter) instead of the whole nuts. Using a nut butter can make the process more convenient since you can avoid the filtering step all together. You just blend up a bit of nut butter with water – perhaps with a touch of sweetener and/or vanilla if relevant (such as for putting on cold cereal). A ratio you might try is: 1/4 cup nut butter to 4 cups water.It is a good testament to both you and your son that your son is willing to go a whole month without a food that he loves. I wish you both luck!I DO NOT TRUST THE GOV.This thing about the opiates in milk making dairy addictive, seems to me if you turn that around it explains why some substances are ‘opiates’ in the first place, they trigger mechanisms we’re evolved to have.Thanks for the video Mr. Michael.

A Convergence of Evidence, yes. Like the index and all of it. Very nice.Isn’t the index great? I couldn’t be happier with how the site turned out.Dr. Greger, thanks for launching such an invaluable resource! Yay! –DilipI’m glad you found it useful–please help me spread the word.And what’s even more amazing is how no one know this… Spread the word!The food and beverage industry spends billions of dollars every year marketing junk to us, to our children, contributing to the public’s confusion about basic, accepted nutrition principles. I’m glad to be one little voice trying to push out some science!Is Co-Q-10 necessary for heart health…if so, is ubiquinol so much better than ubiquinone? Or, is this just a lot of hype and another waste of money?Dr Greger: I had artery bypass surgery in 1997 and have a prescription for 40 mg. of lipitor to lower my cholesterol. Three months ago I went to a vegan no oil diet, and even though I cut the lipitor dose in half, I was pleased to learn that my cholesterol measured a mere 97. My LDL reading was also only 50 but my concern is that my HDL level was only a very low 27. Should I be concerned?Congratulations on improving your diet and reducing your medication. You have made great strides in minimizing the chance of recurrent problems. I would not worry about the low HDL. HDL goes down with the other cholesterols when you adopt an improved diet… partly due to the reduction in a transport molecule in your blood so free HDL is not as low as you might assume. The levels of LDL and total cholesterol you report should allow you to further reduce or eliminate your statin. You need to continue to work with your physician(s). I would suggest reading Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn’s book on Preventing and Reversing Heart Disease… he also has a new DVD out but I haven’t had a chance to view it yet. I would also suggest you read Dr. McDougalls newletter article on Statins, http://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2007nl/may/statins.htm and keep tuned to nutrtionfacts as the science and recommendations keep changing. Good luck.Incredible info. It’s such a shame that this info is NOT given attention from the media. One would think newspapers and media would be ALL OVER it. Ground-breaking news that is too practical to make the cut???The thing is, vegetarian diets for lipid lowering advice… It’s not first line advice, as of yet anyway, and to suggest it as a healthcare professional, one can be seen as promoting their own lifestyle without sufficient guidelines to back you up. So, when will this get enough regognition to be used as a first-line Rx????Never, I’m afraid. There’s no $ in it. Can you imagine what a big decrease in bypasses, other heart surgery would do to the profession? There´s no lobby for kale or broccoli, sadlyHi, We too long for the day that healthcare providers will have the majority voice on the optimal diet, but until then, we can have that one voice crying in the wilderness! Even one soul won will put out the word exponentially through their circle of influence, and so on and so on! One patient at a time. People still put a lot of stock on the word of a trusted physician, especially one who practices what he or she preaches. Physicians ought to promote what they have actually experienced. Their message will be that much more impactful. Walk your talk, talk your walk, ArleneDr. Gregor, could you please let us know where to find the interesting figure with phytonutrient compounds from different vegetables? I would love to use that when I talk to my patients about the benefits of a vegan diet.  I’ve added the source above and placed the graphic in supplementary materials. Too bad we can’t squeeze all 10,000-or-so in :)Also be sure to check out my associated blog post Breast Cancer and Diet!Excellent lecture you gave at the Nat’l Animal Rights Conference!!  Thank you for all you do.  It is very frustrating when I suggest the benefits of a plant-based diet to people, only to hear them reply that their physician tells them to keep eating lean meats and dairy…end of story.  They are done listening to anything I have to say.B12 is not well absorbed, thus the larger pills. Since it is stored in the liver and there is no known detrimental effect for overdosing, you should be fine with the 1200mcg a few times a week .Dr. Greger, I had the pleasure of meeting you at Health Fest in Marshall, Tx and loved your presentation Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death and bought several CDs. I eat a low fat, whole food, plant-based diet but recently my total cholesterol and LDL shot up. A year ago I was at 183 and LDL of 101, not as good as I’d like, but as low as I think I can get. This week I retested and it was 225 and LDL 137, HDL 70. I exercise strenuously 30 minutes/day and my BMI is 21. I am 52 years old. So . . . I’m wondering what other factors are at play and whether stress is a factor. Have you reviewed literature on the relationship between cholesterol and stress?I have the pleasure of taking care of patients at the McDougall Whole Foods program. One area you might look at is fruit and fructose consumption. Whereas “glucose” is our bodies fuel and burned by every cell in the body… “fructose” is only metabolized by the liver to uric acid, inflammatory aldehydes, triglycerides, cholesterol and glycogen. I have had several patients adjust their fruit consumption down or reduce consumption of recovery drinks or bars which might contain fructose. Even though your LDL is high your LDL/HDL ratio is good. As far as stress goes… it has been linked to a wide range of disorders… in my almost 40 years of practicing medicine I’ve been more impressed by the fact that when patients are under stress they eat and exercise differently. Keep up the good habits and stay tuned to NutritionFacts.org. As an athlete you might enjoy Scott Jurek’s book, Eat Run. He has recipes he uses for recovery.What changed? Stress?As a newly diagnosed breast cancer patient, I was hoping to find specific information regarding treatment in this video. I did not. I have followed a vegetarian diet for over 15 years, and a mostly plant based diet for the last three. Additionally I take multiple vitamins everyday, go to exercise classes at the gym 4 days a week and do not smoke, drink alcohol, coffee, tea or soft drinks. I still developed breast cancer. Stop telling people that this will not happen if they will only make better choices.I’m a vegan going on 6 months now. What I’ve garnered from all I’ve read is that it improves your odds against diseases. There are no gaurantees in life. No one here or anywhere has stated illness will not happen. I can tell you since I’ve changed my diet to entirely WFPB I feel so much better on so many levels. For one, I was borderline diabetic with very high cholesterol. Not anymore. That alone makes it worth it to me. I wish you well!I have been listening to many of your videos and I´m always impressed and schoked as to why we don´t know so much more. Thank you, thank you, thank you…. What about juicing, which seems to be a new fad?A plant based diet contains over 100,000 different disease preventing nutrients! I love it!I switched to a plant based diet nearly 3 years ago, lost 70 lbs and feel a lot better. One thing is still bothering me: I easily get cold. Right now I’m sitting in 80 degree F in shirt&shorts and feel comfortable. But at work, I’m wearing winter clothes and am still freezing. 2 weeks ago it hit me and I actually got a cold and sick. Any thing I could do?Additional info: I came to healthy eating listening to Dr. McDougall and then many more through his Advanced Study Weekends. I’m eating mostly whole plant and lately really ramped up my green leaves consumption. I’m easily constipated even on a whole plant diet. I’m now thankful for this near instant feedback.Dear Doc, I suffer from fluctuating blood pressure. It’s high in the mornings and drops to low BP around noon and rises again bY night. What would be Your advice for this issue? – PaulHi Paul, as you can see I am not the “Doc”!Is this an ongoing issue of fluctuations? For how long? How high? How low? Do you have any other health problems? Caffeine use? Tobacco Use? Stressed? Do you work at night or sleep at night-so morning for you is? In other words need some more information.The BP does normally have fluctuations throughout the day usually in pattern of: normally lower at night while sleeping. BP starts to rise a few hrs. before you wake up. BP continues to rise during the day, usually peaking in the middle of the afternoon. Then in the late afternoon and evening, BP begins dropping again.Hi Guys, My Dr recently commented on my Orange Palms and said I most probably have carotenemia- I eat a lot of coloured vegetables because I eat salads and cooked veg every day and I like my food to be colorful. I was trying to find out which fruits and veg I should cut out to reduce the orangeness… I eat carrots, including the purple variety, pumpkin, beetroot, red and yellow capsicums, tomatoes and sun dried tomatoes, and I have strawberries/ other berries/ mandarines at least once a wk- do I need to cut out all of these or just carrots? One source I found even said that spinach and broccoli where high in Carotene! Can you shed some light?AliceDoes gmo soybean beneficial on human health?Please stay tuned for Dr. Greger’s upcoming videos on soy and GMO.What do you mean “sometimes”… The final note should read… “ALWAYS BETTER”!How perfect are berries (as well as most fruit) for the human design.

Do you see this as a problem? Don’t we need both, and in relatively equal amounts? Is there a product you are aware of that does have sufficient amounts of both? How important is EPA as compared to DHA, and why dosen’t algae produce much EPA?EPA is metabolized to DHA which then is converted to the antiinflammatory and anti clotting substances our bodies need. So taking in adequate DHA would be enough and you need not worry about increasing the amount of EPA. Studies show that the supplements work…See video for more information: http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/Dr. Greger, Please indicate if studies support AJ of Epidemiology 4/24/11 report that men with higher levels of DHA were 2 1/2 times more likely to have an aggressive form of prostate cancer. What about contaminate free form of DHA, like MorDHA prenatal, EMAS status (most stringent European standard). ps does Algae also support eye health?About 6 months ago I started a plant based diet to lower my cholesterol, among other ailments. I have been taking flax seed oil capsules, but I have heard that fish oil is more effective than flax seed oil. My diet did lower overall cholesterol 30 points in 10 weeks and my triglycerides were reduced by half. Is there a benefit to algae vs. flax supplements for cardiovascular health?The short answer is that fish oil is not effective and comes with contaminants & saturated fats which are harmful. Since fish get the omega 3 plus EPA & DHA from plants (i.e. algae) you should eliminate the middle “person”. This eliminates the bad stuff and the fish come out ahead as well. The omega 3/omega 6 issue is a bit complicated. In 2003 Dr. Greger did a presentation on heart disease and nutrition which is now available as an 8 part series on YouTube (Dr.Greger’s Optimum Vegetarian Nutrition). Parts 3 and 4 of those talks explain the whole issue including DHA, EPA and AA issues as well as any that I have seen. I would review those to better understand the issue. The links for these are: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fsT2fAVEiA&feature=related (Part 3) & http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrZ0Wgtc7xQ&feature=related (Part 4). Some experts claim that if you consume a whole food plant based diet plus avoid processed oils you don’t need to take a supplement for EPA & DHA. As Dr.Greger points out this can be difficult to do so he recommends a 250 mg supplement daily. If you are going to supplement you should use an algae based product of which there are several see: http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/. This is especially important for women who are pregnant and breast feeding. Congratulations on your progress and keep tuned to nutritionfacts.org for more of the latest science.Thanks for the great info..Isn’t algae also potentially contaminated due to being from the same polluted ocean? I especially avoid anything from the Pacific Ocean since Fukishima..Many or maybe all(?) algae DHA supplements are grown in a lab – check the labels or websites.1.5 grams in the study is below the therapeutic dose recommended for fish oil which is in the 3 to 5 gram per day range. Not advocating fish oil, algae oil is still better but it’s a straw argument to say that no effect at 1.5 grams means fish oil cannot anti inflammatory. Need better QA here.Hello I use Usana Health Sciences Bio Omega Fish oil does it have contaminates? Norma Chabot cellfood@hotmail.comI don’t understand why anyone would consume fish oil and run the risk of contamination. The fish don’t make the DHA, EPA or omega 3’s that the body uses to make those substances. Since as Dr. Greger’s video’s point out their are acceptable alternatives that eliminate “the middle person aka fish” from the whole process. Of course then the question is should the general population consume omega 3’s as a supplement. As a general rule the only supplement you need on a plant based diet is Vitamin B12. The use of other supplements should be based on the individual patient’s situation.Would reverse osmosis be any better at filtering out toxins? ThanksI fail to see the evidence of a cause-consequence relationship between:1. the presence in fish oil of PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, brominated HNPs, and2. the lack of the effect of its supplementation on the serum concentration of a number of cytokines, chemokines or cell adhesion molecules as compared with placebo after 3 weeks.There are several alternative explanations to this “lack” of anti-inflammatory effect (I’d have liked to see the concentrations of other inflammatory markers such as CRP, directly linked to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease).Only a direct comparison between the effects after fish oil supplementation and a supplementation with omega-3 EPA and DHA from non-animal sources at an equivalent dose will actually tell us whether there’s a clear difference in the effect dependent on the source of the omega-3 supplement.In this line of thinking we shouldn’t eat any fish? (suplement or not) Are anything in nature that isn’t contaminated? Should we stop eating?Fish is by far the most contaminated animal food one can consider eating. Dr. Greger does indeed encourage we do not consume fish.I know someone taking Frutol a fish oil supplement. The site claims no detectable levels of heavy metals or PCBs.

Funny how we just think ‘hmm thats nice “Early Detection Is Your Best Prevention.” without really thinking about the point made that detection is NOT prevention.. #thingsthatmakeyougohmmmPingback: Bacon Linked to Higher Cancer Risk (Again) « Maxim Fetissenko()Pingback: Unit 2 Compilation – Chapter 18 | imsandradee2()Pingback: Breast Cancer Prevention and Survival with Healthy Nutrition »()As a breast cancer survivor, I am in need of clear information on nutrition.  I have listened to vegans and meat-eaters.  I followed raw/raw vegan.  Then I read literature on macrobiotics and other oriental advice which say vegetables must be cooked/steamed because we do not have the enzymes to digest raw plants.  OK, fine. Then I read what Dr. Mercola says about the necessity of meat and eggs in one’s diet; I read “The Vegetarian Myth”; and read a lot about Paleo eating. They ALL make perfect sense. Now I read about meat and inflammation and I am thoroughly confused. I do not know what to do.  It seems that starving is the best option.  Please help.  Hi Victoria,When you are evaluating nutrition advice, look closely at the credentials of the person who is giving it (as well as whether or not they might have any particular bias, including those who publish research for organizations that are interested in making money, which may be difficult to discern in some cases).  Did they study nutrition professionally?  As long as I have been a registered dietitian, I have been reading study after study about the various anticancer benefits of plant foods, largely by virtue of their variety of phytonutrients.  These phytonutrients (phyto=plant) are most often very powerful antioxidants that inhibit or reduce the chronic inflammation that can lead to cancers and other diseases.  More and more studies are published every day that show a definite and inarguable link to these phytonutrients and cancer prevention.  Animal foods, however, do not contain phytonutrients.  Instead, they contain injected (and naturally occurring) hormones that have ill effects in the human body, antibiotic and pesticide residues, toxins of all kinds, cholesterol and saturated fat.  When we consume animal foods, we are getting substances that we don’t want, and at the same time we are missing out on the substances we do want, simply by displacement!  The moral of the story is this:  No matter whose advice you choose to follow, a diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes is the foundation of disease prevention, and organic plant foods are especially potent for fighting cancer, another fact that is rapidly gaining recognition in the literature!since I was diagnosed with breast cancer last Nov 2011, I have been on a plant base diet(life-style)…my tumors are gone, some shrunk and no signs of growth. I choose not to have chemo or radiation. After I read the book China Study, Dr Campbell said…Drs dont give women the 4th choice for treatment which is plant base diet…but I did and never looking back. I also want to thank Dr Greger on his web site..lots of great info on everyday health.Psvwyderka, I would love to hear how you are doing now.

I’m doing a little research about the estrogen in milk my self (I’m a vegan nutritionist my self..). I read the article you’re talking about in this video but I was disappointed to find out that they check less then 20 people… so I just can’t take it seriously… Is there any other articles dealing with this question?I have another question, I know that the milk industry claims that Estrogen is collapse until the consumers are drinking it. but i couldn’t find any information about what happens to this destroyed Estrogen, maybe he is still act like Estrogen (and this can also explain the finding on this Japanese study. Oh and your website is just great and really Inspiring :-) Thank you!Kerem, I recommend going through the other videos regarding estrogen and excretion as the questions you posed are answered in Dr. Greger’s videos. http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=estrogenhttp://youtu.be/E-PQCCiw_Zswatch this video,maybe it could help u understand about milkAlso be sure to check out my associated blog post Breast Cancer and Diet!Is there a link betwen baby acne and the hormones in human  breastmilk  being linked to cancer.  Both my children had baby acne as newborns and I wonder if there are increased hormones in m breastmilk that could lead to an increased risk for breast cancer. Human breast milk is by far the healthiest milk for a baby. The only concern would be what the mother is eating as the substances in other foods, such as dairy, can be a part of the breast milk.Check out these video links on dairy and infants. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-induced-infant-apnea/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-casomorphin-and-crib-death/ http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-casomorphin-and-autism/what about raw﻿ dairy products from grass-fed cows?Great food for baby cows not for humans. Raw dairy can be associated with infectious agents. The best way to avoid the myriad of problems associated with dairy products is not to consume them either raw or pasturized. Dr. Greger’s videos on diary and cheese go over these problems in detail. Go to View All Topics and chose between the 79 videos on dairy plus the overview on dairy by Denise on the first page of the dairy videos.Besides dairy free, what other advice you have for acne? I got acne when I went frutarian, now cooked vegan have it.It kinda makes me think, the healthier I ate the worst my acne got! I believe it was a coincidence, but it was a rather funny observation.Nina: That’s too bad. But I have a lot of respect for you. Humans have a hard time believing in coincidence. Sounds like you were able to put some logical perspective on things (and took the logical step of going to a dermatologist).I hope the skin thing clears up for you!hello Dr.Greger, Iam a Pathologist from India and i too m a vegan i agree with everything here but i have one question…these IGF and other growth factors, arent they heat sensitive? dont they get destroyed when subject to high temperatures say during pasteurisation?Dear Dr. Greger,I am suffering from acne for almost 10 years now and I am desperatley searching for some medication / advice that could help me fighting my acne. Since I switched my diet to vegan it is better but not gone.Now I have heard about methylsulfonylmethane as a treatment for acne and seasonal allergic rhinitis, from which I am suffering, too. I could not find articles providing scientific evidence for these promises. Could you please tell me if it works and how it works? I really don’t want to take something without knowing that it can help and that it does not have severe side effects.Kind regards from Germany :)I suffered from back acne for a lot of years and I can testify that when I stopped consuming dairy my back acne improved 50%. Also, I had to take Accutane twice (once at 16 and once at 26) and the only time it worked was when I wasn’t consuming dairy.A 2013 journal article concluded “This analysis of African-American women provides little support for associations of dairy and meat intake with breast cancer risk.”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23329367A 2011 study stated that the “findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that increased consumption of total dairy food, but not milk, may be associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer.”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21442197 Do you have any comments on these studies?well, I think dairy may aggravate the condition in those predisposed. For me, my acne was never bad until this year, Ive been vegan for three years and the past few months have been the worst for me. and i have even tried going oil free. I finally went to the dermatologist to help. Diet is a not a cure for acne, and dairy does cause it can, but I do believe that it can aggravate it if you are so inclined to have it. P.S, for years I had clear skin before I was vegan (probably due to birth control pills which don’t seem to be working now) and during that time I ate badly, lots of meat and dairy and still had beautiful clear skin (though 10lbs overweight!)I gave up on the diet connection. I eat my well rounded vegan diet but i no longer expect miracles from it.Dear Nina, There is definetely more to a healthy skin than just diet, still the diet is one of the main factors that impact it. Vegan is far better than eating meat/dairy products, but there are ways to optimize your vegan diet/ lifestyle to achieve clear skin. I’ve done it myself and I’m very happy to enjoy acne free as well as allergy free skin:) I recommend that you research more on “alkaline diet” and balancing your blood’s pH. We need to keep our blood slightly alkaline (pH>7) for the body to be able to function properly and healthy skin is one of the signs that our internal body environment is functioning well. In general, plant foods are more alkalizing than animal products, but still grains/legumes/some fruits are considered slightly acidyfing to the body, so if your vegan diet consists in big part of grains,legumes and the wrong kind of fruits you may still be overall more acidic. The most important thing to do is to include as many vegatables as you can in your diet, in particular the dark green leafy ones (the most alkalizing foods on earth eg. spinach, kale). Eat a huge salad every day, it can be accompanied by potatoes as this are highly alkaline, too. I could recommend you the book by Karen Fisher “The Healthy Skin Diet”, as the author expalins in more detail what is important to create a beautiful complexion. For me the book has been very helpful when it comes to various skin issues I used to have. However, the book is not about a vegan diet and the presented dietary plan isn’t vegan, but I believe it can be easily adjusted. I used the author’s advice and in circa 2 months of improving my vegan diet I had a clear healthy skin. I continue on eating in this “alkalizing” way with lots of green veggies and smoothies and I can assure you that it isn’t hard to keep up this kind of eating style. In addition, I encourage you to include an excercise regimen (if you don’t have one now) because movement is very important for the blood and particullarly lymph circulation, which both contribute to the effectiveness of you body eliminating harmful metabolites and distributing essential nutrients. Moreover, it’s very important that you are capable of handling your negative thoughts/emotions and any stresses you may have in life as that also greatly impacts your skin. You could do yoga/deep breathing exercises as well as practice some positive affirmations about yourself and your life…may sound weird but it does work to improve your life overall and also to help you achieve the healthy skin you were meant to have. To sum up, I hope you’ll be encouraged to reserach the subjects I’ve brought up a bit further and benefit from it. For me it worked wonders therefore I’d be very happy to help you by sharing this information:)Thank you for taking the time to reply. Those few months of acne were caused by harsh products as I discovered. My skin normalized after following the dermatologist Rx and stopping all the scrubbing and products I was using.I’m glad to read your skin is better. Diet and exercise as Daria mentioned are very important to overall health. Although the only thought I had which is a bit different is that you don’t balance the pH of your blood your body does. By eating consistent with our anatomy and physiology which is that of a vulnerable (at least until we invented weapons) hind gut fermenting herbivore we make it easier for our body to maintain the proper pH by not using alot of our calcium compounds in our bone. The acids come from our metabolism and foods we ingest. Most of the acidity comes from amino acids in proteins. Some of the amino acids tend to be more acidic then others. These sulfur based amino acids tend to be more prevalent in animals but are also present in plants. You can view more about specific amino acids such as methionine which is one of the sulfur based amino acids… see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/methionine-restriction-as-a-life-extension. We don’t need to worry about getting enough essential amino acids via protein in our diet if we eat enough calories. Congrats again on solving your skin condition.have u myb tried tea tree oil?and turmeric…both good topicals for acneCows are great mothers. Each one loads her milk up with 5-alpha-pregnanedione and other hormones to help her baby pack on 500 pounds.

Is that a fair assessment?Though it was a case report (and so by definition described only a single patient), it is consistent with data going back more than 50 years, when researchers in Finland blamed the consumption of milk from cows grazing on cruciferous plants for contributing to the national epidemic of goiter. Don’t get me wrong, I recommend everyone eat greens every day (except those on the drug coumadin who should first ask their physician about re-titrating their dose). Greens are probably the healthiest foods on the planet–but a thousand cups is too much!Can you explain further why the drug coumadin would react with kale. If someone has too much iron in their blood, haemochromotosis, would they suffer from eating kale. Is there an immediate reaction to too much kale or is it a slow build-up in the blood system that would create symptoms? thanks ps – kale chips are on the way!Great questions–seriously! One can eat dark green leafy vegetables while one is on Coumadin; one just has to titrate their greens consumption to their Coumadin dose. Coumadin (a.k.a. warfarin, a.k.a. rat poison) is a blood thinner that works by interfering with the action of vitamin K. So if all the sudden you eat lots of greens (excellent sources of K) you can overwhelm the drug’s ability to keep it from clotting your blood normally. So we should all be eating lots of greens; folks on coumadin just need to keep their greens consumption relatively stable and make sure their physician matches that level of consumption with the appropriate dose. Or even better, one can eat a healthy diet and help avoid the kinds of conditions (like heart attacks) that might lead to one having to take these sorts of drugs in the first place! :)And no, one does not have to worry about plant-based sources of iron in terms of iron overload since your body is able to restrict absorption. Blood-based (“heme”) iron is absorbed whether our body likes it or not, however, and can indeed contribute to the development of that iron overload disease in susceptible individuals. Eat your kale! More about iron here.And I can’t wait for the chips! For those that missed it, I’m offering to mail a complimentary copy of my latest DVD to anyone who sends me (address here) their very own homemade kale chips–now that’s what I call veggie booty! :)The oven is on! Seriously Dr. Greger, I’ve been on Synthroid for 30 years (since age 37) so do I need to worry about iodine and thyroid function? I’m well controlled on medication. I don’t do salt, so my source of iodine is what’s in the liquid from Eden Organic NAS beans. Thanks.I have yet to make kale chips successfully. Can anyone direct me to a good reliable and tasty recipe?1 C raw cashews 1 red bell pepper 1 small/roma tomato 1/8 cup lemon juice 1/4 C nutritional yeast 1/8 tsp salt or to taste pepper to tasteBlend in high-speed blender. Coat kale leaves with blended mixture. Dry in dehydrator.Adjust all ingredients to your taste – e.g., if you like it tangier, use more lemon juice.Dr. Greger: Do you consider 10 cups of cruciferous to much at day? Is there a link between them and inflammation?According to this study published in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 10 cups a day on a regular basis is probably the limit for raw kale–my second favorite vegetable!Please tell what is your favorite vegetable? You can’t leave us hanging!! Also is that cooked or raw?I would also like to know why kale is not your favorite vegetable and what is?According to the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture database, 10 cups of kale is like 670 grams. I double any human can eat so much on a daily basis.I just “discovered” your site ! really enjoy the videos. It just made me think of all the euphoria there is with drinking green smoothies and juices lately ( which I love) how much is too much kale for example in one day? and will doing a one month or two month juice fast for example be harmful in the long run if too many greens are used?Please see my kale response to walfaro immediately above–thanks for your question!Interesting video. I am wondering if you are familiar with the Wahls diet (http://youtu.be/KLjgBLwH3Wc or http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Wahls-Foundation/150956531629073?sk=app_208412272531040 ) and if so do you believe given the information that you researched that she is recommending too many greens?I’m not familiar with Dr. Wahl’s dietary recommendations, but I liked her recent commentary on self-empowerment in the Journal of General Internal Medicine (one of my favorite journals): The Seventy Percent Solution.Wow! What a great read.Also, please check out my associated blog post: http://nutritionfacts.org/blog/2012/04/12/the-best-detox/!Please check out my associated blog post, The Best Detox! My husband and I have begun drinking green smoothies containing raw kale…maybe 1/2 a bunch or more in the vitamix along with fruit to make it more palatable. We really feel this is a easy way to get greens consistently into our diet. By the way, we are totally convinced that whole food, plant-based is the healthiest form of diet. No need to convince us of that. My question is, since my husband (age 71) is on thyroid medication should he avoid completely all forms of raw cruciferous vegetables?Certain veggies, especially the cruciferous veggies, contain natural chemicals called goitrogens that can interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis. Other foods that contain these chemicals include corn, sweet potatoes, lima beans, turnips, peanuts, cassava, and soybeans.Most of these goitrogens are not of any real significance unless they are consumed in very large amounts or there is coexisting iodine deficiency. So, while it is theoretically possible for someone to consume enough of these foods that they may have an effect, for most people it is not an issue. However, when consumed raw, as part of a smoothie, there is the possibility of there being an impact from them, especially if the person is consuming several of these smoothies a day. These goitrogens are inactivated by cooking, even by light steaming, so there is no need to forego them when consumed in that style.Rami, are goitrogens in soybeans and sweet potatoes, etc. also inactivated by cooking? How about peanuts, which are not steamed, but roasted?Generally yes, but this is only a concern for those with pre existing thyroid conditions. I would not worry about it otherwise.Goitrogens are chemicals in food such as kale, cruciferous vegetables and soybeans. Many, but not all, green vegetables contain some levels of goitrogens. Even when eaten frequently, foods containing goitrogens will not cause thyroid disease in healthy people. You need only monitor goitrogen intake after you have been diagnosed with thyroid disease. Kale and green vegetables are very healthy foods, rich in nutrients, and do not need to be avoided completely. If you have thyroid disease, continue to eat these foods cooked. Dietary guidelines given by your doctor should take precedence…..Mr. GhandiYou have echoed my responseDear Dr. Greger, Thank you for the brilliant posts on this subject. Several years back I published a paper [Food Alone May Not Provide Sufficient Micronutrients for Preventing Deficiency] open access http://www.jissn.com/content/3/1/51  I performed diet analysis on 10-men & 10-women according to actual weighed foods they consumed over 3-7-day periods. None of the 20-healthy subjects were consuming near the reference range iodine levels. It was the only micronutrient 100% were deficient. I declare 20-healthy randomly chosen subjects do not represent the whole. It is this note that asks if the potential cause for many disease have a dietary component complexly resulting in hypothyroidism in large populations? We would enjoy hearing your view… Bill Misner Hello Dr. Bill, Dr. Greger addresses the iodine concern in a couple videos. These videos may answer your question. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2/Please research the Gap’s diet for clearing up adrenal and thyroid related issues!!There has been no scientific studies/research done on the GAPS diet. Any evidence that it “clears up” adrenal and thyroid issues is purely anectdotal. 85% of the GAPS diet is made out of meats, fish, eggs, fermented dairy and vegetables (some well-cooked, some fermented and some raw). This diet is too high in saturated fat and cholesterol to be healthy.Good point Dr. Sanchez, but I think that vademonbreun is saying what you are (to a point) that there are no scientific studies on the GAPS diet, and that someone should conduct some studies to determine its effects on adrenal and thyroid health.I, for one, wish that there were a site similar to this one on thyroid health. From my few forays into researching thyroid health it seems that, just like in the health and wellness nutrition field, there is a lot of bunky claims being made often to people who are quite desperate for relief.It frightens me that doctors are still afraid of saturated fat (the healthy kind). I lost 50 pounds and all my health markers increased when I started consuming fat for 70% of my daily diet. Please don’t go off what you learned in school. Take some time to research.Dr. Greger, is there any danger in consuming too much greens because of vitamin K. Almost all green leafy food easily contain daily dosages – and vitamin K is said to have an impact on blood clotting..My husband and I recently depressed our thyroid function by juicing a large handful of fresh kale from my garden every day with our smoothies. After 4 or 5 weeks of daily juicing we began to lose energy and stamina, and developed brain fog. When we complained to our primary care doc he drew blood and discovered that our TSH was high and free T4 was low. I should mention that we didn’t have much iodine in our diets. We started eating dulse and a little seaweed salad every day for iodine and left off the kale–we are recovered now after about a month….who knew?!Wow, That must have been quite the experience for you guys! Glad that you were able to adjust your diet and recover rather quickly it sounds like.As someone with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, I have read that raw kale and other raw cruciferous veggies can have goitrogenic effects on the thyroid (the ability to cause a goiter and slow down the thyroid, much like anti-thyroid drugs do), and can even affect the absorption of synthetic thyroid hormone medicaiton. Apparently, raw juicing goitrogenic vegetables ends up providing especially high concentrations of goiter-promoting ingredients.Luckily, I have also read and been informed that the enzymes involved in the formation of goitrogenic substances in some plant foods can be partially destroyed by heat. Which is a good thing b/c that means that these yummy health foods can still be eaten if they are steamed or cooked. And, even in moderation in there raw form.How much kale did each one of you have daily?Почему без титров? =( печаль какая то выходитCan an overdose of raw cruciferous vegetables (kale, collards, etc.) in smoothies cause the feeling of serious acid-burn tongue similar to same from overload of raw pineapple, but lasting for a week? Is there any ingredient we could add to the smoothie that would neutralize this effect? Any cure besides the tincture of time and time off those smoothies?Hi, Dr. Greger, I recently adopted a whole, plant-based vegan diet after years of reading the research. However, I have Hashimoto’s Disease and regularly take levothyroxine to mitigate the effects of this. Lately, my TSH levels have gone back up — have you seen any evidence to suggest that the addition of raw greens in smoothies could produce this? I am also a green tea drinker in the morning and am wondering if this could all be interacting. Any advice you may have to give would be greatly appreciated! Thank you, NH Girlctrl-F search on this page for “TSH” the answer is, more Iodine and cook or skip certain veggies.When I vitamix-juice, I juice 1 pound of spinach, 1/4 pound of kale, 1-1.5 pounds of berries and sometimes add chia seeds and/or parsley. I drink this over about 8-12 hours. Is this too much?So, Dr. Greger, would you recommend against drinking raw kale juice regularly? Thank you.dr. Greger, I currently am on armor thyroid, since I had a complete thyroidectomy ten years ago. Just started sprouting broccoli and i eat a lot of homemade kale chips. do you see a problem with eating about a quarter cup of broccoli sprout and a cup of kale chips a day. I have a great recipe for kale chips which includes miso, nutritional yeast and turmeric.I juice daily, so always add a double handful of kale, spinach or another leafy green veg. I read somewhere that revolving your cruciferous vegetables can minimise any side effects, so I use a different handful every day. But it seems I could be wrong! I must check on your iodine posts.If 10 cups of greens is ok, does it matter wether it is juiced or eaten as a salad or steamed?The study included 293 cases of thyroid cancer and 354 population controls. We found that high consumption of cruciferous vegetables was associated with thyroid cancer among women with low iodine intake (OR=1.86; 95% CI: 1.01-3.43 for iodine intake < 96 µg/day). The high consumption of cruciferous vegetables among Melanesian women, a group with mild iodine deficiency, may contribute to explain the exceptionally high incidence of thyroid cancer in this group.http://www.hal.inserm.fr/docs/00/47/13/39/PDF/dietary_factors_in_thyroid_cancer_20100308_CCC_R1.pdfI am hoping you can provide more info on which plants contain more of these compounds than others… My wife loves arugula what would the daily limit be?Thank you, Dr. Greger, for your contributions here on NutritionFacts.org. Great stuff. I’ve been consuming one or two small bunches of watercress daily since I read about how it helps with exercise recovery. How much watercress would be too much? Would eating dulse seaweed help balance it’s goitrogenic effect?Can you tell me if there are any true studies showing the danger of too much kale comsumption and excessive thallium intake?Please see link below pertaining to the idea: http://www.care2.com/greenliving/could-kale-be-poisoning-you.htmlThank you!Me too.

Hm. I’m a vegan “nutritarian” in the Joel Fuhrman mold. I track my nutritional intake and my copper intake is always 300-500% the RDI. Should I be worried? Mushrooms are very high in copper; I try to have about 100 g a day because they are so high in lysine and B vitamins. Or should I just hope that copper from plants is not well absorbed, so despite the megadoses of copper I am getting, it won’t lead to trouble down the road?I, too, am a nutritarian and would like to know if you’ve found an answer to this questionIs there an RDA for copper or just an RDI?RDA for Copper is 900-1,000mcg for adults with an upper limit of 10,000mcg. There has been research supporting theory that copper reduces the bodies ability to clear away toxic proteins in the grain, encouraging clumping. Over time, this could result in Alzheimers. Copper is prevalent in liver, oysters, nuts and seeds, some grains and many nutritarian foods. I agree with DrDon that the human body has mechanisms to avoid problems with copper unless exposure to a large amount over time. #Copper, #AlzheimersI saw this video about the same time that I took a trip to our local farmer’s market. I asked a person in one booth whether or not his food was organic. He said “such and such is, but such and such is not, but we don’t add pesticides”. I wanted to be clear, and used a phrase that I had seen in another booth: “Oh, you are spray-free?” He said, “No, nobody is spray-free. Nothing would grow if we were spray-free. We just use organically approved sprays, such as copper.”Then I saw this video about copper and a potential link to altzheimers. Any thoughts about how much copper is in organic foods and whether or not this should be a concern? And if so, are some organic crops given more copper than others???Thanks!I don’t worry too much about the amount of copper in organic fruits and vegetables. The human body has mechanisms to avoid problems with copper unless exposure to a large amount over time or in the case of Wilson’s Disease( a rare inherited condition that causes build up of copper in the body).JJ, that is disturbing information. I did a Google search and found that indeed, copper spraying is a standard organic agricultural practice. Many of our water pipes are also made of copper. Zinc, commonly deficient in vegans, helps keep copper levels from getting too high… Dr. Gregor, what are your thoughts on this? Do you know if we should be concerned here?Dr. Greger, what about copper IUD’s? I can’t find any studies about this this; just anecdotal information. I’m thinking about getting mine removed because of the copper toxicity issue, though I have no other pressing reason to do so. :(All forms of contraception contain risk and have to weighed against the risk of pregnancy. I also couldn’t find any studies on it. There is a free online review article on the copper IUD’s available through PubMed if you are interested. The article is by Bliss Kaneshiro and Tod Aeby, Long-term safety, efficacy, and patient acceptability of the intrauterine Copper T-380A contraceptive device Int J Womens Health. 2010; 2: 211–220. The article doesn’t mention any systemic difficulties with the copper. Hope this helps. Be well.I found this paper: “Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia in developing countries: prevalence, management, and risk factors” published in The Lancet in 2008 and it has a map showing distribution of Alzheimer’s Disease in the world. It does show that it’s low in India and a few other places but the authors of this paper describe it as being absent in the developing countries, which is clearly not the case. I’m confused. These authors got their information from a paper by Waldman and Lamb. I guess I’ll try and track that down.Dr Greger:  Love the site and love the info–it’s inspiring my wife and me to make healthier choices (we’re both long time vegans for moral reasons).  I’m concerned about how strongly you state that Alzheimer’s is a first world problem or one that did not exist prior to 100 years ago.  I can’t imagine the level of evidence that would be required to back up such strong assertions.  My wife’s Grandmother died of Alzheimer’s.  She was born and raised in Trinidad and was a life time lacto vegetarian.  Her family moved her to Canada for medical care when she was in her 70s because she had become senile and was unable to live on her own.  In Canada she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.   It’s not unheard of for elderly people in Trinidad who have limited access to medical care to become senile.  Many of them probably have undiagnosed Alzheimer’s.  Correction on the diet listed above–I got the sides of the family mixed up.  My paternal Grandmother in law was not a vegetarian.  Also, please check out my associated blog post: http://nutritionfacts.org/blog/2012/03/15/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/!For some context, please check out my associated blog post Harvard’s Meat and Mortality Studies!Regulation of Brain Iron and Copper Homeostasis by Brain Barrier Systems: Implication in Neurodegenerative Diseases.Pharmacol Ther. 2012 February; 133(2): 177–188. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3268876/Some critics of veganism say that vegan diets have too much copper (potentially leading to copper toxicity) and also that there is not enough zinc in vegan diets to offset the copper intake. Is there any validity to this?is there a significantly higher concentration of copper in low quality meat products versus “good” quality meats?all heavy metals can lead to increased oxidative stress in the brain, not just copper. Aluminum is also much more prevalent in our environment. Some believe it due to chemtrails where aluminum and barium particulates are sprayed into the air. Also, vaccines and antiperspirants contain aluminum. Seems like all diseases are caused by eating meat, according you Dr. Greger. Since meat is higher in zinc, it may also help to chelate excess copper from our bodies. Meat is not necessary to do this, other foods are high in zinc, such as oysters, pumpkin seeds and dark chocolate. Personally, I take supplements. Zinc is necessary to rid the body of excess copper and excess heavy metals. Glutathione also protects us from heavy metals.Just published:Singh, Itender, et al. “Low levels of copper disrupt brain amyloid-β homeostasis by altering its production and clearance.” PNAS 110.36 (2013): 14771-14776.PDFhttp://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-10753/the-surprising-ways-grains-are-destroying-your-brain.html This article says to drastically reduce carbohydrates in our diet to avoid dementia. This would of course mean increasing meat intake in order to get adequate calories. How do I know if this research is valid? How do we know it’s not just PROCESSED grains that are harmful? If I keep eating my steal cut oats with flax and fruit and avoid flour and sugar produces, will I really still be at risk for Alzheimer’s? I get 60-80% of my calories from carbs. Often I’m eating 10x the amount of carbs this MD suggests. And perhaps the issue is really our omega fatty acid balance. We know our diets are too high in Omega 6 and lacking Omega 3. This doctor has me puzzled. I do avoid gluten. But only because I did an ellimination diet and found out it triggers my excema. For those who are not allergic to it (sure wish I wasn’t) I think wheat can be a totally wholesome food. Also, he talks about aerobics, but what about weight lifting? How can we do that much aerobic exercise without carbs? And resistance training is just as important isn’t it? Aerobics without weights could cause us to have a lower metabolism, couldn’t it? And if we ever went back to eating carbs we would likely start putting on the pounds. That’s definitely a health risk. What would be a helpful way for me to interperate this article? Thank you for your help!!Teale Niles: I highly recommend that you take a look at the book, Power Food For the Brain by Neal Barnard. http://www.amazon.com/Power-Foods-Brain-Effective-Strengthen/dp/1455512192/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1389052678&sr=1-1&keywords=power+foods+for+the+brainDr. Barnard addresses Alzheimers as well as other memory and dementia issues. Dr. Barnard is a very respectable author who has been both studying and doing nutrition research for years and years. I can tell you that he doesn’t tell people to cut back on “carbs”. Also, in addition to diet, the book has a section which addresses physical exercises.Hope that helps!I would stay away from weight lifting as you could get hemoroids. Aerobics is safe, stick mostly to low impact. It does not lower motabolism, but increases the rate at which you will burn calories at rest.I don’t agree — in my view, weight lifting/strength training should be part of one’s exercise program. It has many benefits e.g. strengthening bones, preventing muscle loss, increasing the number of mitochondria in muscles (reudcing odds of insulin resistance), generally increasing the odds one will stay functionally independent as one ages (I’m 68 so that is an issue for me). I have been lifting weights for decades and never had a problem of it causing hemorrhoids. Of course one should exercise within one’s tolerance and use proper technique, which means **not holding one’s breath”. Beginners should get instruction in proper technique and advice on a sensible program.

Lifestyles in the Blue Zones probably don't include too many of those products. To eliminate as many DOC's as possible is it worth it to ride into the ""Blue"" on a plant-based diet?

But I´m a planteater myself and found this highly valuable supporting my own values. Do you think that it is possible to save her without getting through chemo, and putting her on strict diet and lifestyle?Doc, I hope you can comment on the recent study published in the journal of nutrition (J Nutr. 2012 Jun;142(6):1074-80.) contradicting the previous NIH-AARP findings. I would like to see how you deal with it. Here is the link http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22535761I am a CML patient for about 11 yrs and soon will undergo transplant. Can you suggest food that I should be eating more of. I have been a vegan for the last 1 year and always regret why I haven’t consider going vegan earlier. Your website have been very helpful for over the years. Thank you for all your videos and discussions.Shaila, I’m not a doctor and don’t have specific recommendations for you. However, I thought I would note that a whole plant food based diet seems to be very good for making a healthy immune system. Surely that would be a good idea for someone facing a transplant.I just wanted to wish you good luck with your procedure. And to say that I am totally with you on your thought about, why didn’t I go vegan earlier!? I sure wish I had.Best of luck to you.I have MGUS. I’ve gone on a plant based low fat high starch diet and feel great but its always like the sword of Damocles with the possibility of Multiple Myeloma hanging over me.

Im not sure but it’s been since I stopped eating lot’s of white bread and switched to brown and I also drink 4-5 cups of coffee a day and eat a far amount of pasta (brown). Any ideas Michael? CheersPerhaps you should not drink so much coffee. Caffeine is not a health promoting substance.Mouth ulcers are a challenge. The studies show clear link to milk products. People due have reactions to plant foods which can be difficult to figure out. Dr. McDougall’s December 2002 newsletter(available for free on website) contains an article, Diet for the Desperate. Below is a quote from that article which talks about the plant foods most likely to cause allergic problems. Hopefully by now the problem has vanished and is no longer an issue but if the problem has persisted you might consider avoiding some of these foods. “If the elimination diet seems too severe for you right now, then follow the McDougall Program, which eliminates six of the leading causes of food allergies: dairy products, eggs, chocolate, nuts, shellfish, and fish. If your problems persist, then the next suspects to eliminate are wheat, corn, citrus fruits, tomatoes, and strawberries–the most frequent causes of adverse reactions among foods in the vegetable kingdom.”I have found that using a toothpaste without sodium laurel sulfate completely prevents these ulcers. There is clinical evidence for this as well, though I don’t have a citation off the top of my head. Rembrandt made a SLS free toothpaste for this very reason- not sure if they still do. I just look in the “natural” section of my grocery store for a toothpaste with fluoride, but no SLS. Nature’s Gate, Jason, and Trader Joe’s all make them, but you need to read the labels.I have had great success using Rembrandt Canker Sore Toothpaste.  It does not have sodium lauryl sulfate in it.  My local stores no longer carry it so I order it directly from the company.  I think it may also be available on Amazon.  While it is expensive, it is worth the cost to avoid the terrible pain.  I stumbled on it in a magazine article about 10 years ago at my doctor’s office.   Before I found this special toothpaste I had suffered with frequent canker sores for years (since my teens), often with several at once.  They wouldn’t heal on their own but had to be cauterized with silver nitrate sticks I got from my family doctor–a painful process in itself.  I got them whenever I injured the inside of my mouth–biting my lip or cheek or scraping the tissue somehow.  Now I almost never get the sores, and if I do they heal up promptly.  What a relief!  I will consider the milk angle, but since this toothpaste has virtually eliminated my problem I’ll probably just stick with that.  I highly recommend that all canker sore sufferers try Rembrandt’s Canker Sore Toothpaste.  Don’t just look for Rembrandt though–several of their varieties have SLS–get the Canker Sore type!   : )cool thanks I use co-op tooth paste cos it’s vegan but i’ve never read the label properly. Why is coffee bad for you? I gave it up this week and am feeling pretty good for it and I feel like I can think much better too. :-)Its not the coffee bean itself that’s bad for you; it is a bean after all. Check out the video on its health benefits http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-coffee-bad-for-you/ http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/update-on-coffee/But as always, one must weigh out the pros and cons. It has many health benefits but the caffeine itself is not a beneficial substance. It is after all, an unnatural stimulant. Check out these few articles on coffee by Dr. McDougall. http://www.nealhendrickson.com/mcdougall/2004nl/040700pucoffee.htm http://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2005nl/july/050700fav5.htm Drinking 4-5 cups of coffee a day is an extreme amount, since depending on what type you drink, such as filtered, it can have up to 100 mg of caffeine, and the daily limit is 200! You should aim for 2 cups a day max or drink decaf. A much healthier choice would be to drink Decaf Chai Tea http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-healthiest-beverage-2/I’ve suffered with mouth ulcers my entire life.  I’ve never found a dentist or doctor who had an answer to the cause.  Eleven months ago, I started a whole foods, plant-based diet (thus, eliminating all animal and dairy).  I was still getting the mouth ulcers.  In January I was searching the internet for causes for mouth ulcers (as I have done many times before) and found an article about SLS in toothpaste as a cause.  I switched to a natural toothpaste and the ulcers went away.  That is until June when I spent a month traveling Europe.  The interesting thing about this is that I decided not to be plant-based while I traveled (I wanted to eat what the locals eat) and I ate dairy.  I also ran out of my natural toothpaste and switched back to SLS toothpaste for a couple of weeks.  By the time I got home, I had mouth ulcers once again.  So, was it the dairy or was it the toothpaste?  I’m back off of both, so perhaps I will never know for sure, but I suspect it is the SLS in the toothpaste since I was still getting them after several months on a non-dairy diet. They are sooooo painful and frustrating!Not a single canker sore in my mouth since avoiding all dairy years ago. I had forgotten all about them until I saw this video. Pleasant change explained!Dr. Greger,My husband, a sufferer from recurring, painful canker sores, is inclined to try eliminating dairy, after seeing this video. My question: Is cows’ milk the only dairy source that could trigger this condition? Does goat milk have the same negative effect; or could he consume goat milk products in exchange? He is having a hard time giving up cheese…Thank you!~ UteHi, I am Sahithi,i am suffering fro mouth ulser from 2 weeks.I am getting mouth ulcer after eating food made up of chick peas powder,i wonder what is the cause of it.chick peas powder is procesed food like enithing else form modern style life. Try to eat chick peas raw…very healthy!!! ( my experience)Hi everyone, I suffered with these horrible canker sores for years, never knowing what was causing them, a hapless victim of their merciless pain that often lasted for two weeks. Sometimes the pain was so great I could not even sleep or eat normal food. I finally saw a world reknown dermatologist who advised me to eliminate one of the possible food groups that cause them at a time, and for me it was the dairy products. Here’s the thing: I thought I was doing everything right and I was still getting them, until I found out the margarine I was using contained whey which is a dairy product. Ever since then, I began looking at food labels, avoiding the whey and have rarely had a problem. I found that the more concentrated forms of dairy such as butter and cheese were the worst causes, as well as milk chocolate, moreso than regular milk. If you’re searching for a solution as I was, try eliminating ALL dairy from your diet, which you really have to watch food labels (and ask annoying questions at restaurants) to do. Best wishes everyone.Makes sense. I wasn’t vegan til I moved out of my parents house. The whole time at my parents’ house I had recurring mouth ulcers. I thought it was because I started cooking on my own and reduced my salt intake, but this could make sense too! Either way, just another victory of a healthy diet!Would the dairy issue with the body attacking itself ..autoimmune… cause the same problems in the gut.. as in crohns disease? And if so, what is the best way to test to see if your body fights against dairy like this?Michael, I have seen huge progress from that expo in Chicago….just go, an go….I’m 100% on Your side…we have to change the world…and I think we allready did!!!P.S.

The results have been very good! Unfortunately, the dentists I have shared it with are not willing to give it a try. Old habits die hard.Dr. Jones, I would like to chime in here re mouth (tongue) ulcers. I have been vegan for a few years now and was taking 2000 ug B12 once a week. I have also experienced ulcers mostly on my tongue every so often going way back. I also have a history of Crohn’s going back 30 some years. In the past year I started experiencing other symptoms like fuzzy thinking, fatigue, moodiness and just overall yuckiness. Long story short, I kept digging for a solution and the only thing that put it all together was a vitamin B12 deficiency! So, knowing you can’t OD on B12 and that massive oral doses could be just as effective as intramuscular injections, I started taking daily 5000 ug sublingual methylcobalamin. Within two weeks my symptoms cleared up and I haven’t had any tongue ulcers again even though I drink coffee and eat a lot of tomato paste.Lawrence: Great problem solving. Thanks for sharing.Thanks for being here. Dr. Greger and the entire NF Team are a national treasure. For the sake of brevity, I did not mention a confounding factor in my ‘race for the cure’ of my myriad symptoms, that of my recent serum B12 lab work indicating a normal level (568 pg/ml in a range of 239-931). I have come to learn that the serum tests can be misleading for a number of reasons and one needs to see their homocysteine and MMA levels as well, tests that were not ordered at the time. In addition to all the excellent B12 videos here, Dr. Greger has a great lecture on Youtube called ’40 Year Vegan Dies of a Heart Attack’ that is well worth the time of anyone who frequents this website, and especially for vegans. Another outstanding resource is the CDC continuing education course for healthcare professionals on B12 deficiency. It is suitable for lay readers and will assist the public with being more proactive when interfacing with their health care providers who may not know about the myriad problems associated with B12 deficiency and the dangers of misdiagnosis. Here’s a link to the course:www dot cdc dot gov/ncbddd/b12/documents/b12-030910.pdfLawrence: I’ve seen that other Dr. Greger video too! I agree, it’s great.And thanks for the additional info, re: CDC continuing education course.Take care.My son is 11 and for the past 4 years he keeps getting painful red and often bleeding sores on his lips and the edges of his mouth we ruled out lots of things but it seems he gets them especially if he drinks cow milk the kind given out at school or milk i buy at the store after switching him to coconut milk its completely. Stopped why does this happen? What is it called in medical terms it does not happen when he eats cheese or icecreamLike others here i have had apthous sores my whole life. I have eaten dairy my whole life. But when i stopped eating nuts, 30 years ago – no more sores. I still eat dairy. I’d say the immune response like people in general are different.Thank you for this Video Dr Greger. It was quite a revelation to discover that it was caused by dairy. I just did not make the connection between Dairy and Oral health. I am wondering now if some people have a kind of an allergy or an immune system issue which makes them prone to these painful oral health issues more than others, when consuming certain foods. It would be great to see more videos like this, since people with oral health issues tend to have suffered from it for a very long time, even with regular check ups and cleaning they receive from dentists and periodontists .Never been prone to acne but had those apthous sores my entire youth. Do kids showing these sores have higher ADHD prevalence, anybody here privy to this? Scored unusually high 38/40 on a test 20 years back, with all the exorphin talk out there and now this sensitivity linked to milk again. I wonder….. , could I have had a normal life?Is there any link between stomach ulcers and dairy?I am a vegan (vegan 2 years, 6 years vegetarian) who has recently been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease 4 months ago. I have been getting canker sores for the last 4 years, I follow a strict vegan diet and every month I get these sores? Is this related to my Crohns?Hey Sam. Ughh, sorry to hear about the Crohns. Luckily symptoms can be heavily managed sometimes by diet and lifestyle. Not sure about the canker sores or if they are related. A quick search did find some common themes. One study Oral manifestation in inflammatory bowel disease: a review. And another that discusses From aphthous ulcer to full-blown Crohn’s disease. This is a serious condition and I highly suggest discussing diet with your doctor and even seeing a dietitian. There are many herbs, foods, vitamins that may be a good option for you. Let me know if I can do more. I have a few freinds with crohns and anecdotally I can say a few things really triggers flares : refined carbohydrates (soda and fruit juice), some beans (but not many of them), and raw cruciferous veggies. Funny though he dies fine with spicy foods, homemade breads (but not commercially bought), and most all other foods. Very individuals, hence why seeing a dietitian could be super helpful!Best to you, JosephJust returned from Holistic Holiday at Sea. (Great presentations from you, Dr. Greger) One presenter, Dr. Blyweiss, addressed the treatment of Aphthous ulcers as including Lysine and “the clyclovirs”. I can’t remember what he attributed as “cause”, but I hope to receive the powerpoint slides for review soon. All my life, I have gotten random single or double “simple” sores. I usually gargled with salt water and used “Kank-a” (brand) topical solution, which burns it to numbness. About 18 months, several sores erupted simultaneously and then flared into a massive sore that spanned the length of my tongue and gums on one side of my mouth. I have never been in so much pain. It hurt to talk, and eating was out of the question. I sought out an oral specialist, and after careful interviewing and listening and the use of many reference materials, the doc cited the presence of Herpes in my system, due to past diagnoses of Chicken Pocs, Shingles and Mono. He said that the virus remains dormant and then it is activated when immunity is low. While I had already practiced healthful eating (vegan), and he was happy to hear it, I went totally sugar free and took his prescriptive action, which started with a Medral Pak 5-day steroid blast, followed by a group of things: an Rx”Acyclovir” and another Rx for Miracle Mouthwash, and over-the-counter: “Lysine”, “ACHH”, “Colostrum” and “ViraStop” as a full scale treatment. Since that time, my canker sores have appeared about every 4 months. (No regularity, no rhyme/reason) I cannot, for the life of me, figure out a true cause-and-effect for the occurrence of canker sores for me. I get more than one at a time, usually. There is no specific thing I am doing that suddenly brings them on…ie I used to think it was because of a random sugary dessert, but other times, the same dessert does not cause a break out; I have purchased natural, Laurel Sulfate-free toothpaste, and I still get them randomly; I am almost 100% vegan, with only one exception: half-n-half in my daily coffee. (I know that “needs to go” for many reasons), but still, it’s perplexing to me that, if dairy is a culprit, note that I have 1-2 TSB of half-n-half every day in my morning coffee, (for years) and I only randomly get canker sores. Is there any updated information on aphthous sores these days? It has been 5 years since this video… Anything you can present would be greatly appreciated. I have been on another dose of Acyclovir (“every 6 hours”) for about 10 days. The original canker sore on my tongue has gone away, and now I have two more getting started on the roof of my mouth and where my gums attach to my upper lip. I am willing to do anything to make them stop coming. HELP!Hi Christine. Thanks for your comment and glad you were able to connect with Dr. Greger and others on the cruise! I suggest avoiding the dairy for a bit and see if it helps? The association between canker sores and dairy seems to remain.I used to get canker sores when I was little and didn’t consume any dairy products.Now I eat a lot of dairy foods but hardly get any mouth sores anymore.I just hope they don’t come back to haunt me:/","['allergies', 'animal products', 'aphthous ulcers', 'canker sores', 'dairy', 'gluten', 'ice cream', 'immune function', 'milk', 'oral health', 'pain', 'wheat']",A dairy-free diet may stop the recurrence of canker sores.,"For more videos on health concerns related to dairy, check out: Formula for Childhood Obesity Childhood Constipation and Cow’s Milk Prostate Cancer and Organic Milk vs. Almond Milk Cow’s Milk-Induced Infant Apnea Skim Milk and AcnePlease feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and I’d be happy to try to answer them.

I of course found you via PCRM and Neil Barnard who I strongly admire.COMMENT: I noticed that the 5th quintile represented greater or equal to 647 grams per day of fruits and vegetables. Does this include water weight and fiber weight? Measuring by weight alone does seem pretty inaccurate since most of us think in terms of volume when we track and analyze our diets – ie grams and cups and ounces.Most nutrition and calorie charts and sites track by “grams of pinto beans” etc. Plus there is so much fiber and water weight in fruits and veggies. The amount of water in fruits and veggies seems to range from 80 to 96% according to one chart I just found (http://www.ca.uky.edu/enri/pubs/enri129.pdf)CALCULATION: So, if you for a moment assumed that 647 grams by weight of veggies and fruit intake contained all carbs and proteins at 4 cals per gram for example (and NO fiber or water or fats weight – to make the calculation a little easier) – that would equal about 2500 calories per day food intake from 647 grams of pure “carbs and protein” food. (Again this is just for discussion sake).Remove 80% water content from this calculation (not to mention the fiber weight) – and that is only about 700 calories of carbs in 647 grams of veggies and fruits – if you know what I mean. I’m eating a vegan diet and am taking in about 2000 calories per day and my weight is stable. So I am ballparking that I’m probably taking in about 3 times the 647 “gross” grams per day of food – just to get to the 2000 calories per day. So this amounts to about 1950 grams per day of fruits and veggies, since that is all I eat as a vegan. Does this make sense?MY QUESTION IS: how does this 647 grams of fruits and veggies per day translate into an all vegan diet? How many grams per day does a vegan taking in 2000 calories per day amount to? Any studies regarding this much higher level of intake – amounting to 647 x 3 – approx 1950 grams per day – or 69 ounces of fruits and veggies – or roughly 4.3 lbs per day? Wow – that is a lot of weight but probably a good approximation of my total food intake by weight daily. Do my numbers make sense here? About 4.3 lbs per day by weight of food intake for 2000 vegan calories daily.Please also check out my associated blog post Fighting Inflammation with Food SynergyDo you have any specific information on a high carb, low fat, raw vegan diet for weight loss and overall health? Like the one suggested by Dr. Douglas Graham’s “80 10 10″?

I am puzzled about the EPIC result that prostate cancer was not influenced by fruit and vegetable consumption, and the poor showing in general of vegetables and fruits as indicated by the hazard ratios.

They have never been in a hospital for sickness and in 11 years we had one ear infection. However, I am now facing terrible slander because I am giving “dangerous supplements” to my children. I am looking for facts and information that I can put out there to inform the world that the sugar in their kids’ cereal is way more dangerous than Herbalife. I’m not saying they must put their kids on the weight loss program, but a shake or NRG can only benefit the children. Best Regards, LizetteIs it because of overdosing in Herbalife products? Or is it that they contain a toxic ingredient? I would love to get more information about this as I am about to become a distributor and don’t want to encourage people to risk their health. What recommendations would you give me?I don’t generally recommend any supplements except Vitamin B12(see video’s in February 2012 for cost/efficacy/dosing). A low fat plant based diet of whole food that avoids GMO’s is the best place to start. I briefly perused the Herbalife website. I can’t support supplemental protein for any reasons as consumption of adequate calories gives all the essential amino acids you need… asparagus and broccoli have the same amino acid profile as eggs. See Dr. McDougalls articles on protein in his newsletters dated 12/03, 04/07 and 01/04. Mineral supplements are not needed unless specific deficiencies are identified. Many mineral supplements contain copper, zinc and iron which have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease. Products that profess to replace fruit and vegetable intake with a pill isn’t a healthy approach based on current science. Finally it is often impossible to know what all the ingredients are as they are often “proprietary”. Of course the supplements may be an improvement over the foods they replace but why not avoid the supplements, save the money and go for the best scientifically supported diet.Thanks for the information Dr. Forrester, I myself would prefer to go vegan than start relying on such products. However, it seems like some products may help some people (those who refuse to eat healthy) get somewhat healthier. Which supplements do you suggest to avoid?After over 35 years in clinical practice I am a pragmatist and generally support anything that helps folks transition to a better lifestyle especially improved nutrition. I want to be clear that I am aware of no good scientific studies supporting the use of supplements with continuing poor nutrition as the preferred path. There are many supplements out there and there is alot of money being made and wasted on these products. With so many it is hard to get into specific products. I do research specific products for my patients. I generally go to the appropriate website and/or label and look at ingredients and cross reference the ingredients with the information and studies from reliable sources such as Dr. John McDougall, Jeff Novick RD, Dr. Michael Greger and Dr. Neal Barnard. At this point I can’t list any that I recommend. Hope this helps.herbalife uses any performance enhancing drugs or steroids directly or indirectly .

Is there new and or more research suggesting a link between aluminum and Alzheimer’s. The Alzheimer’s Association seems to still be suggesting that it’s a myth. Perhaps it takes a long time or more compelling research to change their recommendations. http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_myths_about_alzheimers.aspThe latest review I’m aware of was published last year in the journal of Alzheimer’s: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20378957. As you can see it remains an unanswered research question. As I noted to JJ below, though, until we know more, it is reasonable to try to decrease our exposure.what about the aluminum in tea? How much is in green tea? Thanks!!!This video ends with: “Every grilled cheese sandwich you give to your kids is like injecting them with a dozen vaccines.”Is this really true?I thought this information was so compelling that I went around telling it to everyone after I first watched it. I was met with a lot of skepticism.So, I tried to do my own research. What I came up with is that only “processed cheeses” have large amounts of aluminum added. According to Wikipedia, a processed cheese is a cheese product that is made *from* normal cheese.I’m sure some parents really do give their kids that processed stuff. However, plenty of parents also are likely to use normal/regular cheese. So, is the ending sentence missing a qualifier word? Ie, should it be: “Every grilled processed cheese sandwich you give to your kids is like injecting them with a dozen vaccines.”Or did I not do enough research? When I tell people this stuff, I want to be accurate. Thanks for any clarifications you can provide.The aluminum is indeed added in the processing, but that is what American cheese is, processed cheese (American cheese is the cellophane-wrapped slice that one typically makes grilled cheese sandwiches out of. In fact that’s why you make grilled cheese sandwiches with American cheese because it melts easy (thanks in part to the added aluminum)). I’m not saying that chronic aluminum ingestion is necessarily pathogenic. The risk of aluminum, as I noted in the video, remains an unanswered research question (see this review http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20378957 last year for example). I do think it’s reasonable, however, until we know more, to try to decrease our exposure.I get that the “American Cheese” brand is “processed cheese”. And it may be true that lots of people use that brand to make grilled cheese sandwiches, but certainly not everyone. My family (not me any more) makes grilled cheese sandwiches only with regular cheese. My family eats lots of regular cheese, but doesn’t touch processed cheese. When I told my mom about how much aluminum she was getting, it was not true. Yes?You didn’t say “processed cheese” anywhere in the video. I just listened to it again for like the 7th time. The words in the video only say “cheese” time and again and the graph also only says “cheese” – meaning that all cheese is given aluminum salts. This is not true from what I am able to determine.I think it is an important distinction to make. I don’t want to run around telling everyone that cheese has all this aluminum when in fact only some “processed”/fake cheese have it and regular cheese does not.Your point about the pathogenic nature of aluminum being unknown is well-taken. As is the part about wanting to limit aluminum in our diet. I think most people would agree with that – which is why I wanted to tell people about this.As something of an aside: I recently got a recipe book called “Uncheese…” (The Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook: Delicious Dairy-Free Cheeses and Classic “Uncheese” Dishes) It has a recipe for “Geez Whiz” which is suppose to be something like processed Cheese Whiz. I haven’t eaten real Cheese Whiz in many years, so I can’t say for sure, however, I think the Geez Whiz is pretty authentic tasting and has an authentic texture – and it is pretty healthy too. I mention this just in case someone wonders if there is a way to get that processed-cheese experience without the aluminum.I’ll have to try that recipe! As noted in the video, if your cheese does not soft, easily melting, and with “desirable” slicing properties than it is unlikely that the dairy industry added aluminum salts to it. I guess the only way to be sure is to contact the company directly (since it is just used in processing they don’t have to list it in the ingredients),I’m amazed at the lengths people will go to avoid a particular substance while ignoring the facts. Cheese, as in all dairy, is harmful. Casein, the protein in dairy, has been proven to cause cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes and heart disease. Dairy is also the cruelest industry on the planet. Maybe the safest, and smartest thing to do is avoid dairy altogether.You know, injecting something directly into the bloodstream is NOT the same as ingesting it. So… it isn’t a fair comparison.Either way, I wouldn’t want to eat that much, though.You’re absolutely right becochic, but in the calculation I took into account the relative bioavailability of the aluminum ingested orally.I use a Body Deodorant Stick called “Crystal” which says it has “No Aluminum Chlorohydrate” but it has Natural Mineral Salts, and Ammonium Alum. What are your thoughts on this form of aluminum?What do you use for deodorant?What about the use of aluminum foil in cooking, such as lining a baking pan with aluminum foil when roasting, or wrapping it around corn to cook on the grill; thoughts?CHEMICALS ARE NOT SAFE IN INJECTIONS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE IN FOOD Medical students learn that substances behave differently when they are injected or ingested – why do so many appear to forget this basic fact?EVEN WATER IS NOT SAFE WHEN IT IS INJECTED As with other substances, water behaves differently when injected, in fact it is dangerous. Injections containing only water should never be administered because they cause irreversible damage: hemolysis/bursting of blood cells.That is why if injection of water is required it must be mixed with another substance to regulate isotonicity so that blood cells will not be damaged. One example of a substance which is often used for this purpose is sodium chloride. An injection of 0.9 per cent sodium choride is ideal as it presents least damage to blood cells.Thankyou Sandy for clarifying this, I was about to lose my mind b/c my daughter as a toddler ate a slice of cheese every day. She hasnt in a long time, but here i am thinking she is going to get some kind of cancer or alzheimers!I’m having trouble scrolling through the comment thread, I can only see the top one and cannot scroll through the rest, it just doesn’t move. I do not eat the “cheese food” slices at all as I consider it to be fake cheese.  But I do get other types of cheese with food such as the white cheese on a pizza or the feta in a greek salad for example.  Am I getting aluminum poisoned?  After watching the video I got the idea that I need to eliminate all types of cheese, but the comments suggest otherwise. Non “processed” cheeses may be less likely to have aluminum which is a worry and should be minimized. There are however many other reasons to avoid cheese which is highly calorie dense, contributing to obesity, contains cholesterol & saturated fat, contributing to arterial disease, and contains chemicals such as dioxin see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-the-food-supply to the risk of cancer and hormonal considerations. In children dairy products have been associated with early onset of puberty (something I believe most parents would like to delay for reasons along with the health benefits of delayed puberty) see…http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/.Interesting how you did not mention the Rotterdam Heart Study which showed that eating hard cheeses was associated with a 57% decrease in cardiovascular events. Show me any other action that can lower heart risks by over 50%! Your vegan agenda is evident in your choice of data to highlight.The current science supports a whole food plant based nonGMO diet with adequate B12 intake. This is consistent with our biological design as “hind gut” fermenting herbivores. Beyond human health there is also the environmental impact of raising animals not to mention the suffering involved… not only the animals but the workers in the associated industries. So I guess my “agenda” would be more aptly labeled “global health”. Back to the study… I’m not sure I have reviewed that particularly study but would be glad to if you sent me the link… a quick pubmed search didn’t turn it up. Most studies that are used by folks to support their beliefs that consumption of animal products are beneficial are usually poorly done, relative studies and/or cite statistics without understanding. The saying, “s/he uses statistics like a lamp post more for support than illumination” comes to mind. In my CME talks with clinicians I recommend three references: first, Dr. Gilbert Welsh’s presentation, “Two Most Misleading Numbers in Medicine” available for free on the McDougall website under free lectures; second read the Nordic Cochrane Collaboration pamphlet, Screening for Breast Cancer with Mammography; and third, Dr. Goetzche’s book, Mammography Screening: Truth, Lies and Controversy which details all the studies done and is a great introduction to the practical issues of interpreting clinical studies. The most frequently cited CV study is the Lyons Heart Study which is an example of an intervention which showed improvement over the control group. That doesn’t make it the best intervention. Another study that comes to mind is the DASH study. I think it is important for clinicians to make sure that their patients are prescribed the best approaches and not a better approach (e.g. Barnard diet over American Diabetic Assn. Diet, Esselstyn(not Ornish) over the American Heart Assn. diet). I’ll look forward to the link.I agree with Don below, the study link would be useful in analyzing its applicability.Dr Greger,Do you know if veggie “cheese” such as Veggie Shreds/Slices has aluminum added so that it will melt easily?Thanks,Veggie “cheese” is made from soy. A huge amount of soy is genetically engineered with organisms from another species so that it resists incessant spraying with as many as three different and very toxic weed killers. I’ve never seen any certified organic veggie cheese.I need some advice on what to do about my teeth…Have them gold plated and have your initials tatood on your gumsI would like to know if you have an opinion on the dangers of using aluminum  cookware.   I have a lovely old-fashioned silver-plated aluminum teapot which my mother brought from England in the 50`s.  I love this little pot but barely use it because I’m worried about the connection to alzheimers.  I am vegan so don’t load my body down with animal product toxins so I’m hoping that perhaps my body can handle low levels of aluminum.  Is there a “safe” level to ingest on a daily basis. Hey TinaDespite what you’ll hear from fad diet book authors and internet bloggers, the world of science doesn’t drastically change it’s opinion on important matters very often at all. There’s always the odd scientist that likes to bend the truth of course or out right lie even.Sometimes things will be called harmless, later to be called harmful. Sometimes things will be called harmless and then later found to be healthful, but not many things make the leap from harmful to healthful.Often research is said to say something it doesn’t in the media. Like how tea and coffee were said to be dehydrating when really the studies were looking at strong caffeine tablets.Smoking will never be good for you. Neither will a steak unless you’re starving or not taking a B12 supplement. Fibre and antioxidants will never be harmful unless we conduct an experiment with unrealistic amounts of them perhaps. Maybe we’ll one day discover that fibre and antioxidants aren’t as healthful as we thought. Might turn out to be something else in the fibre, antioxidant rich foods that’s helping, but whatever it is, we still know looking for fibre, antioxidant rich foods is a good idea.Dr, I am a bit confused. The aluminium in vaccines enters the blood directly bypassing all the body’s defenses where as in the case of cookware, cheese, etc, it enters the body but through regular entry points. Surely the body can deal with aluminium differently if it enters through the mouth instead of in the vein directly. Kindly help. ThanksI did indeed take reduced oral bioavailability into account when I made the calculation–thanks for your question!Dr. Greger, do you think that most organic cheeses do not have anywhere near the aluminum?My friends over in the paleobubble of course say that seeds are trying to kill us all — and soy is especially bad because it has aluminum, aluminum I say! Will I get Alzheimers if I eat organic edamame or drink organic soy milk? [No more than 2-5 servings/day per your excellent video re how much soy is too much, which also does not mention the Al-soy angle.]Aluminum has been implicated in Alzheimer’s Disease but so have copper, iron, zinc and mercury. Saturated fat and cholesterol are also associated with increased incidence of dementia(multi-stroke and Alzheimer’s Disease). On the positive side to avoid these conditions getting regular physical exercise, adequate sleep, mental exercises and plant based sources of certain vitamins… E, Folate, B6 and B12. You need to avoid taking supplements as the fat soluble vitamins A and E have been associated with increase morbidity and mortality…. see video http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-vitamin-supplements/ and more recently see… http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-vitamin-e/ . By avoiding supplements you will also most likely avoid iron, zinc and copper as many multivits have those as well. You should also view the videos on Alzheimer’s Disease on Nutritionfacts.org see… http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-theory-of-alzheimers/. Pulling all this together is the upcoming book, Power Foods for the Brain by Neal Barnard which will be available on Amazon next month. Bottom line I would worry about the minerals in nuts and seeds when taken in moderate amounts such as 1-2 oz per day.You mention that you would worry about the minerals in nuts and seeds when taken in moderate amounts (1-2 oz. per day). It seems to me that moderate servings of some beans match similar amounts of minerals as do these nuts and seeds. Would you suggest worrying about the minerals in these beans?I imagine that Dr. Forreser meant to say that he *wouldn’t* worry about nuts and seeds in moderate amounts. Am I wrong?I would tend to agree with Lyra’s reading of Dr. Forrester’s comments. Also, nuts and beans are high in phytic acid which binds to minerals, such as aluminum which reduces their bioavailability…Also another key takeaway from Dr. Forrester’s comments is more recent studies showing that vascular issues (his reference to saturated fat and cholesterol) may be a significant contributor to the development of dementia.Thanks for the additional comments. I corrected my post re: nuts.Lyra… Thanks for catching my error. I corrected it.How can eating something be compared to injecting something? I’d think an injection which doesn’t not get broken down, but goes directly into our blood must me more potent.Hi Shari, you are correct and indeed scientists have been able to measure the difference in bioavailability of aluminum through injection versus ingestion. The study that Dr. Greger cites, focuses on this very issue. You can find this study under “Sources Cited”, below the video.We use BPA free canned beans for ease. I’m glad it’s BPA free, but what about the aluminum getting into our food and increased risk of things like Alzheimer’s?(Not to mention that I’m guessing that since BPA has to do with plastic, that a plastic coating is what is in direct contact with the food. I’m concerned about the leaching here as well.)Is it worth the time and effort to be cooking large batches of bulk beans and freezing them?I believe the can is steel.Is the aluminum in only processed cheese or in all hard cheeses?can you comment on the effects of the aluminum in titanium implants?Could this be a cause of migraines in people that get them from eating cheese?Dr. Neal Barnard speaking on PBS, said that aluminum sulfate is used by municipal water treatment plants as a clarifying agent for water that comes out of the tap. He suggested purchasing and installing a Reverse Osmosis Filter in order to protect your brain from the Aluminum. I have yet to purchase an RO filter, but I have found that eating more blueberries seems to sharpen my cognitive ability.What about immunotherapy for allergies? People get several shots a month containing aluminum hydroxide. It worried me so I stopped my therapy. And I’m happy I’m not eating a sandwich with cheese every day, like I used to.Aluminum has no known biological function in the body. Our bodies have the ability to excrete Aluminum through our kidneys. Aluminum is poorly absorbed by GI tract so we are somewhat protected. Direct injections by pass that protection. The key issue is the amount since our bodies will get rid of it. It can accumulate so it is best avoided or minimized. Dr. Greger’s video does a nice job at providing the relative intakes given various sources. Clinically it depends on the risks/benefits. Congratulations on moving beyond cheese.what kind of cheese? all cheeses?Your opinion on whether to have a vaccine, such as for flu and shingles?Do all cheeses contain aluminum? What about cream cheese, mozzarella and cheese made from organic milk?Not all cheese, just processed cheese such as the kraft cheese squares. There is more to cheese then just aluminum though. Check out this video http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dairy-sexual-precocity/A lot of the confusion about proper diet comes from the assumption that there is ONE diet that is best for EVERYONE. Roger Williams documented the wide variety of structures and functioning in our human species. Scientists like Pottenger, Kelley, Watson, Wolcott, have gone on to show that diets based on ones’ metabolic or oxidative type prove to be more useful than just prescribing ONE diet for EVERYONE. Example: Parasympathetic dominants tend of have overly alkaline blood pH. Eating the “healthy” way with lots of fruits and veggies drives their ph even higher, further away from the optimum pH of 7.46, making them feel worse, whereas Sympathetic dominants have more acidic blood and need the fruits and veggies to bring their blood pH up to 7.46. Find out more about metabolic typing and you’ll find out what your body specifically needs.Any studies to back your claims?I can list several sources of information which if you want to check their references you can find sources for the above statements. To look through and list sources for these statements would take more time than I have for a casual statement in a blog. Biochemical Individuality by Roger Williams (sample reference: Motulsky A. Human genetic variation and nutrition. Am J Clin Nutrition 1987, 45:1108-1113). Metabolic Typing by William L. Wolcott. Nutrition and Physical Degeneration by Weston A. Price. The Nutrition Solution: A Guide to Your Metabolic Type by Harold J. Kristal. One Man Alone by Nicholas Gonzalez, MD.Its difficult to come to our own conclusions based on the opinions of other authors. I would like some solid evidence.Well I would like the tea party Republicans to quit holding the congress and the American people hostage, but it doesn’t look like that’s going to happen. If you want some solid evidence you’re going to have to look it up and read it for yourself. I’ve given you some reference books with medical references in them to begin with. These are not just author opinions put into print. I’m not going to do your work for you – you wouldn’t believe me or my references anyway if I wrote something that conflicts with your already preconceived paradigm of the one best diet for mankind. I have studied human nutrition for many decades and have yet to come up with a unified nutrition theory that explains it all but I firmly believe that the variability in structure and function of the human species is best served by a variety of diets that are individualized.Humzee: While I can’t say anything definitively about the particular diets you are talking about, I did want to say that this sounds an awful lot like the “diet for your blood type” – which is simply wrong.The reason I feel comfortable saying anything at all about your comment is that this site alone provides such strong evidence that (baring a genetic deficiency), there really is one basic diet that applies equally well to the vast majority of humans.It would sure take a whole lot of evidence to over shadow the current mountain of evidence we currently have. I encourage you to take a look at the great information on this site.There are many “typing” systems out there that attempt to tailor diets to specific populations: blood typing, ayurvedic doshas, metabolic typing oxidative typing, etc. some more useful than others. I agree with the inaccuracies of the blood typing system. The other three mentioned have proven to be more useful. They are based on a person’s individual biochemical and physiological make-up. I have studied the hunter-gatherer diet as put forth by Cordain and others and have come to the conclusion that it works well for those with a parasympathetic nervous system dominance (or protein types as they are sometimes called) and it is a disaster for those with a sympathetic nervous system dominance. As an example Dr. Robert Atkins used a variation of the paleo diet to treat a wide variety of ailments quite successfully but dropped his cancer treatment program using the same because of dismal results. The paleo approach works best with parasympathetic dominant types and poorly with sympathetic dominants who need a more plant based diet. You can check any of the work by Nicholas Gonzalez or William Donald Kelley who used this approach to achieve the best results known to modern medicine in treating cancer.Hi Humzee, So happy you have found this site…you sound super smart and like you have done a lot of research on nutrition :)) All I would say is to exercise caution when reading the work on anyone who is practicing medicine for profit and not thinking about the best interests of the patient. Check out Kelly and Gonzales about 1/2 way down on this link http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/cancer.html Hugs :))Hi Jen, thanks for taking the time to reply to my post. The cautions you advise regarding listening to those who practice medicine for profit also applies to those who would criticize them as they too could have their own private agenda. This seems to be the case for the author of the quackwatch website: http://www.raysahelian.com/quackwatch.html Dr. Gonzalez was given a chance to do a preliminary study to demonstrate the effectiveness of his program on pancreatic cancer patients. He achieved the best results ever demonstrated in the history of medicine and was granted a chance to do the gold standard comparison of his program compared to the best allopathic cancer treatment for pancreatic cancer. His study was sabotaged by the scientists who were running the program who had a conflict of interest because their program was the one being compared with the Gonzalez program, but they were allowed to perform the study. After the study’s conclusion the biased scientists were charged, convicted and punished for their unscrupulous behavior. Read What Went Wrong by Nicholas Gonzalez for Dr. Gonzalez’s side of this story. Follow his references to verify what actually happened. You can also check out his One Man Alone which describes 50 patients treated by the Kelley program that all had clinically diagnosed cancers and all had reduction and disappearances of their tumors following the Kelley approach. On quackwatch it was stated that this manuscript was never published. It has been published. The quackwatch article is pretty old. The manuscript was not published initially because no one could believe that nutrition and diet had anything to do with cancer so no one dared to publish it. It took a couple of decades before the climate had changed to allow for it to be published. Persecution of new ideas that are perceived as threats to the established order, especially when that order is taking in millions of dollars with their expensive, often ineffective treatments has always been met with attempts to discredit and condemn them. Having looked at both sides my analysis says Gonzalez, Kelley, Gerson and others as far back as John Beard all have information and techniques that if objectively included in the current fraternity of cancer treatment approaches could bring a lot of relief and reduction of suffering to a population suffering from this cancer epidemic…Hi Humzee, Very interesting read :) Thanks for sharing! I agree with you, we probably all have our own reasons for believing what we do…speaking of which, have you seen my very favorite Dr. Greger video? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/ Be well, my friend :))Hi Jen, I have ordered 17 DVD’s so I will get a full dose of Dr. Greger’s knowledge soon! I haven’t watched the one you gave the link to. I have a satellite internet system and am limited as to how much I can download. Alas I am almost out of downloading allotment until Oct 8 so I will have to wait to watch it. I did preview the first minute or so and I can tell you that I like Dr. Esselstyn’s approach but have some reservations about its need to be so draconian – again I think his approach could be refined with some individual adjustments and he really doesn’t go far enough to discourage usage of all refined carbohydrates nor does he take into account the best ways to prepare grains to limit phytates, etc. as we see in traditional ways of preparing these complex carb sources. One of the reasons I’m low on download allotment for this month is that I did watch a lot of Dr. Greger videos and like his manner of presentation although I keep trying to read the actual research papers often shown in the background when he makes some nutritional point… frustrating as it never shows the whole paper..Gotta go to bed.. get my fix of natural melatonin…Humzee, Wow, you will be the expert! :) You are in for a treat! :) Can’t wait to hear what you think about them. Enjoy your DVDs! CheersI just started reading Dr. Barnard’s Power Foods for the Brain in which he recommends to limit Tea consumption because of its absorption of aluminum into the leaves. And yet Dr Greger has discussed its health benefits at great lengths as well (especially green tea and hibiscus). Is there an optimal range of consumption then? How much it too much? ThanksQuart or liter of tea per day is the Greger-approved level as I recall it.I appreciate learning about cheesy aluminum and urge my clients to remove such things. Shell of the book,”Recovering Autism, ADHD, & Special Needs.”I really like this site and the research that is delved into. However, the vegan bias is painfully evident. There are organic, less processed cheeses available that do not contribute aluminum to the diet. There are also vegan soy protein isolate products (not even mentioned) that contribute aluminum to the diet. Instead of painting a picture that demonizes all cheese, I feel a more responsible approach would be to offer straightforward advice to those who wish to continue eating animal products. A diet is a personal choice. While I do not agree with factory farms, I have many malabsorption issues which make a vegan diet an unhealthy choice for me (as I do not absorb many of the nutrients in these foods). Animal products are not synonymous with American Cheese and Egg McMuffins any more than miso and soy protein isolate fall into the same category on a health scale.Dr. Greger You are blaming (processed) cheese for Aluminum intake, but what about cacao you recommend for HD prevention? EU Foodauthorities registered hi Aluminum contents in various cacao samples. Is there any risk to get Aluminum related diseases?Antacids are commonly taken daily by a great many people including myself. Antacid contains Aluminum Hydroxide. Is this a problemThis very interesting video leads me to think about an issue I haven’t seen discussed on this site; namely, what types of cookware are safest. I have heard that some health professionals argue that aluminum cookware isn’t safe because harmful metals leech into the food — I’ve also heard similar things about cast iron. I’d be interested in hearing Dr. Greger’s opinion of, say, cast iron versus ceramic cookware — what’s the safest? Thanks!Dr. Christopher Shaw is a neuroscientist at the University of British Columbia and has been focusing his research on neurotoxicity of aluminum. Here he touches on the the difference between “injecting vs ingesting” this heavy metal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfTo35UrFPAJust watched this, 5 yrs later… I think is important to clarify, that study was about not only processed cheese, but pasteurized processed cheese. I wonder if aluminum is used in RAW cheeses? In goat or sheep cheeses? Guess will have to contact the company itself. RE: injected AL vs. ingested AL, even tho the quantities were estimated in regards of mutual bioavailability, the scenarios are very different. Injected aluminum is combined with a number of other agents, which are intentionally designed to create an inflammatory response; therefore the injected AL is likely to incur more cellular reactivity and/or damage.","['aluminum', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'antiperspirant', 'brain disease', 'brain health', 'Brussels sprouts', 'cheese', 'chicken', 'children', 'cooking methods', 'dementia', 'eggs', 'fish', 'food additives', 'sandwiches', 'seafood', 'tobacco', 'tomatoes', 'vaccines']",What is the number one source of aluminum in the diet?,"For more videos on the health risks associated with toxic metals, you can look at: Cadmium and Cancer: Plant vs. Animal Foods Get the Lead Out Amla and Triphala Tested for Metals Some Ayurvedic Medicine Worse Than Lead Paint ExposurePlease feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and I’d be happy to try to answer them.

And check out the other “HHH” videos (Harmful, Harmless, or Helpful?). Also, there are over a thousand subjects covered in the rest of my videos–please feel free to explore them as well!As far as weight loss goes, L-arginine and white bean extract were mentioned on the Dr. Oz show recently and I’m wondering what your opinion is on these supplements? As a dietitian, I’m hesitant to recommend any type of supplement because we are always taught “food first” but if something is safe and effective in blocking the absorption of (some) carbs or increasing metabolism, it could potentially be another tool in our arsenal to help people who are trying to lose weight. It would take some significant data to convince me to actually recommend supplements for weight loss, but just curious what your opinion is. Thanks!I share your concern about recommending supplements especially as it relates to weight loss. I recommend the only diet shown to work over time… the “ad libitum” low fat plant based diet with B12 supplementation. I particularly like and often cite the study, Shintani et al., The Hawaii Diet: Ad Libitum High Carbohydrate, Low Fat Diet for reduction of Chronic Disease Risk Factors: Obesity, Hypertension, Hypercholesterolemia, and Hyperglycemia, Hawaii Med J 60: 69-73; Mar 2001. I think the key concept for patients to understand is “calorie density” and not “calories”. I recommend and keep loaner copies on hand of Jeff Novick’s DVD, “Calorie Density: How to Eat More, Weigh Less and Live Longer”. He discusses the important concepts of satiety and calorie density and ties the latter to the amount of exercise a patient does. He shows how folks can lose “weight” without exercising. I also recommend John McDougall’s newsletter article (12/08), The Fat Vegan, so folks who adopt a plant based diet can avoid some of the behaviors that will thwart their efforts. Neal Barnard’s “Breaking the Food Seduction” is also helpful for many of my patients to help understand that the issue is “addiction” not weak will… it is available as a book or DVD. Resources beyond that depend on the patients individual circumstances. I’ve been practicing primary care medicine for over 30 years and the science is clear on the best approach. I’ve seen many diets come and go and many “supplement” recommendations come and go. I don’t recommend any of them. Calorie restricted diets don’t work in the long run except for a very small % of patients. Diets like the Atkins Diet have been shown not to be healthy. We can avoid chemicals see http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/obesity-causing-pollutants-in-food/ and start adopting the best overall diet see.. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/thousands-of-vegans-studied/. I am a fan of understanding the science and the complexity to help us understand what works for patients see… http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/how-to-upregulate-metabolism/ but we have to be able to give our patients straight forward practical information and avoid jumping on the latest bandwagon whether that is a supplement or the newest fad diet. For example I believe the best practical starter handout is PCRM’s Vegetarian Starter Kit available as free download on their website. Keep tuned to NutritionFacts.org as the science keeps changing..Where can I find a PCP like you? Out of curiosity, do you have any “primal” or “Paleo” folks coming to your practice these days?  It seems like this another diet trend/fad that is taking hold of the public and medical profession as well (our local news show even -uncritically- featured this type of diet for a week in its medical/health segment). Dr. Greger, I’ve got 3 questions on vitamin supplements that I couldn’t find answers (or should I say, reliable answers) on the internet. 1.       Many supplements contain magnesium stearate, which acts as a lubricant to prevent tablet and capsule contents from sticking to the machinery during production. Some say it is harmless, some say harmful. What’s your take on this issue? 2.       Are “whole food vitamins” really better than “synthetic vitamins”? They do sound better, but if you consider how the manufactures would have to do to extract those nutrients from food… No one has looked into how those are extracted or made, which might add potential contaminations. Am I thinking too much? 3.       What does “organic vitamin” really mean? If it is synthetic (looks so to me from reading their labels, if whole food is used, they sure would mention it), how can it be “organic? Thank you!At a minimum, isn’t taking an all natural vegetarian supplement a good way to get some of the trace micro-nutrients into our bodies? I see many ingredients on the label that I would not get otherwise. I take Solgar Earth Source Multi-Nutrient Tablets ($45 for 180 tablets…so, it’s like $90/year (one a day) and it is full of things that you recommend. Granted it is all mixed together.Eating whole unrefined plant foods will not result in vitamin deficiencies other then b12. What vitamins do you think you are missing? Also, you can put in your food for the day and see how much of each nutrient you are getting. I typically surpass recommendations eating only whole plant foods. Use this website run by the USDa for that purpose. http://cronometer.com/It would have been interesting to tease out those people who had the lowest intake of animal products from those with the highest. An argument could be made that vegans, who tend to be low or deficient in B12, protein, and iron, may have benefitted from multivitamins. In the absence of evidence, its hard to argue with your points, but I’d say the jury is still out on this question.Vegans are actually not low in protein, this would entail caloric deficiency http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vegetarians-get-enough-protein/In addition, appropriate iron status is not difficult for most people as long as they consume a diet based on whole ,unrefined plant foods. Please see here for details on enhancing absorption other then vitamin c. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-mineral-absorption-enhancers-found/The study you provided suggests that 3% of people actually are protein deficient, so clearly it can be a problem, as it was for me. I was at 25 grams a day protein because I had dropped most grains as a result of becoming pre-diabetic on an Ornish-style diet for 30 years (despite being slender/fit). Dropping grains brought my glucose down to normal levels, thankfully, and I’ve since learned to add back large quantities of daily tofu and some seitan so I’m finally stable re protein.However, it is a very difficult challenge to maintain sufficient B12 or iron on a plant-based diet, so I’ve had to add in a multi-vitamin for those. Please see this meta-study on B12 deficiency. It outlines how serious the B12 problem may be:http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v68/n5/full/ejcn201446a.htmlWould if you fast or are deficient in nutrients?

The food industry puts all it’s energy into figuring out how to make us eat more of their products. The advertising gets us to try it, and the carefully choreographed textures, flavors, saltiness, sweetness keep us coming back for more. The goal is to create a “food” that almost, but doesn’t quite satisfy us.A market economy provides what people demand, not what makes them healthy – unless that also happens to be what they demand. If vegetables and fruit could be cheaply packaged, stored, and commoditized like potato chips and Fruit Loops, we would see commercials every day touting the health benefits of vegetables and fruits. Instead, we’re sold potato chips “made with whole grains” and Fruit Loops fortified with “essential vitamins”.Government is the natural fallback in this situation and it could do a lot to resolve our confusion, but unfortunately these days rather than responding to the actual needs of its citizens it responds to the multitude of special interest groups with their own causes to defend and dollars to donate. That means corporations and the organizations they fund acting to defend and increase their interests, which ultimately means corporate profits. Unfortunately it does not mean the average citizen who is going about the business of living their lives who wouldn’t know the first thing about collective action or organizing a political advocacy group in defense of their interests…let alone healthy eating. The average person doesn’t even know what his or her interests are.No, the public doesn’t stand a chance in this day and political environment…but for nutrition information and education sites like this one…assuming someone is lucky enough to stumble upon it and decide that it, rather than any of the myriad websites promoting one fad diet over another, contains information that will help them improve their health through healthy eating.I do a lot of exercise, walk easily about 15,000 steps a day and do biking 3-4 times a week….BUT I still eat a fair amount of crappy processed junk so I know where the problem is.We’ve all heard this before and it’s true; YOU CAN’T OUT EXERCISE A BAD DIET.I have found this idea to be absolutely on the money. I’ve been eating your way for several years now, but found myself gaining weight over the last year. Highly perplexed, I sort of reverted back to my salad only days. Although I couldn’t sustain this for more than a couple weeks, a few pounds slipped off. But I was hungry…so I decided to listen to you, stop snacking, move more, and eat at regular times. Now I’m like I was in the beginning of my plant journey. I eat more whole grains, seeds, and beans with fruit, salads, and veggie sides. I walk instead of ride whenever possible. Stand instead of sit. Do exercises that are interesting and encouraging. The pounds are slowly coming off. I am satiated. I don’t constantly think about food anymore.Watching your videos encourages me to stay on track without obsessing about the whole thing. Thank you so much for this beautiful gift.Focusing on diet and exercise as culprits of the obesity epidemic, while true, is myopic since it does not identify the ultimate cause: the steadily declining American quality of life. Right now the domestic work week is approaching 50 hours while for the French, Germans and Austrians, it is 35 hours per week. The average American has 6 hours per week free time after getting the basics done. Americans don’t know how to cook anymore and don’t have the time for it anyway. Obviously, they don’t have time for exercise either. The effective enslavement of the masses to the military industrial complex that former President Eisenhower warned us about has come true.A terrific book that documents this is “The Overworked American”:http://www.amazon.com/Overworked-American-Unexpected-Decline-Leisure/dp/046505434X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427213895&sr=1-1&keywords=overworked+americanI trace this trend to the WWII Roosevelt Administration mobilization campaign to get women into the workforce typified by “Rosy the Riveter” propaganda:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie_the_RiveterSubsequent campaigns to convince women they are not “fulfilled” unless they burn their bras and enter the workforce have done the rest. The obvious is ignored: If “Rosy” is going to rivet, then hubby must homemake or the quality of life declines for both.No solution to the health and obesity epidemic is possible until the quality of American life is improved to allow for it.I guess it depends on how you define free time. The average American watches 4-6 hours of TV per day according to AC Nielsen. If that doesn’t count towards their free time, and is just considered ‘the basics’, then, yeah, we’re kinda low on time.I’m a lazy salary man myself, but my wife works a lot of overtime. Even with the 50 hour work week, volunteering at church on Wednesdays, a bible study group on Mondays, church on Sunday, going to our son’s sporting events, shopping (because shopping is, apparently, essential) and a daily workout, she still has hours to waste on Pintrest every day.You are right that our busy lifestyle is part of the reason why we’re obese (we don’t take the time to make food and just grab whatever is ready), but it isn’t “The Man” who is making us busy.I’m on board. I think it stinks too that so many women who have children, the future of this country, are forced out into the work place to support them, and have to hire a someone to do the job they wanted of raising their own child at home! Other countries have found better ways, why can’t we? My son passed away and I “see” my remote grandchildren trying to cope with this situation, and it is heartbreaking when there isn’t much I can do so far away! Then they have to be latchkey kids sometimes, bigger kids watching little kids, eating and drinking whatever…it’s nobody’s fault per se, but it is NOT healthy in any respect, and very stressful for everyone!I’m going to have to disagree. I think Americans have the time, they just don’t prioritize for it. We all have the same 24 hours in a day. How is it that a single parent working 2 jobs still manages to find the time to cook and eat healthy AND workout 30 minutes a day? The answer is because that is where their priority lies. Excuse will do wonders for a lazy person. Stop the excuses and find results.As we know, the message to the public can’t just be based on cutting calories. There has to be some part of the message that focuses on whole food sources vs processed foods.Why don’t you talk about the toxicity and addictive additives in foods instead of exercise. Everybody knows we are being fed anything but real food.Hi Beverly. Good question. I searched our website and we have lots of information on addictive foods. There is also research on cow’s milk casomorphin and autism and crib death.and perhaps people don’t know what to replace the unhealthy diet with? Once on a plant based whole food diet it’s quite important to learn a new range of cooking skills in order to stick with it, or you’ll give up and go back to processed food. Maybe education needs to be part of the equation as well.Totally agree, not just about the cooking, but all the new food choices and eliminating the old ones…and just all the change! Anyone who expressed interest in a plant based diet quickly felt overwhelmed by the dramatic changes that felt so unfamiliar, no matter how simple they seemed…I always try to give tips and links to basic, simple recipes, and step by step approaches like the 21 day challenge or the like, where they walk you through it one day at a time! Crazy but true. I think we are truly creatures of habit and that is why so many of us get stuck in our bad, but familiar ruts…and don’t really want to change! LOL! I know that was true for me for all but the last 5 years!yes if it feels like you’re depriving yourself people won’t be able to stick with it. I needed to workout the balance of each meal ie how to incorporate a plant based protein (and how to make it appetizing) No one is going to last if it tastes like cardboard. I also had to get used to the bulk of vegetables we needed to purchase. I liked the Engine 2 diet book while trying to figure out the new way of planning groceries and putting together meals in the beginning. Then you develop your own meals gradually. but you know you’ve made progress when you feel ill watching a cooking program using dairy/animal protein/ mountains of sugar and you have to switch the channel ! Or trying a biscuit after several months and not enjoying the taste anymore, and realizing that you really prefer the taste of fruit /nuts/dried fruit now. My sense of smell and taste buds changed as well. I also did not feel hungry as often as I used to , and it leveled out. I agree that you have to tackle it one day at a time , it became natural for the whole family after about 5- 6 months.Good for you getting the whole family on board! It was just me and my husband, who lost his leg to diabetes and poor self care. Not wanting the same fate, I got on board with the WFPB diet, reversed many illnesses and my own life-long struggle with obesity. I am a total convert, I wish I could say the same for him. His habits rule him and I have to realize you can lead a horse to water…but…you know.It’s great to have the extra energy isn’t it? It is amazing you were able to free yourself from the life-long struggle with obesity. Eating habit is the hardest thing to change because unlike drugs/toxins etc we actually need food. I think I am almost there with reversing my blood glucose problems but I am still needing to tweak things. Habits are really hard to break so I can see why it’s hard for your husband, I still crave for certain things too, but of course we do wish our partners and ageing relatives will make the switch so they can avoid future illnesses. Sometimes children are better at adapting so they kind of lead us too in a way.The diet mentality I had always been taught…caloric restriction and portion control, are doomed to fail by their very nature. Feeling sated is a biological drive that asserts itself and defeats the best of intentions, causing enormous self hatred at one’s perceived “failure” and weakness, time and time again. I “dieted” my way to over 300 lbs, ate so little, and still could not lose weight, even with exercise. Everyone else assumes you just pig out all day and lay around, that just adds to the self esteem issues. I wish I had learned about the WFPB lifestyle so much earlier in life, because that was the key to all my problems, (as I’m sure it would be for most anyone) but better late than never!In fact exercise actually makes you fat. Russell Eaton, author, “Why You Should Avoid Exercise”…and to lose weight you should eat Cheetos and drink beer, because in fact, eating more actually makes you thin.Its pretty obvious that its not physical activity but poor diet. Kitchen workers are active most of their days yet many are obese.I work in a kitchen. I was obese for many years. Just standing up all day did not help me lose weight. I finally got a grip on my weight when I started bicycling to work everyday. I lost 95 pounds that way. Just standing up all day does not raise one’s heart rate. Raising one heart rate during exercise is what can really help with weight control. Riding up hills on a bike raises one’s heart rate I couldn’t eat ALL that I wanted and still lose weight by exercise, but my diet didn’t have to be nearly as draconian as it would have been had I not exercised everyday. Anyway, I haven’t gained back even one pound in 5 years and I have actually lost 10 more. Even after the 95 pound weight loss, I was already in the normal weight range. I have continued to exercise everyday and have steadily improved my diet. I don’t eat meat at all and eat far fewer sweets than I used to. Now, I might be getting too thin. So, exercise DOES help with weight control at the right amount and with SOME control of diet- it does lessen the severity of the control needed. It also helps a lot to eat plants, because the fiber contained in it is very conducive to weight control as well. Eating only whole foods and not processed foods also helps a lot as well. To me, it is not either/or but both/and. It also isn’t a matter of going to the gym, but incorporating activity into one’s daily living, such as by bicycling to work. Also fixing one’s own meals is very helpful. I only go out to eat once every two weeks.I am beginning my dissertation for my PhD program about August and am doing the dissertation on obesity and cognition. I would love to discover some of the study resources you cite to add to my lit review. Thank you.Hi Marjorie. Good luck on your project! All citations are listed within each hyperlink on this blog post. Let me know if any of them do not work. Also, you’ll find the “sources cited” button under each video title helpful for Dr. Greger’s references. Lastly, you may find some great citations from our obesity page. Or even more when searching for cognition. You may be preoccupied for a few days :) Best of luck let us know how we can help!Sincerely, JosephThank you for your kind response. I have indeed been preoccupied in my readings, but I am enjoying the data.The US food supply statistics may throw some light on the background to obesity. For example in 1909 when figures began, the food supply equated to about 3,400 kcalories per person per day. In 2010, the last year for I’ve seen figures, it was 4,000 kcalories per person per day. Saturated fat was 50 (grams I think) per person per day in 1909 and 59 in in 2010. It reached a high of 64 in 2002 and 2003. Carbohydrate fell from 499 in 1909 to 474 in 2010 and fibre from 29 to 25 while cholesterol rose from 440 to 460.http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/USFoodSupply-1909-2010This news was disturbing and you’ll be glad you gave up seafood. “Slave-caught seafood winds up in US” http://rt.com/usa/243841-slave-caught-seafood-us/The Pleasure Trap by Doug Lisle explains a lot for me. It’s similar to alcoholism or drug addiction. Today’s food evidently simply provides too much of a pleasure shot, it’s so hard to say no to more. So, get it out of the house and don’t go to restos or places where that’s all they serve. We can relearn how to eat.Cell’s ability to store fat is an evolutionary survival adaptation. Researchers need to focus on the genes that allow cells to store fat so that we can escape the flood of phony miracle diets and miracle lifestyle and nutritional cures that are endlessly being peddled to a frustrated ad gullible Public..I recently heard a talk about the effect of glyphosate (Monsanto’s roundup) in the food supply causing a hormone disruption. In as small as parts per trillion!!!These pollutants cause obesity. In higher concentrations they cause cancer, infertility, etc… Check out Stephanie Seneff MIT professor and her talks about this chemical…. Avoid Glyphosate, eat non-GMO and organic.Americans and people of most nations are systematically socialized to eat unhealthy, and are systematically hindered from getting knowledge about what is healthy. Even the pediatricians that children go to, which usually are grossly overweight themselves, and hence very bad role models, participate in this bad socialization program.

Actually as you know revivogen a natural DHT inhabitor product which has omega3( i believe its derived from either flax seeds, olive oil or fish) plus it has alcohol which I think make it quite active along with zinc. revivogen is quite thin actually. it really works , I’ve found it incredible product but its costlier to me that is why I also bought hairmax comb also which is a one time investment but I believe I still miss revivogen. I want something topical, so I was searching what aleternative can be of revivogen, last week I used extra virgin olive in my hair at bedtime , trust me any kind of itching/ tigling which specially occurs after hairmax went away, i washed hair in the morning they were shiny like they had a life, though revivogen also does same work. I am just wondering can it really helpful using olive oil into scalp to stop DHT ?check out amla in smoothies or on scalp. Good luck.to help stop DHT use saw palmetto herb good for both your hair and prostate, and fo-ti herb also good for hair and keeps it from graying.Are there any studies you know of that show correlation between diet and alopecia?

People on a good veg diet normally take in lots of the stuff, but I was wondering if you can have too much of a good thing, with possible negative impacts on the effectiveness of your digestion and nutrient assimilation?Got one of your DVD’s recently and have watched and enjoyed it numerous times. Please keep up your extremely important work.I do have a few videos on fiber, but given its importance I should do more. Thanks for your suggestion–keep an eye on the site and I’ll post some fiber videos soon.Thank you!Love your last name :)Thanks. I had my name for breakfast this morning, along with blueberries, almonds, and unsweetened organic soy milk (lol).Wow–power breakfast! Sounds delish.Michael, Have you heard of “The Indian Slow Cooker” book by Anupy Singla?? It is NEARLY vegan and You don’t need oil. She uses dried beans in the recipes and all the super, healing spices. The recipes are SIMPLE and tasty and cheap. I have blogged through many of them. I actually had kind of given up cooking, leaning more toward raw foods, until her book came out and then I cooked slow cooker food everyday. But it is like a miracle book for people who don’t want to spend a lot, as you can buy organic dried beans, and the veggies for next to nothing. PLUS she is coming out with an ALL vegan book next year, as she eats mostly vegan anyway. But her current book is so perfect for busy people who say they have no time to eat anything healthy and who have no money. And she is getting into health, as many peeps she knows do have troubles from the dairy laden Indian food.Sounds delicious–thanks so much for the tip! Anyone else have any favorite cookbooks they want to share?Oh my…back when I was eating SAD, I poo-poo’d spices!To help me prepare food that is as fresh/full of nutrients as possible, I reference Dr. Gabriel Cousens’ recipes in his book: Rainbow Green, Live-Food Cuisine♥Not familiar with that one, but I added a library link to it. Indeed, in some ways the more colorful and flavorful one’s diet is the healthier it may be!Cookbooks! Started out with the recipes in Esselstyn‘s Prevent or Reverse Heart Disease, then added The New McDougall Cookbook. These were wonderful teachers for a beginner. More recently I am really enjoying Veganomicon by Moskowitz & Romero, 2 vegan chefs — Appetite for Reduction, also by Isa Chandra Moskowitz — and Color Me Vegan by Colleen Patrick-Goudreau . These latter 3 do have some fats for sauteeing and some salt, but it’s easy to adjust for it.Can’t wait to hit the library–thanks!★ As a big fan, I just learned that there is no concrete scientific evidence that antioxidants positively effect human health.

Am I doing something wrong?Scott–thank you so much for finding that! The link was wrong but has now been corrected.Dr. Greger,I was interested in your take on what the abstract of this cited paper says with respect to antioxidant levels of the vegetables tested and the anticancer affects they have. I’m actually very surprised!! The abstract says:“The antiproliferative effect of vegetables was specific to cells of cancerous origin and was found to be **largely independent** of their antioxidant properties.” [my emphasis]So, what this seems to me to be saying is that we may not want to be focusing on the antioxidant levels of plant-based foods afterall (at least not for possible anti-cancer affects)…??Hello Maybush1,I believe the purpose of antioxidants is for protection of the cells key components, such as the DNA and mitochondria, ensuring long term health and stability while these specific foods that have anticancer enzymes are more for a short term approach directly stopping any cancer from growing, and of course, eating a lot of these foods everyday makes short term last for a lifetime! Check out these videos on antioxidants for further details. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/repairing-dna-damage/ http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/research-into-reversing-aging/ http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/Here’s the thing – there is no magic to vegetables. People who have cancer and remove refined sugars from their diet significantly decrease the #1 fuel source of virtually all cancers – and that is glucose.But to combat cancer even better, adopting a VLCKD is the best choice. This would entail removing virtually all carbohydrate from the diet.http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/33This deals with brain cancer but since virtually all cancers use glucose as their fuel source, a VLCKD should work in the same manner and other research papers have shown such.Other resources:http://www.carbohydratescankill.com/3010/there-role-for-carbohydrate-restriction-treatment-prevention-of-cancer-yes-of-courseThere is no magic to vegetables. There is just much harm in processed sugars and high blood glycemia.Frederick Its funny you keep talking about “fueling” the cancer with glucose when ALL our cells run on glucose. Again, eliminating carbohydrates does not make any sense. Your health outlook is severely skewed to viewing all carbohydrates as bad, which is plain wrong. It has been shown that cancer proliferation does in fact cease with certain vegetables. http://missclasses.com/mp3s/Prize%20CD%202010/Previous%20years/Antioxidants/Mindblower.pdfThat paper shows how certain plant components affect cancer in a lab, not in the human body.You said:“Its funny you keep talking about “fueling” the cancer with glucose when ALL our cells run on glucose.”No they don’t. They can, but not always. They can run just fine on fat and ketone bodies – better in fact. And glucose can and is made via gluconeogenesis. No need for carbs in the diet at all in order to obtain all the glucose you need. I’m amazed you don’t know that.And cancer cells DO feed on glucose. Have you not read the research? Allow me to start you on your journey:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394295/“Again, eliminating carbohydrates does not make any sense.”It makes perfect sense to keep blood glucose levels normal best done by limiting carbohydrate intake. And it sure matters a lot to the diabetic.“Your health outlook is severely skewed to viewing all carbohydrates as bad, which is plain wrong.”Strawman. I never said that. I’ve said many times that most vegetables and some seasonal fruits are quite good for you. It’s the grains that need to go.“It has been shown that cancer proliferation does in fact cease with certain vegetables.”Really? Show me the research that supports this.And again, the idea that vegetables are the reason for a slowing of cancer fail to take into account that when people have cancer and go vegan, they also remove all the junk food from their diets. THAT is what is most responsible for the slowing down of cancer not the vegetables themselves.I challenge you to put up your most recent blood panel. Here are my fasting numbers from 5/2011 (I’m 50 yrs. old):HDL: 83 HDL3: 61 LDL: 174 LDL Pattern: A (large buoyant) HbA1c: 5.6 Triglycerides direct: 57 CRP: 1.02 links Frederick, http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/ http://www.atkinsexposed.org/Regardless if it was in a lab, the fact that these vegetables affected the cancer cells themselves, to the extent of stopping the growth, sends a powerful message. Let’s see beef extracts do that in a lab.The paleo diet is not supported by any credible health foundation, for good reason. Ketosis is harmful in the long run, as explained thoroughly by Dr. Greger, i dont need to do any copy and pasting for that. From what i understand by your response, u view vegetables as vitamins and water. Antioxidants and phytonutrients in vegetables are what makes them so healthy and helps prevent cancer. Go look at the many studies Dr. Greger cites from this link http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/slowing-the-growth-of-cancer-3/ Showing the marked decrease in cancer risk with vegetables consumption and how meat significantly increases this risk. I am assuming since you think grains are so bad that the past rural Japanese populations, that had most of their diet comprised of rice, had short lifespans and poor health? No, they thrived. They were known to be typically centenarians. Same story for the Okinawan.P.S. I have never had a blood test taken (last time i remember I was 6 years old), I have not had any bodily issues.I read the study at Fredrick link and I could see no mention of any advantage of the “KD” diet – it grew the cancer as fast as the “SD”. “While CT-2A growth was rapid with the unrestricted feeding of either diet, a moderate 40% restriction of either diet significantly reduced growth.” Only calorie restriction slowed the growth of the cancer, on either the “SD” or the “KD”. Or did I miss something?Hi Michael or any volunteer, I want to know if it’s possible to have the complete article cited in this video. It will be useful for me. Anne-Marie RoyHere is the full pdf file, enjoy! http://missclasses.com/mp3s/Prize%20CD%202010/Previous%20years/Antioxidants/Mindblower.pdfDr. Gregor, first of all, thank you! Love the site!In this video you didn’t reveal the full lifting of the vegetables and their respective rankings in the charts relative to different cancers. Do you address that else where? Would love to see full charts with veggies listed. Thanks.The next video would show the charts. Here is the link! http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/1-anticancer-vegetable/Thank you, Dr. Gregor. Excellent information.Also be sure to check out my associated blog post Breast Cancer and Diet!Dr. Greger,I pulled the paper you cited. Figure 1 puzzles me. Yes, garlic kills all tumor cells. But I also see that orange bell peppers and radish make pancreatic carcinoma worse (even if you account for the error). The same goes for jalapeno and tomato in case of lung cancer. Does this mean we should stop eating these vegetables?Thanks.No, of course not! This is all in vitro which means outside of the body. These vegetables are good guidelines but they are not solid proof that cancer will completely stop in their presence in vivo until further studies are done. Keep eating your bell peppers and jalapenos with a peace of mind.Dr. Greger,My question is about the study(ies) relating to brain tumors and spinach and beet roots demonstrating anticancer effects. Did the study(ies) include oligodendrogliomas?Thank you for posting these videos–they are very informative!My son is 25 and sadly just diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He is having 5 weeks aggressive chemo and then Whipple surgery. I just started him on a whole foods plant based diet with two fresh green juices a day. A big raw salad and lightly steamed cruciferous veggies with fresh garlic or fresh garlic dressing. Is there anything else I should feed him? He has beans and hole grains and sweet potatoes too. I need to get as much tumor fighting food in his body to combat the cancer.This video is highly relevant. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/ Also, Amla may provide great benefit http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/ More information on cancer is here. http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/* whole* not holeAs much as I’m a fan, I don’t see the connection between the effect of these vegetables on cancer outside the human body. It’s quite a leap for me to accept that the outcome of these petri dish studies have anything to do with what goes on in our bodies. There may be an influence but then… how do we know that in a real bodily context the other veggies don’t have a powerful effect as well. I want to believe it and I’m excited to eat more of the powerful veggies, but I can’t help but doubt the validity of this science. (Again, you take a simple lab context and correlate this to an immensely more complicated human body context.) Please, I’d like to think otherwise.What does the study mean by “living human cancers”? Where these in living human bodies or outside them? The earlier studies required a leap of faith, why don’t these studies also require a leap of faith? Don’t get me wrong, I tend to want to believe it. But my mind requires me to question this…Author George Johnson has just published a book entitled The Cancer Chronicles: Unlocking Medicine’s Deepest Mystery in which he apparently (I haven’t read the book yet) claims that “large-scale studies have failed to show a strong relationship between consuming more fruits and vegetables and a lower incidence of cancer.” This quote is from a Mother Jones magazine article on the book, and it goes on to cite how “clinical trials using vitamin supplements have actually shown increased risk of cancer in certain populations, and have cast doubt on the significance of micronutrients in reducing your overall mortality.”Do you have any comments on this? I’d expect the book to have a more nuanced discussion; perhaps the Mother Jones article conflated consumption of vitamin supplements with consumption of whole vegetables containing those vitamins, which, from my understanding of your research reviews, are two very different modalities?Dr. Greger,Great video. Please tell me where is the vegetable breakdowns for specific cancers?

Also, there are over a thousand subjects covered in the rest of my videos–please feel free to explore them as well!I love the dry humor in this video!But, what about the consideration (even with moderate alcohol consumption) of its effect on liver health and brain cells? I would think that liver and brain cell death in healthy people would be a bad thing.I agree, that is why I dont drink alcohol at allThis is a very interesting topic as so many people believe that alcoholic beverages are heart-healthy, despite known cellular toxicity of alcohol. Do we even know for a fact (through randomized trials) if the pure alcohol itself is providing the health benefits or whether the benefits exist for some other reason such as because of the antioxidants present in the plant components of the alcoholic beverages. There is evidence that alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer contain appreciable quantities of antioxidants. Furthermore, it has been argued that antioxidants are beneficial to the heart (see for example “The power of NO”). Of potential relevance is the question of whether alcohol or associated processing techniques (i.e. fermentation) enhance the bio-availability of the antioxidants present in alcoholic beverages? In other words, maybe the grape components in wine have more nutritional value than the equivalent amount of grape before processing.One advantage of wine over grape juice is that it does not cause a sugar spike since fermentation removes most of the sugars. Of course, eating whole grapes would be better. However, the grapes used in wine are very different than those available in the grocery store. The wine grapes often have thick skins and, I believe, are not as enjoyable to eat. Further, the wine health benefit is better if it is organic and the natural pests force the vine to defend itself thereby producing some compounds in the grapes that provide health benefits.Please also check out my associated blog post, Breast Cancer Survival and Soy!Great. And it shows that if you are taking care of your nutrition aka consider yourself a health freak – it is a big step ahead – as long as you enjoy what you eat and drink! That is my opinion. I eat healthy most of the time, exercise every day and love my glass of wine with my dinner and a non-grata food item once in a while. Thank – great short piece of information.Of course, the unethical gotcha in this sneak of study is they’ve included a lot of unhealthy people in the health nut category….1 serve of veges? come on! The adverse effects of moderate alcohol intake will be masked by the group’s lower baseline health. If they chose real health nuts, with higher baseline health, then alcohol’s toxic effects would be more obvious.I didn’t know that I was health freak for most of my lifeOne of the problems I saw in an article (a long time ago) was that the non-alcohol intake group in studies included not just T-total people who never drank but T-totalers who drank an awful lot before practicing abstinence.When these two types of non-drinkers were separated the article suggested that those practicing abstinence were worse off health wise than those who drank very little and that those who didn’t drink but didn’t have a history of drinking were better off than moderate drinkers.It’s ashame I don’t have the article to hand, or know where to find it and I don’t think it effects your analysis (especially for the study on us “health freaks”) but interesting non the lessIn another video, he links low levels of pesticides to Alzheimer’s. Many, if not most wines likely contain low levels of pesticides. So… maybe not as healthy as he thinks, unless you choose a biodynamic or organic wine.I am looking for advice in the best diet for a recovering alcoholic. I have heard cravings for alchohol might be decreased by consuming less grains as they are metabolically the same as drinking most liquor and beer. Is this true?I have never even thought about diet for recovery! Perhaps focusing on diet is just one healthy behavior among many that can help. One study found just that. Alcohol craving in rehabilitation: assessment of nutrition therapy “Patients who received nutrition therapy reported significantly fewer hypoglycemic symptoms, lower sugar intake, less alcohol craving as well as significantly greater nutrient intakes; a greater number abstained from alcohol. These findings indicate that nutrition therapy can aid in the recovery from alcoholism.” I think mindfulness, which of course means something different to us all, plays a large role in recovery or change. Being mindful of our choices, our health, families, relationships, and physical activity. This video discusses research on trans fats and aggression. The results from this study show that the more hydrogenated fats consumed the greater the risk of aggression, perhaps something a recovering alcoholic may want to avoid? Lastly, diet has been found to improve mood.Although I am not sure the best diet, choosing more whole foods and more of a plant-based diet could help. Whole grains are just fine and are nothing near similar to the calories from alcohol.Thanks again for reposting this great question!

A single olive has nearly 40 mg of sodium so this can pile up quite quickly. Try to stay below the 1200 mg per day of sodium threshold and you will be fine.http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/7338/2I’m not sure how to apply some of the advise I’m learning from you to my athletic teens. Coconut water doesn’t have the fat so is that Ok? My children play rigorous sports practicing about 2 – 2.5 hours per day. In competition they may play 3 to 4 one hour games each day. The sport drink companies have made us believe that replenishing electrolytes is important. I guess they mean salts and minerals that are lost during activity. Do we need to replace “electrolytes”? Is coconut water a good healthy and natural source instead of a sports drink which is loaded with sugar? I’ve also heard chocolate milk is one of the best post game recovery drinks. I guess chocolate soy milk would be better than chocolate cow’s milk despite the added sugar. Is sugar bad if you are a young healthy, in-shape athlete? If you are playing multiple games in a day with little break time in between, many athletes need fuel and hydration but they can’t have anything heavy on their stomachs to prevent cramping. That’s why I believe chocolate milk has been recommended as satisfying that criteria.coconut water is amazing for you, coconut milk is NOT. They are 2 different substancesBetter yet, coconut water is no better for you than water…drink green tea instead.Hibiscus AND green tea. With dried Indian gooseberries. While snacking on dates. DAAAAAAAANG! Haha, love you.These are great questions, Lisa. I will try to address each one at a time. First, you are right about coconut water. This is the clear juice in the cavity of the coconut. This differs from coconut milk, which is made from pressed coconut meat. Coconut water contains almost none of the saturated fat found in coconut milk. Now, here’s the scoop on electrolytes. It is true that we lose these minerals when we exercise, but this is not a concern since they are easily replaced when we eat our next meal. However, in activities lasting ninety minutes or more, replacing both electrolytes and fluids is crucial. In fact, in sports lasting longer than three hours, replenishing electrolytes can prevent dangerous conditions such as hyponatremia. So, although they are loaded with sugar, sports drinks can be a smart option during intense athletic events (such as competitions) when glucose, electrolyte, and fluid replacement is essential. Still, sports drinks are loaded with empty calories that provide little nutritional value. There are healthier alternatives, as you mentioned. Coconut water and soy milk are both great options. Coconut milk is almost 95% water and is loaded with electrolytes such as potassium and sodium, and therefore is a good natural alternative to a sports drink. As for recovery, chocolate soy milk has virtually the same ratio of carbohydrates, fat, and protein (see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/milk-protein-vs-soy-protein/ as chocolate cow’s milk, but unlike dairy, it is naturally cholesterol- and lactose-free, and low in saturated fat. It is also a good source of calcium, vitamin A, D, and B12, and loaded with antioxidants (see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/, with none of the unhealthy hormones found in cow’s milk (http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dairy-acne-2/).You should update the info in this comment….nothing special about coconut water other than industry’s hype!Wow, what a bummer. And here I’ve been buying coconut milk, ice cream and creamer.Was the Nasi lemak used in the study with the coconut milk ONLY rice and coconut milk and no other fat added?Looking at coconut meat itself, a 2x2x1/2 inch square of coconut meat has a whopping 14 grams of saturated fat. This is already 75% of the daily value of saturated fat intake (which is too high as is). Coconut milk is made of the concentrated coconut meat, so pressing and processing a high fat food will still create a high fat product. A much better alternative would be almond milk or hemp milk. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/good-great-bad-killer-fats/In general nasi lemak seems to be served with eggs, meat, fish. I think more proof is needed to show that coconut milk is bad for us. But, I don’t see any reason for me to consume it in the mean time, better safe than sorry. There are so many wonderful plant-based foods that taste wonderful and are good for us.Hi Dr. Greger,I just bought a 200g bag of unsweetened shredded coconut (which I love), but upon looking at the nurition label I noticed that a 100g serving (which is a pretty hefty serving) contains a whopping 65g of fat, 57g of which is saturated. This took me aback somewhat, but I really enjoy flaked coconut with my nuts and seeds mixture. What are the main differences health-effects-wise between plant and animal sat fats? Or more to the point can you overdose on plant sat fats? Thanks.Saturated fat in plants and animals are all similar in that they have no “double” bonds but have different numbers of carbons ranging from 4 to 18. For all practical purposes you should avoid them as much as possible especially animal sources and processed plant oils like coconut and palm kernel oil. All oils have some saturated fat… yes even olive oil. Consuming whole plant sources as coconut flakes in the study mentioned in this video seems to be okay. The whole plant food comes with fiber, water(except for dried products, antioxidants among other substances. However the studies keep rolling in so keep tuned.What is the effect of the use of virgin coconut oil/milk on a wholefoods vegan diet? Granted all extracted oil is nutritionally inferior or even detrimental(heat/chemically extracted oils or those high in omega 6) to its intact plant form – making the notion that one should consume such foods in hopes of improving their health somewhat nonsensical- nonetheless the question remains if the mild use of virgin coconut milk/oil in a wholefoods vegan diet renders the ill effects of coconut’s saturated fat innocuous? In an Indian or Thai vegetable curry would the nutritionally loaded vegetables counteract the effects of coconut oil/milk, producing results akin to the whole coconut flake? Could this be the link in the often discrepant studies done on indigenous cultures using coconut; i.e. can those with diets primarily based on typical whole foods vegan fare withstand the use of coconut whereas those whose diets include a greater percentage of animal products cannot? Comments appreciated :)Coconut oil is essentially liquid fat, that being 91% saturated fat. Whole foods vegan diet means no processed foods, INCLUDING oil. If one includes oil in their diet they are no longer heart attack proof. Coconut milk is also another high fat food, and the same applies. It is best to avoid these foods. We should all try to keep our saturated fat intake to around 5 grams or less, and this fat would be coming from whole plant foods such as nuts and oats. In reference to the different fats in oils“All 3 fats were associated with a significant increase in new atherosclerosis lesions. Most importantly, the growth of these lesions did not stop when polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats were substituted for saturated fats. Only by decreasing all fat intake including the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats did the lesions stop growing.”http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/263/12/1646.abstract?sid=47d1d016-3c15-43f4-a013-0d10144ef8e3Check out Dr. Greger’s link on the “fats” in details. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/good-great-bad-killer-fats/No one has cleared up for me why my breast milk is so high in saturated fat, yet saturated fat is apparently bad for humans.Is it good for babies and young children up to a certain age? If so, what age?This is merely an assumption, but perhaps since babies are born with 0 fat on their body, the saturated fat is a good tool to bulk up the fat reserves of the baby for insulation. This is why babies appear so chubby. This is of course just my guess.Babies are born with 0 fat on their body? You sure that statement sounds correct? I’m all for a plant-based diet, but it makes no logical sense that saturated fat is bad for us, yet the perfect food to raise a human on is loaded with saturated fat. Does that make sense to you? It doesn’t to me. I suspect that Dr. Greger (bless him for the work he has done) is mislead on this one issue because, in general, people who eat lots of saturated fat probably don’t eat lots of vegetables since they’re too busy wolfing down steaks, for example. But what about vegetarians like me who consume lots and lots of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and saturated fats from coconuts and cheese? With all due respect to Dr. Greger and team (whom I respect), he does not have the data from a large group of people eating a healthy diet with plenty of saturated fats. He has access to the SAD diet who has plenty of the latter, but not of the former.Let me rephrase my 2 year old statement. Babies are generally born with little fat on their body. I would not expect a human adult to consume human milk for sustenance. Babies are a different story and have different needs. Yes I agree it is interesting that milk contains saturated fat, I don’t think that is an excuse for us as adults to think saturated fat is healthy because of this.It has been well established that a diet high in saturated fat raises serum cholesterol.“The saturated fatty acids, in contrast to cis mono or polyunsaturated fatty acids, have a unique property in that they suppress the expression of LDL receptors (Spady et al., 1993). Through this action, dietary saturated fatty acids raise serum LDL cholesterol concentrations (Mustad et al., 1997).”http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10490&page=432 I’m not aware of any studies on how long to breast feed infants. It seems reasonable to transition to a whole plant based diet and introduce new foods as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatricians… of course their recommendations to add dairy, meat and eggs should be ignored. A good guide, Nutrition in Kids, is available for free download on the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine’s (PCRM) website. I wouldn’t be concerned about the saturated fat in human milk as it is the best available product. Of course nursing mothers need to be careful of their diet so as to minimize chemicals in their breast milk… see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-pollutants-in-vegans/.I heard that because mothers breast milk is not usually exposed to oxygen, the cholesterol is not harmful. It’s when it’s exposed to elements that it become oxidized and harmful. I think that info came from Dr. Fuhrman. sorry, don’t know the source for sure.Not exposed to oxygen? Oxygen is everywhere though. Even if the baby did it’s best to “chew” the milk with no oxygen in it’s mouth, there is oxygen in it’s stomach that would be “oxidating” the milk/cholesterol/saturated fat. That doesn’t seem like a plausible explanation to me. I’ve heard of oxidized cholesterol (if one were to scramble egg yolks, for example), but that requires cooking the cholesterol, not exposing it to oxygen. Likewise, you would not want to pasteurize your own milk – you’d want it raw. I don’t think exposing it to a relatively small amount of oxygen would do anything.Your site is GREAT. Bruce Fife, C.N., N.D.in “The coconut oil miracle”, Johny Bowen, Ph.D. in “The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth” and Dr Oz (uses coconut oil as his bread spread) all believe that coconut oil is extremely healthy. You believe coconut oil is bad because of its affect on cholesterol. Would you comment on this.Don’t buy into the marketing BS of coconut oil. It is 91% saturated fat (butter is 68% saturated fat). The companies will then brag that their saturated fat is made up of mostly the least damaging kind. Indeed this is true, but 28% of the total saturated fat content in the coconut oil is the worst kind, so they give a half truth. Our body has no dietary need for saturated fat and an abundance of evidence supports the theory that saturated fat causes endothelium impairment leading to heart disease.This 2 year study looked at coronary artery lesions of the heart after consuming different types of fat. Polyunsaturated fat (omega 3 type of fat) Monounsaturated fat (75% of which makes up olive oil) and Saturated fat (the kind found in mostly animal products and coconut oil). They looked at angiograms a year apart after intervening with increasing one type of fat in each group. All 3 fats were associated with a significant increase in new atherosclerosis lesions. Most importantly, the growth of these lesions did not stop when polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats were substituted for saturated fats. Only by decreasing all fat intake including the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats did the lesions stop growing. http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/263/12/1646.abstract?sid=47d1d016-3c15-43f4-a013-0d10144ef8e3The burden of proof is upon the companies to provide scientific evidence that coconut oil is healthful.Thanks for the reply. I have to admit I am still on the fence on coconut oil. Bruce Fife, cn., n.d. makes a good argument for it being a very healthy food. Also the Pacific Islanders who ate more coconut based food than anyone, had almost no heart disease.Present some studies to prove its benefits. Doctors, like Atkins, can talk about certain food to make it sound great for you when its indeed quite harmful.No offense but your information is highly wrong (my opinion) because back then during patheolic era humans lived off meats and animals and even hunted and killed many back then and they continued to live longer then we live now because of all this government bullshit about wheat, grains, and legumes etc..did the cave man ever have bread NOOO they didn’t they had unprossed food INCLUDING COCONUTS that they would just eat raw so tell me if the cavemen lived longer and healthier over the years and not have any chemicals or disease including cancer which humans today somehow created..plus humans were meant to live off fat not carbohydrates.Ohhh my laken, you are so misinformed! You need to read some books and studies by Drs Esselstyn, Ornish, Furhman and others starting in the early 1940s. But I think maybe the best place for you to start would be either the Blue Zones or the Okinawan Diet…Our body has no dietary need for saturated fat? Then why is mother’s milk loaded with it? With all due respect to Greger and yourself, whom I agree with on most things, this issue does not make sense to me if nature specifically created the food we were meant to be raised on packed with the fatty acid that you claim the body does not need.Please see here for saturated fats physiological roles, and take note that our body has no dietary need for saturated fat. http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10490&page=422Yay! I’m glad fresh coconut meat is harmless :^)  I enjoy the water and the whole-food meat of coconuts. Be weary Strix, it is extremely high in saturated fat. A 2″ x 2″ X 1/2″ thick piece of coconut meat has 16 grams of saturated fat and we should strive to keep saturated fat intake as low as possible. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/Doesnt the body produce less saturated fat when it is ingested? So that if you are just eating coconuts every now and then, its irrelevant?Eating coconuts every now and then is perfectly fine. Once every few weeks I am sure would not hurt as it is indeed a whole plant food. I cannot say the same for coconut oil. In regards to saturated fat though, any intake above 0 can increase our risk for heart disease so we should stay as close to 0 as possible. Although nuts and coconuts do have more significant quantities of saturated fat, these foods should not be the bulk of the diet, and if your saturated fat intake is 5% or less of your total caloric intake there is no need for concern. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/I was curious about something new I’ve seen called coconut butter.  It seems to be a whole food contain proteins, carbs, and fats…I didn’t check the fiber.  Also is coconut oil okay if you have low cholesterol?Coconut oil is quite harmful http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-coconut-oil-good-for-you/Refined or unrefined?I’ve been eating a raw vegan desert that has coconut cream in it. I asked the owner what coconut cream was and his reply “Coconut Cream is the meat from the Organic Mature Coconuts..we scoop the meat out and juice it..so its creamy…and its naturally rich. Coconut Oil is made from Coconut Cream!” What do you think Doc?Coconuts are one of the highest saturated plant foods. A 2″x2″x1/2″ square of coconut meat contains about 13 grams of saturated fat. This is 67% of the already very generous Daily Value of saturated fat set by the USDA. We should strive to keep saturated fat as low as possible. Consuming this desert perhaps once a week or less will probably do no harm, but eating this type of food too often could indeed pose some potential health risks.http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3106/2 http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/we use coconut in all our daily meals…coconut milk in our curries…do U think i should not add coconut milk in my food i have high cholestrerol. thank U.Dr. Greger does not recommend consumption of these foods http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/coconut-milk/ http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/coconut-oil/I don’t buy it.. Coconuts have had a bad rep for YEARS.. decades even.. BUT.. ..only in areas where they are not a common thing.The fats in coconuts are GOOD fats, like the fat in fish. Coconuts are a staple food source in the areas they are produced for a reason. RAW coconut milk is nothing more than the coconut meat itself thrown in a blender with WATER and then squeezed.. coconut MEAT is good for.. water is good for you… tell me where the bad part is?A big one to show how OFF many scientists were… many simply compared it to a regular tree nut and simply attributed the health properties of tree nuts to coconuts without research… a coconut is more closely related to cherries and peaches than they are to a walnut/almond… hence why most who have nut allergies are NOT allergic to coconuts. Those with latex allergies are more likely to have a reaction with coconuts than those with nut allergies.Look at the REAL science behind a coconut.. they are an AMAZING food!Coconut fat is actually very high in saturated fat, which is not the good kind of fat. http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/saturated-fat/Coconut meat can be healthful as it is a whole plant food, but it should not contribute to the majority of the calories in ones diet.The reason that the milk may not be healthful is that it is an extremely concentrated source of saturated fat, and a cup of coconut milk has a whopping 57 grams of saturated fat. http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3113/2Whereas a 2″ X 2″ X 1/2″ piece of coconut meat contains 13 grams of saturated fat. Still quite high for the small amount, but not as dramatic as the cup of liquified coconut meat. http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3106/2There is more than one type of saturated fat..Animal saturated fat AND plant saturated fat and even still different types with those..Multiple studies on Pacific Island populations, who get 30-60% of their total caloric intact from fully saturated coconuts, have all shown nearly non-existent rates of cardiovascular disease.Back in the 1930’s, a dentist named Dr. Weston Price traveled throughout the South Pacific, examining traditional diets and their effect on dental and overall health. He found that those eating diets high in coconut products were healthy and trim, despite the high fat concentration in their diet, and that heart disease was virtually non-existent.Similarly, in 1981, researchers studied populations of two Polynesian atolls. Coconut was the chief source of caloric energy in both groups. The results, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, demonstrated that both populations exhibited positive vascular health.Look up Lauric acid.. that is the saturated fat in coconut.. some consider it a wonder drug! Because of its unique chemical structure, coconut oil is more readily metabolized and used for energy in your body than other saturated fats.Coconut oil is about 2/3 medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), also called medium-chain triglycerides or MCTs. These types of fatty acids produce a whole host of health benefits. Coconut oil is nature’s richest source of these healthy MCFAs.By contrast, most common vegetable or seed oils comprise long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), also known as long-chain triglycerides or LCTs.Many animal and human research studies have demonstrated that replacing LCFAs with MCFAs results in both decreased body weight and reduced fat deposition.Your body sends medium-chain fatty acids directly to your liver to use as energy. This makes coconut oil a powerful source of instant energy to your body, a function usually served in the diet by simple carbohydrates. But although coconut oil and simple carbohydrates share the ability to deliver quick energy to your body, they differ in one crucial respect. Coconut oil does not produce an insulin spike in your bloodstream.You read that correctly: coconut oil acts on your body like a carbohydrate, without any of the harmful insulin-related effects associated with long-term high carbohydrate consumption!Diabetics and those with pre-diabetes conditions benefit off a fast-acting energy source that doesn’t produce an insulin spike in your body. In fact, coconut oil added to the diets of diabetics and pre-diabetics has actually been shown to help stabilize weight gain, which can dramatically decrease your likelihood of getting adult onset type-2 diabetes.….I could go on and on about this.. again… look at the research done ON COCONUTS… don’t just see it has saturated fat and attribute all you read about every saturated fat!Do you have any studies that actually show that coconut oil is healthful?Coconuts and coconut oil are 2 different substances, one of them is a whole plant food, the other one is pure fat.Coconuts do not only have medium chain saturated fatty acids, they have long chain as well. 30% of the fat is long chain. I have not seen conclusive evidence that medium chain saturated fatty acids are negligible.But when you talk about the oil do you mean refined or unrefined? There is much removed in the refining process.It makes no difference, the barren nutritional value is still present, as is the saturated fat. Although an extreme example, the comparison is similar to organic cigarettes vs regular, really there is no difference, both can lead to poor health.But we are not talking huge gobs of it, are we? Just maybe a tablespoon a day? What about its antibacterial/antifungal properties? Is that not why is is used along with bentonite to fight yeast infection?Antibacterial properties exist among many foods, including alcohol. The in vivo effects of coconut oil have not been proven to be antibacterial. A tablespoon contains 12 grams of saturated fat, which is quite a copious amount. I can see it being used occasionally but a daily tablespoon may not be wise.If the goal is whole food, one could make coconut milk from dehydrated coconut meat and water. It’s easily made by starting with a product called Creamed Coconut which is dehydrated coconut meat ground into a paste. Any thoughts?Old topic I know, but I am a bit confused. I just checked my Coconut milk (the kind that you drink) and it says 5g of sat fat per cup. I checked my canned, full fat stuff (for cooking) and it’s 24g per cup. I know that’s a lot but usually that’s in a meal for 3-5 people, so spread out it’s not too much. Now I’m not cooking with caned coconut milk everyday, I was having coconut milk a lot in tea, smoothies, cereal etc but switched to soy milk for smoothies and and cereal and just use coconut milk for my tea. I also have a cup of dark chocolate coconut milk now and then (maybe every 2-3 days). Is this too much? Am I at risk? I make about 85-90% of the food I eat. I do use oil in my cooking, but not an excessive amount. Thanks!What about young coconut yougurt? I like to make my own coconut yougurt from the flesh of a young coconut and the coconut water. I hope it’s safe since it is a whole food …I suffer from severe depression and once I began incorporating coconut milk, which I make at home, fresh, every week, the benefits have been awesome……No talk of coconut oil in the video? What’s the difference between refined and unrefined besides flavour?Thank you so much for all the information you put on the internet and the time you put into it. Can i assume from the information in this video that eating a hand full or 2 of desiccated coconut a day along with my whole plant foods based diet will not injure my arteries and will allow me to use the extra fat as fuel? P.S. Finding it hard to consume enough calories for my active lifestyle.Hi Sam, be weary. Coconut is a high saturated fat food. A little can contribute significantly to your saturated fat intake and raise cholesterol. If you want to consume enough calories it is preferable to rely on starches, not fat, as your primary fuel source. http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3106/2Thanks so much for the fast reply ToxinsWhat about home-made coconut milk made from coconut flakes?

Got this from todays vid 5/25/12.  This is fantastic!! Guess what I just added to my arsenal in my Pysical Exams.  I was never taught this in residency by my FM, IM or Card Docs!!! I pose a question:  What about a fib?  I have been in Cardiology for 20 years now, doing Cardiac Ultrasound (now I read them instead of doing them) but all those years I have always heard the Docs and Coumadin nurses tell the “Rat Poison” patients to not eat any kind of leafy greens because of the Vit K (I won’t go into the physiology for the sake of briefness–Ha Ha). Now this never made sense to me because why would I put someone on a drug and tell them now you can’t have anything green in your diet.  I guess that’s good if we like to promote cancer, heart disease, diabetes, dementia but I did have one Attending in residency that made me see the light!  You can have all the leafy greens you want you just have to eat it consistently.  Meaning if you have 3 servings of Kale a week then you have 3 servings everyweek.  This stabalize the INR and you will now be preventing diseases.But what about Atrial Fibrillation?  Do leafy greens help regulate heart rate and rhythm?  Well regardless of what the science shows (unless it’s detrimental)  I will continue to recommend greens to my patients diets and especially to my anticoagulated patients (In a consistent manner).I am always amazed at what the science shows and what is taught in medicine.  It seems that myth’s perpetuate but the truth gets lost ;-{You are correct in that for those on Coumadin, week-to-week consistency is the key with foods that are high in vitamin K: Particularly cooked greens (collard, kale, Swiss chard), broccoli, Brussels sprouts and other foods containing more than 100 mcg (micrograms) per serving.  The DRIs for vitamin K is approx 100 mcg/day for men and 80 mcg/day for women.  Since vitamin K is fat soluble, it is appropriate just to average the amount consumed over 1 week and to make sure it approximates the minimum DRI per day. The dark leafy greens are some of the most nutritionally dense foods and they contribute powerful and important antioxidants.  However, the issue can become a bit of a balancing act for those on Coumadin.  Even if one is consistent in their intake of foods high in vitamin K, if they consume several servings a week, they may need higher doses of Coumadin. On the other hand, and JUST as importantly, if they don’t get ENOUGH vitamin K; for example in some people who do not eat a plant centered diet, who do not regularly consume foods high in vitamin K, they can become deficient and require another reliable source (such as a vitamin K containing commercial nutrition supplement like Boost or Ensure), as vitamin K is necessary for blood clotting, and internal bleeding can be a real risk and dangerous for those who are deficient in vitamin K who are on Coumadin.  Yet another reason to embrace a plant strong/vegan lifestyle!  Thank You HemoDynamic MD, for your excellent questionI am not certain, however, about the effect of leafy greens on a fib.  Still, I hope the above information helps!  M.Harris, RD, LDThe information does help.  But I would rather my patients eat leafy greens than Boost or Ensure which are loaded with the milk protein Casein.  So you are correct keep adding the greens!  You said Plant Strong–Any relation to Engine 2 diet?Can you get too much greens? What if my diet is primarily broccoli, spinach, kale, romaine, etc.?We indeed can, check out this video showing how much is too much. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/overdosing-on-greens/Your lifestyle should include Starch as the center of your meal (Rice, Pasta, Beans, Potatoes, Corn, Quinoa, etc) and the Vegetables should complement the dish.  This way you won’t overdo the greens; however, if you steam them then you tend to deactivate the toxic phytochemicals that are known to cause problems.  As Toxins stated in his link to the “How much is Too much” Video from NF.org.Husband had stent placed 6 months ago, consequently adopted vegan diet; Happily and committed to the diet. We want to take our supplements – Calm (powered magnesium 350-700mg @ noc), D3 3000/ day, Niacin 500mg day- but cardio dr says NO! Husband prescribed associated cardiac meds- ASA 81mg, effient, metropolol, lisinopril,amolodapine, clonadine. Will not take statins ordered or zetia; but cholesterol # are TC=149, LDL=80. Triclycerides have gone up, 149 to current 214. We want to take our supplements and think they may help esp. to lower triglycerides. We want to understand. We are not fighting the meds (except stains) because we believe diet and nutrition is key.What do we need to know to be able to speak about this- or are his necessary meds and the supplements just contraindicated together? Any pointers appreciated!I’ve been lowering my bp by successful weight loss (35 lbs) and vegan diet since March 15. But the bp still got higher in the pm. Today I prepared a Chai tea type beverage without the caffeine and now notice (it’s evening) that my bp did not rise. It’s 107/68, heart rate 65. I’m 72. This is a delicious hot “tea” substitute because caffeine makes my bp go through the roof. I’m calling it Chai (Hebrew for “life” and sounds like “Chai” a little) 1/4 tsp of each of the following – cinnamon, ground cloves, cardamom, mace, nutmeg, ground ginger, baking cocoa 1/2 tsp milled flaxseed (gives drink a creamy texture) pinch cayenne (red pepper) Put this in a cup of 1/2 water 1/2 cranberry juice and Nuke it until piping hot, StirWhat foods have iodine in them?Dr. Greger shows this herehttp://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2/Thanks so much for all your great work, especially the heart, atrial fibrillation and joint pain info! Many members of my family have atrial fibrillation which seems to be the familial type. I just downloaded your Vol 16 DVD and it is great! Any additional info on the above topics will be greatly appreciated!!! I’m telling all my friends about your info on cancer and all topics. I have been 90% vegan for almost 2 years but still have atrial fib and recently developed knee pain also so I may have to eliminate the dark fish, up the antioxidant intake, etc.Dennis: Some people go vegan cold turkey. Others take a path. That last 10% is do-able once you are motivated. It sounds like you are very motivated. I’m not an expert, but from what I have seen, you have a good chance at success following Dr. Greger’s nutritional recommendations.http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/Good luck on beating your health issues!Please someone weigh in on heart arryhthmias and low EPA/DHA levels. I was diagnosed with a Right Ventricular Tachycardia about 6 months after becoming Vegan. Since then I have undergone a Cardiac Ablation proceedure (I refuse to take any meds) and now have SVT and Im still not convinced they got the VT. Structurally there is nothing wrong with my heart and although this is a pretty good prognosis as far as the VT goes,, its still pretty scarey when my heart jumps up to 240 BPM randomly . Last time I was at the gym l most passed out. There is one Dr. talking about Heart Arryhthmias occuring in lower fat Vegans due to what he thinks are low DHA levels. I am currently taking a Algae based EPA/DHA supplement. I can’t get anyone else in the Vegan wellness community to weigh in on this matter and I have contacted all the “big” names. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. I am certain I am not the only person with this problem or concern. ThanksSVT is a subject that my husband and I have been looking at recently and more than one person that we know of have seen a connection between their SVT and GERD being related. A couple of things we have been looking at is how well the food is chewed and eating smaller meals with no snacks. One friend had both GERD and SVTs and got rid of her SVT when she made habit changes that got rid of the GERD. I know this is only two examples but it would be worth trying.After seeing Dr. Greger trudging along on his treadmill during a recent interview it reminded me of an article I read recently comparing brief high intensity training vs. so-called “cardio” exercise. Heart rate variability was mentioned in a context which I hadn’t previously considered. When you are on a treadmill for prolonged periods (in a previous video Dr. Greger mentioned he walks 17 miles a day) you are conditioning your heart to function like a metronome, reducing variability.That was the first time one of those puns made me actually laugh out loud.

Now I’m 39.Two years ago I started raw vegan diet and after about a year skin in my hands and both corners of lips began to scratch and got red and dry. Once I got unconscious.During this period I had to stopped my diet for vegetarian or vegan diet for some times and then again raw. I hate any meat. Because I think Raw is the best diet.I ate green smoothies every morning. But i think I made a mistake.My last Raw diet practice lasted 3 weeks until the day before yesterday. I stopped because of stool retention and the same skin problems. Seems lack of B group vitamins. I began to eat cooked vegan foods for 2 days and a have higher temprature and headaches. I don’t know what to do. Do you think cooked vegetables, beans and grains are not dangerous. What diet i must keep continue. What diet is perfect for me.

The video you created about various sweeteners is wonderful and informative. I would like to ask you about two different sweeteners. The first sweetener is Barley Malt. According to Eden Foods, Barley Malt is 76% maltose. The other sweetener is Raw honey/Fermented raw honey. I am interested in using the fermented raw honey, not the basic one. Here is my question: are these sweeteners suitable and nutrient rich for daily use?Thank you for taking time out of your hectic schedule to respond to this comment, I am very grateful.Product Links:http://www.edenfoods.com/store/images/products/nlea/104050.gifhttp://www.edenfoods.com/store/index.php/condiments-sweeteners/organic-sweeteners/barley-malt-syrup-organic-glass-jar.htmlhttp://www.reallyrawhoney.com/category_s/44.htmSince seeing this video, I have been trying date sugar in my breakfast food. It seems to take a lot of date sugar to sweeten to my satisfaction and date sugar is pretty spendy. I’m willing to spend for a good cause (my health), but I’d like to minimize the expense as much as possible. Does anyone have recommendations for relatively affordable date sugar? Would this be one of those foods where it is very important to get organic?Thanks!Chop up little chuncks of dates instead. Whole dates are also easy to use in baking and make a moist product.Sometimes I just eat date/nut balls for breakfastThis does not address the very important information of how the body’s blood sugar reacts to the sweetener. This claims that brown rice syrup has no nutritional content; however, I’ve read quite the opposite and that, in fact, it is one of the best sweeteners as it does not cause the blood sugar levels to spike the way sugar and most sweeteners do. Would really appreciate clarification on that.The fact that a particular sweetener does not effect blood sugar is not the deciding factor on whether or not the sweetener is healthy. Brown rice syrup is composed of about 50% complex carbohydrates, which break down more slowly in the bloodstream than simple carbohydrates but it has all of its nutrients removed. Brown rice syrup is also about half as sweet as sugar but with the same amount of calories, forcing you to use more of it. The reason why date sugar is best is because all of the vitamins, minerals and fiber is still intake.Yep I read the same about agave… that it doesn’t cause a spike in blood sugar as much.The fructose content of agave syrup is much higher than that of high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup contains 55% fructose while agave nectar syrup contains 90%. Fructose does not impact insulin levels as much as sucrose, but it is still not optimal to consume fructose outside of fruit that one would eat whole.Dr. Greger, I am a big fan of the nutritionfacts.org. The other day I was watching a video about the healthiest sugar and you named date sugar because it is made using a whole food and it has fiber. I had my wife find some when she went to Portland, OR. She brought back organic date sugar. Dates are the only ingredient. It is in a granulated form. It even has a warning that there may be pit fragments. When I looked on the nutritional label, it says, “Dietary Fiber 0g (0% DV)”. Why would that be?Hello Luis!To answer your concern, the daily value will always say 0 if it is under .5 grams per serving. You will notice, presumably, many servings for your date sugar. I see some in the upper 100’s. Since it is a whole food, it has fiber. It will just be under .5 grams per serving due to the many servings per container. To see more on serving sizes view this video http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/good-great-bad-killer-fats/ Hope this clears up your question!Maybe the following article will make you happy on top of the wonderful video of Dr Greger:Israel’s pomegranate is packed with health benefits.Health benefits of the pomegranate are well known. Now, Israeli scientists have shown that the combination of pomegranate juice and dates along with their pits provide maximum protection against atherosclerosis (plaque buildup or hardening of the arteries), which can cause a heart attack or stroke.A number of risk factors are involved in the development of atherosclerosis, including cholesterol oxidation, which leads to accumulation of lipids in the arterial wall, according to the team of researchers at the Technion-Israel Institute of TechnologyNatural antioxidants can slow down the oxidation process in the body, and serve to reduce the risk of heart attack. For the past 25 years, Professor Michael Aviram, of the Rappaport Faculty of Medicine and Rambam Medical Center, and his research team have been working on isolating and researching those antioxidants, in order to keep plaque buildup at bay.Dates stimulate the removal of cholesterol from lipid-laden arterial cells.

Now, Israeli scientists have shown that the combination of pomegranate juice and dates along with their pits provide maximum protection against atherosclerosis (plaque buildup or hardening of the arteries), which can cause a heart attack or stroke.A number of risk factors are involved in the development of atherosclerosis, including cholesterol oxidation, which leads to accumulation of lipids in the arterial wall, according to the team of researchers at the Technion-Israel Institute of TechnologyNatural antioxidants can slow down the oxidation process in the body, and serve to reduce the risk of heart attack.

Photo courtesy of Hadiklaim Israeli Date Growers CooperativeGoing into the most recent study, the team was aware of the individual benefits provided by pomegranates and dates. Pomegranate juice, rich in polyphenolic antioxidants (derived from plants), has been shown to most significantly reduce oxidative stress. Dates, which are rich sources of phenolic radical scavenger antioxidants, also inhibit the oxidation of LDL (the so-called “bad cholesterol”) and stimulate the removal of cholesterol from lipid-laden arterial cells.Prof. Aviram had a hunch that since dates and pomegranate juice are composed of different phenolic antioxidants, the combination could thus prove more beneficial than the sum of its parts.In a trial performed on arterial cells in culture, as well as in atherosclerotic mice, the Technion team found that the triple combination of pomegranate juice, date fruits and date pits did indeed provide maximum protection against the development of atherosclerosis because the combination reduced oxidative stress in the arterial wall by 33% and decreased arterial cholesterol content by 28%.The researchers report that people at high risk for cardiovascular diseases, as well as healthy individuals, could benefit from consuming the combination of half a glass of pomegranate juice (4 ounces), together with 3 dates. Ideally, the pits should be ground up into a paste and eaten as well, but even without the pits, the combination is better than either fruit alone.The findings were published in Food & Function, a journal of The Royal Society of Chemistry.​Fascinating! Thank you Dr. I would love it if you added liquid Stevia to your comparison. It’s my go to for sweetening herbal teas, smoothies or oatmeal.Thanks for your question Crystal. I cover Stevia in my video “Is Stevia Good For You?”Stevia can be purchased as dried whole leaf (which I have experienced years ago as tasting awful). I have found certain brands of white powdered stevia tastes great. However, I would think that those who plant stevia in the garden might have the superior nutrition which green leaves tend to provide as part of the package.How about whey-low? It is a combination of fructose, lactose and sucrose, I believe (please check me), and supposedly has a much lower glycemic index than regular sugar because of the way the sugars work together. Any harm?The harm is found in those side effects associated with glucose and fructose. Whey-Low has the added harm connected with milk protein (whey), which, to me, would decrease it’s popularity among health conscious individuals. This product’s lower glycemic index (if it does), does not out-weigh the whey! Research the side effects of whey. See how these various sugars rank in this video: http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/sugar-vs-corn-syrup/Whey is one of the best things you can possibly put into yourself. There is no “harm” from normal whey intake.Whey protein is a very available, very easily used protein… which is why it is used by all serious athletes, everywhere.actually, muskratboy, whey is an animal protein used in many reliable and valid studies that have shown that even a small amount of animal protein leads to a high risk of developing a “diseases of affluence” (diabetes, heart disease, cancer). Eliminating animal protein consumption actually can cause reversal of disease. Interestingly, plant-based proteins do not have the same effect as animal proteins. There is mountains of research to verify this, stretching back to 1909, but I will direct you to the book called “The China Study”, written by T. Colin Campbell. Consuming whey or any other animal protein is simply a dangerous, high risk behavior with consequences.And of course, you know that the China Study was focused on meat animal protein, and had nothing to do with whey protein, which is a totally different thing.They’re talking about meat, man. Not refined milk protein.China study was not focused on meat animal protein strictly, it focused on all animal protein including dairy. Have you read the book? How else, please tell me, how he came to the conclusion that all animal protein was indeed dangerous to health? You are on the wrong site because every one of us will be in opposition to your opinion. Incidently, not all serious athletes use whey. Serious vegan athletes use real food of plant origin, not extracts or supplements, whey being essentially a waste product of certain dairy products from the milk of our poor, tortured dairy cows. You and your serious athletes are suckers for the dairy establishment to fatten their wallets in buying their waste products. Not a thing is left unused you know if it will make profit. I see ignorance in your statements. Why don’t you do some research so you can make educated statements by truly knowing the information coming from each side (plant based, animal protein based diets) ?ok, first off, if you want anyone to ever listen to anything you say, reel back on the attitude. Being a jerk is never going to earn you anything.Secondly, whey is not a waste product of anything, any more than cheese or butter is a waste product.Besides, using every part with no waste is a good thing. Why would you want to waste food?You’re right, vegan athletes don’t use whey. So honestly, we can only say that 97% of all athletes use whey, not all of them. Excellent point.I have heard of leaky gut… Which has nothing to do with whey. If you want to blame all your hypochondria on whey, feel free… but that has nothing to do with reality.Whey protein is the cheapest, most readily available, most easily digested protein for the vast majority of people, and making up horror stories about it isn’t helping anyone. I’d say educate yourself, but clearly your glass is already full. The fact that you think meat and whey are exactly the same thing just shows your irrationality about the whole thing.Nix the attitude, read some actual information, and stop spreading ridiculous stories about a bunch of nonsense.whey is definatley a bi-product of mainly the cheese industry. they used to toss it, now they dont … no big deal though, i personally dont need protein n have always been an advocate on not using it. the person you were replying to did not say that whey causes leaky gut, they were referring to the china study which points out animal proteins, could be whey, milk, meat, has been linked to causing it. i personally believe everyone is different n if you want to eat meat thats fine. make yourself aware of where your food comes from n how it gets from pasture to your plate. i find it ridiculous on how we treat animals in the us, n raping cows to get milk n abducting there young just to raise in a cage as veil or live another tortured life of impregnation n then go through the same cycle , its sick. but either way one thing is true no matter who you are. processed crap like whey or even plant proteins n other processed “food” is not optimal for anyone n may actually cause most these ailments our world deals with. i have problems with the china study . the fact that esselystein or whoever turns on and off cancer. liver cancer i believe, is believable for a rat cause he proved it. but now the “dogma” is that meat turns on cancer. noooo way, thats some china whisper shit happenin from the china study n now the whole world is mislead, even the vegans. how bout we all just believe no one. try everything, even going vegan n eating alot, go raw for a few months, then try meat again, i personally have done this and wont go back to meat. my digestion, complexion, weight , just everything is better for me.. so dont get an attitude yourself there buddy , n be open to absolutley everythinghaha so not tue. whey is very damaging to health. and to the poor animals.This information is wonderful, thank you! I do have one question, though, because I’ve been hearing from a lot of sources that Sucanat is a generally healthy sweetener. For someone that is pretty much avoiding everything that is unhealthy, would Sucanat be ok to use in baking cookies? I can’t seem to get date sugar to make them sweet enough.Hi Veganteen, Sucanat is only healthier because unlike refined sugar, it isn’t filtered through animal bone charcoal! Use Sucanat for your occasional treat. Try applesauce, orange jc concentrate or dried cranberries as alternatives. Have fun experimenting!In the study, was raw honey used? One might expect raw honey to have more antioxidants?Hi, Thank you for all your wonderful videos. What is your opinion on Manuka Honey? Is it good for us? Do you know where it would fit in the line up of this video? Thank you in advance for your reply. Kind regards, BIn some of your recipe suggestions, such as your hibiscus punch, you suggest using erythritol. I am reluctant to feed my daughter (age 6) any artificial sweeteners, even those like erythritol that appear to be harmless. I’ve had trouble finding date sugar, though I do plan to try to make my own. While I realize some other sweeteners have fewer antioxidants (brown sugar) or none (agave), would there be any harm in using these sweeteners in otherwise health-boosting recipes for someone who is not overweight?You always want to try to boost your family’s nutrient to calorie ratio, and those sweeteners are basically just a bucketload of empty calories. If you have a good blender you can blend some (pitted) dates in and don’t have to worry about finding date sugar.What about Palm Sweet Coconut Sugar? Yes, my question also….what is your opinion of coconut sugars?Yes, please address coconut palm sugar, It seems to be no different than white table sugar, with the exception of being less refined and therefore having some nutrients and a claim of a lower Glycemic Index; however, the lower GI claim is suspect as it is based on a small Philippine government study (main supplier).how about salty flavours? Table salt is bad for your health but are there any healthy alternatives?Iodized salt is actually ok, as long as you keep your daily sodium intake 1200-1500 mg or less per day you will be just fine. People who are at high risk for heart disease, or people trying to reverse it should keep their intake at 500 mg or less.thx!Iodized salt you buy at a regular grocery store does contain a form of aluminum (sp?) to prevent caking of the salt, which you may want to avoid, and yes I think Toxins has the mg count of allowable sodium intake about right—so if you can control your sodium intake using only a little, using some salt is ok. Actually, Dr. McDougall thinks the recomendation from the medical estalishment to lower salt intake to decrease blood pressure and to improve heart disease, is used as a “scapegoat” to avoid revealing the real culprit of disease–high dietary fat intake, which most people seem incapable of doing (almost universally). I believe Dr McDougall’s recomendation for acceptable salt intake may be higher than that of Toxins in the comment above, perhaps up to 2000 mg for healthy people.Himalayan pink salt is nutritious.In what way, h7opolo?Why did you respond to this statement but none of the other many questions and statements on this thread? Just wondering.Just my first thought… Could be because he’s always searching for information and wondering if this poster knows something that he hasn’t seen yet.If this is true, only in miniscule amounts. Certainly not enough to warrant using it in excess amounts. I think it is just pretty, that’s all but it does not contain iodine as far as I know.Herbs, that’s really about it, unless you want to try potassium salt (only if you don’t have kidney disease) but I have no idea what it tastes like. As far as I know there is no fake salt that closely resembles the taste of real salt but I could be mistaken. You just have to learn to eat food without it which many people do. Same with sugar, there is no such thing as a substance that tastes just like sugar that is not actually sugar–including eryrithritol (sp?) which approximates the taste of real sugar most closely but not exactly like sugar. It has a minty after taste and is definitely less sweet in equal proportions to sugar. Plus pretty darn exspensive if you use it a lot in cakes, smoothies, whatever on an everyday basis. We just gotta get over our fat, sugar, salt addictions…plain and simple.Jeff Novick who works a lot with Dr Mcdougall, points out that if you read the label on packaged date sugar, it has 0’s for any nutrition, perhaps the fresh food is better. Molasses on the other hand states lots of nutrients on the bottle, what gives? Also, the blood sugar effects of Date sugar are purported to be low but is that because it is high in fructose? Thank you…Yes, the label does have mostly “0’s”, but there isnt much listed on the label to begin with. http://www.bobsredmill.com/date-sugar.htmlAlso, depending on the serving size (usually 1 teaspoon), the values are low and will not register. Remember though, vitamins and minerals are only one aspect of a healthy food. Dates have a lot of antioxidants and phytonutrients. Date sugar is not refined in any way, it is purely ground dates, and dates are quite nutritious.http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/7348/2Check out this video going into detail on dates. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/are-dates-good-for-you/Toxins, date sugar is dried and ground, isn’t that considered “processing?”I would like to know your opinion about honey. I don’t eat it but I need arguments.I would also know your opinion about apple cider vinegar or balsamic vinegar.Thank you.honey is shown 3:06 in the videovinegar seems to be helpful, allthough i dont know about balsamic http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-vinegar-good-for-you/Could you please tell me if Xylitol is any good. I am a diabetic, still have a very sweet need, what would be best for me to use, if any?Xylitol is actually discussed in the video link below, it is considered harmful. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/a-harmless-artificial-sweetener/Erythritol on the other hand is a neutral artificial sweetener.As some other viewers have pointed out, there might be other factors besides antioxidant content to consider. Where a sweetener falls on the glycemic scale would seem to be important. Someone asked about coconut palm sugar and it is my understanding that it is quite low on the glycemic scale, has a high mineral content and presumably antioxidants, and is ecologically sustainable to boot. I can personally attest that it is quite delicious. I would love to see what Dr. Greger can find out about this sweetener. ThanksFor some context, please check out my associated blog post The Best Foods: Test Your Nutrition Knowledge!disappointed to see the results for agave.  got caught up in the raw food mentality.  I wonder if there are any studies for the coconut nectars/sugar and green leaf stevia. If we lived in a place where we could directly pick and eat sugarcane, it wouldn’t be so bad. A sort of unrefined version is jaggery (used in India). http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814609006207http://www.panelamonitor.org/media/docrepo/document/files/cytoprotective-and-antioxidant-activity-studies-of-jaggery-sugar.pdfNice find! I shall check at my local indian supermarket next time I’m there ;-) read the Elsevier article through your link, thanks for that.love jaggey but have only seen it in India and yeah sugarcane is great when it comes in the form of cane juice or just by chewing on the stalk.Doctor Greger, I keep bees in my back yard and harvest raw honey for our family’s main sweetener. It is my understanding that raw honey is nutritionally superior to store-bought pasteurized honey (and it is also lower on the glycemic index). Where do you think raw honey would fall in this chart?I’d be interested in how coconut sugar compares to the rest of the sweeteners?What about coconut sugar/nectar?How about barley malt syrup? It’s sold in my local health food store in the same place as other liquid sweeteners.All of us, including myself, seem determined and desperate to find some kind of “healthy” sugar to keep up our sugar addictions. Unfortunately I am pretty certain all sugars, both natural and artificial, have little to offer to our health. Most are damaging with the exception of eryrithritol according to Dr. Greger, but this may be disproven in the future. Eryrithritol certainly will hurt your pocket book, however!!! Date sugar most likely contains antioxidants and substances that are never listed on food labels, but I feel that these substances can also be easily obtained in greater amounts and less expensively in regular plant foods we eat day.do u have to talk so slowly?Dr. Greger is sharing concentrated information and uses visuals to reinforce this, he is allowing us time to view, read and listen. He also pauses for effect.Can you tell me the dangers of Honey. Some people say Manuka Honey has health benefits? I don’t believe it does, but does it?So I guess my question is: What are the dangerous of honey?I also believe creating honey farms would be a environmental problem. Can you also tell me the environmental dangerous of honey?To me I think the dangerous to the environment look obvious. Bees are the main pollinator of plants our main food supply.The reason I see it as a environmental problem is if honey bees are manipulated to eat sugar rather than there own honey, it will lead them to no longer bothering with getting pollen as they don’t need it and lead them to just looking for fruit and sugar cane sources.Based on this I don’t agree with bee farms for honey as I worry about evolution of bees. I think this will make them evolve in a bad direction, I think bee sanctuaries are fine, and using bees in general is fine. I just don’t agree with taking Bees honey as I wonder if it will stop the pollination of plants if bees no longer keep there honey what would be the point in bees getting pollen from plants. They will look for sugar sources instead. This is dangerous in my view.It’s not like in the wild where humans would destroy a nest forcing them to build a whole new nest. Humans are creating bee farms and manipulate the bees in to thinking that this is how nature is. And so they will evolve to get the sugar thinking this is a natural occurrence. To me this is dangerous. Bees need to be left to there own ends. With us possible manipulating where they get the pollen from but not stealing there honey.Hi Dr Gregor,Some of these results were surprising, so I started to look into it more.What about other methods for measuring antioxidant activity? Your ranking was based on FRAP, but what about oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC)? I’ve seen high ORAC values published for maple syrup et al and I have found studies showing very disparate values for FRAP and ORAC for the same food (e.g. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12009973).thanks!Since date sugar does not dissolve, and is thus useless in coffee or tea, and burns easily making baking or cooking with it problematic, it looks like the best use for it is sprinkled over my morning oatmeal. What I take from this – and it is purely my own opinion – is that most sweeteners are wasted calories if natural or a health threat if artificial. It seems to me that the best thing we can do is retrain our taste buds to enjoy the natural flavors in real food, rather than catering to a ‘sweet tooth’ which is essentially an atavistic response dating from times when we were all hunter/gatherers. Just as our tendency to look for salty flavors, once vital to our healthy balance, has been exploited by the food industry, so has our fondness for sweetness.Finally! Can’t say that any better!Hi Doc. On a separate note–it would be really interesting if you would provide us with some info about ‘carrageenan’. What exactly is it? Harmless or harmful?I’m going to be covering that in an upcoming video–stay tuned! So you don’t miss it make sure you’re subscribed.I’ve been diagnosed with IBS, about 4 years ago I started having bad inflammation and burning in one area of my large intestine – around the sigmoid area. CT, Ultrasound, 2 colonoscopies found nothing wrong. I did many kinds of rule out diets, and was telling my 2nd GI’s partner about how I realized it sounded a bit crazy, but the only pattern I picked up on with the rule-outs was the “IBS-attack” seemed to follow commercial foods. He replied that he didn’t think it sounded crazy, as he himself suffered from food-additive sensitivities.He said at that time, there were no tests to figure out which additives might cause our sensitivities, so first I had to go on a whole, natural diet just to see if the attacks stopped. Then I could slowly experiment with commercial foods to see if they caused me problems, and write down their additives, so that over time I’d hopefully detect a pattern.After a few months, I figured out that Carrageenan was my absolute worst additive. Nitrates and Annatto also caused problems, but not as severe as Carrageenan. There’s at least one other additive I haven’t figured out – something that’s added to commercial broths, but I’d rather make my own broth than sleuth out more additive-sensitivities, since they’re fairly painful.I’ve found websites stating that Carrageenan is used in medical studies to cause inflammation and pain when injected into tissues, so that the scientists can see if their product helps decrease pain/inflammation. My guess is that maybe I have a patch of dysbiosis that’s leaky, allowing the additives to get into my intestine’s tissues, but I’m not a scientist. Searching the web for Carrageenan problems seems to find few results, as opposed to other allergens/sensitivities, so I’m guessing only a small amount of people have issues with Carrageenan, unless I’m just one of the front-runners.I echo the many other requests for your rating on Coconut Palm Sugar. I have search all the comments and replies below twice. I have searched the rest of the site and other videos. Please reply as this is a popular request. Thank youyes dates :) desert bedouins’ best strengthening foodWhat about coconut sugar?Doesn’t maple syrup have high amounts of magnesium, and zink. You sure this wasn’t a copy cat maple syrup? Using mostly corn syrup?Hi doctor, I was wondering about honey, I know that vegans don’t eat honey, but is there a medical reason to avoid it, other than ideology?Honey is another sweetener that is more or less, empty calories.how do i see the rest of the information?never mind, it went on. :)I have lately started using pure date syrup as a sweetener. Is there any info regarding date syrup?I notice Xylitol doesn’t even get a mention. What’s the latest on this as a sweetener?xylitol is not healthful because it draws water out from the large intestines which can lead to diarrhea.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-harmless-artificial-sweetener/Yes but if you only have it in small quantities, then that’s the only concern as far as I can see, or is my research letting me down? Is it harmful otherwise?re: Date Sugar and Fiber, Once the date is broken down, does it not lose the value in fiber? Changing it’s whole make up of a fruit changes nutritional value right? I believe it would be the same for all fruits and vegitables. I really think juicing fruits/vegetables is not as healthy as we think? Please educate me.The fiber is “disrupted” but not destroyed. Disrupted meaning it does not satiate as well as the whole unprocessed food itself, but this is an issue for someone who is battling weight loss.The fiber is still intact and has the same function.You may also want to note that this bulk order website states that date sugar is an “Excellent source of fiber, potassium, and trace minerals.” http://www.azurestandard.com/shop/product/8983/testingre: Fiber: by breaking down foods’ make up, are we not loosing nutritional value? Especially fiber? How can juicing fruits and vegetables have the same nutritional value compared to it’s original state?Dr. Greger doe not recommend juicing.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fruit-juice-fail/Dear Dr. Gregor – I love your videos and your website. It seems there’s still a lot of confusion about sugars, fructose/glucose ratio, glycemic index, etc. I imagine more videos down the pipeline. I am curious, as others seem to be, about your rating of the sweeteners based on “antioxidant activity” vs. nutrients. While I agree that dates are deliciously and nutritiously sweet, what about the minerals in grade B maple syrup, for example? In your video, it didn’t fare well, which surprised me. And it seems like the industry is now on a coconut sugar craze. Will this turn out to be another “agave” fad? And with all the palm products on the market now, are animals, like chimps, losing their habitats in order to satisfy our collective sweet tooth or is palm farming (sugar, flour, oil) helping the animals? Lots of questions! Thank you!As a (mostly former) gout sufferer I am also very mindful of fructose which metabolizes to uric acid. How do the fructose contents of these sweeteners stack up?where does coconut sugar/syrup fit in?Excellent! Thank you for this information Dr. Greger! KarlynI recently found, in the supermarket, a no calorie sweetener called “Monk Fruit In The Raw” which claims to be suitable for vegetarians and safe for diabetics. Is it safe?what is your feeling towards coconut sugar?Is date sugar still the healthiest vs coconut sugar?I use coconut for everything: coconut sugar, coconut oil, coconut water..I hear a lot of benefits towards coconut products but not sure if it’s true since coconut has a lot of saturated fat.To cook which is better, coconut oil or grape seed oil?Or which oil is better to use that won’t change to trans fat?What about Xylitol? It is actually good for the teeth…Dr. Greger does not advise xylitol due to its water drawing effects in the large intestine leading to diarrhea. This potentially could lead to dehydration.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-harmless-artificial-sweetener/Interested in your thoughts on coconut palm sugar? Thank you.http://www.purecanadamaple.com/benefits-of-maple-syrup/this guy’s voice is hella annoyingDr. Greger is just ranking nutrient value. Agave Nectar is three time sweeter than sugar so you can use much less. Also, agave is very low on the glycemic index so it does not spike blood sugar like most sweeteners – that is a big deal.I would like to know what would be the comparison between date sugar and masarang arenga palm sugar.I’m trying to find the best option for baking treats. I also was thinking in substitute all sugar for natural fruit but I’m not quite sure about what are the effects on the body and more thinking about diabetic people.I would appreciate if you can answer my doubts.Hello Dr. Greger, I just love your site, so information. I go right to my computer when I get home from work. I could spend hours reading and watching your videos. I have a question about 2 of your videos. You explained about date sugar, very good. Then in another you talked about erythratol as the best sugar also. so if I were to chose between the two, which should i use? Erythatol is not found in stores here in Ontario, btw. I would have to order it online. Thank you for your answer in advance! God bless you.I thought you did a study and claimed that fruit sugar was not healthy/had the same consequences as cane sugar for health? But on your website you say fruit sugar is better. Please correct me if I am wrong.Is this video outdated? Don’t new studies show a lot of antioxidants in maple syrup?What about stevia?Got you covered! Check out: Is Stevia Good For You?What a about date Syrup? is that good as date sugar. is this good for Diabetics as well? i am living in middle east , so this is always available and cheapWhat about coconut blossom sugar??The chunks were too much to take with my coffee, so I have been adding the date sugar in before the filter stage (in with the grounds.) This removes the fruit bits, but also I imagine a lot of the nutrition as well. Do you have any idea how much nutrition would be lost through a coffee filter? Might I just as well be using another sweetener?Have you ever done any research on yacon root syrup and the health benefits of that sweetner?Hi would be great if you could also share how Indian Gur Shakkar / Jaggery compares with these sugars3 reasons not to eat honey http://gentleworld.org/3-reasons-not-to-eat-honey/Love your videos, Dr. Greger! Thank you! Just wondering how coconut sugar stacks up against the rest of the sweeteners? :-)There is alot of confusion over carbohydrates both complex (e.g. amylase, fiber) and simple (e.g. glucose, fructose, sucrose). Glucose is the preferred food for our cells. Fructose is metabolized almost exclusively in the liver to a variety of substances most of which are not good for us (e.g. uric acid, fats such as triglycerides, inflammatory aldehydes). Sucrose or table sugar is composed of one molecule of glucose and one of fructose. Coconut sugar is mainly sucrose so can be considered similar to table sugar although like brown sugar has a different flavor. The glycemic index issue adds confusion to the whole carbohydrate issue.With sweeteners I am not looking at them in terms of which one has the most nutrients. I am looking at the least harm done. I would take something organic, without GMOs, over a processed but possibly more nutritious choice…meaning, organic agave vs. a processed sugar product.What about PALM sugar or Raw Coconut Nectar? Palm sugar (powder) was not very sweet and it had a fairly strong flavor of its own that was not good in tea or coffee. The coconut nectar is fine in tea; it does have some taste, but I can deal with it.What about coconut sugar?The one sweetener I didn’t see on this list was coconut sugar or coconut syrup. Any research on th nutrition value of these? I use them in baking instead of other sugarsWhat about Rapadura or Demerara sugar? Less refined, so any nutrients there?Most honey is not actually honey! http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/11/tests-show-most-store-honey-isnt-honey/#.UlNHJIakolBSorghum Syrup has an ORAC value of 1,700 which makes sense, seeing as how sorghum and it’s relative sumac are among foods with the highest ORAC values by mass.I’m interested by this research, but were the authors purely looking at antioxidant levels in the various sweeteners? The impression i have is that dates as a whole food have a poor relationship of dietary fiber to sugar, and pulverising in the manner described would only assist in breaking up the insoluble fiber, refining the dates so that sugar is absorbed too readily. Would this position be founded, or is there research to suggest soluble fiber would moderate absorption?I would agree that increasing the surface area of a food such as a whole fruit to smoothie would cause easier absorption. The dietary fiber though is not destroyed, but disrupted in that you are not as satiated. More on dates here http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-dates-good-for-you/Thanks Toxins, that was an interesting link, i hadn’t seen that video.Dr. Greger, nutritionfacts.org has been my lifeline to healthful eating! You evaluate the various sweeteners’ nutritional value through their antioxidant content? Is there some other nutrient they might be providing? Thanks!Here in Europe stevia seems to be the next big thing as a sweetener. Any thoughts on this? I currently use dates to sweeten my breakfast oats…Stevia has some side-effects. The best thing to do is to go with fruits – whether fresh or dried – like dates, bananas, apples, etc. I put pears in my oatmeal alongside walnuts and cinnamon. Needless to say that it comes out absolutely delicious.We bought Erythritol and tried it for sweetening our tea but unfortunately it’s too expensive for our budget; maybe best to enjoy our tea unsweetened. We had been using maple syrup to sweeten our morning oatmeal but we’ll be using Blackstrap molasses from now on. Thanks Dr. Greger for all you do! You’re our hero!Hello Doc,As some have already mentioned, Date Sugar seems hard to use. It never seems to dissolve well. I used for your tea (Better Than Green Tea?) recipe.How to use Date Sugar? Am I supposed to dissolve in water before using it?Thank you,RKIn our recent Meals for Health program with the Progressive Missionary Baptist Church one of the participants asked Jeff Novick RD which sweetener he recommended. Jeff’s response was “he didn’t care as long as it is used as a condiment” or sparingly. I agree. I would minimize sweeteners and certainly avoid artificial sweeteners http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-harmless-artificial-sweetener/ and those natural sweeteners that have had reported bad outcomes such as stevia see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-stevia-good-for-you/. Of course the dose is also a consideration. You need to use the one that works best given the situation.Thanks Don!Agreed! But I’m still far away from completely minimizing sweetener usage. I used to use Stevia until I saw doc’s take on it. So, I’m trying to switch to Date Sugar… however I’m stumped as to how to properly use it.Any advice?P.S. Does that Meals for Health prog have a web presence to watch?Thanks, RKRK: In addition to Dr. Forrester’s excellent reply, I have an idea for you. Like you, I tried using Date Sugar and found it to be problematic not only for the texture, but also because it’s just not as sweet as sugar/other sweeteners. Add its lack of functionality to the cost, and I gave up on it.So, here’s what I do: I take actual whole dates and pit them. I *stuff* the dates into a small microwave safe bowl and fill with water up to the top of the dates. Microwave for ??? (depends on your microwave and whether or not the dates start out as cold) – say 2-4 minutes? Then poor mixture into a blender and blend until perfectly smooth. Viola! You now have date paste. Store in the fridge and use in all sorts of ways. I find the date paste works great in oatmeal, smoothies, etc.If you don’t have a microwave, you could just soak dates overnight and/or use a commercial style blender.Hope that helps.Edited: replaced “stuff the pits” with “stuff the dates”Ooops. Had to fix error on above entry from “stuff the pits” to “stuff the dates”. Yikes.Jaggery seems to be a whole food sweetener too. Is it as nutritious as the even more difficult to find and costlier date sugar?Dr. what is your opinion on coconut palm sugar?Blackstrap molasses seems to be a good source of calcium too.How does coconut neater fair in nutrician?The video was helpful in looking at nutritional content… but it would be interesting to see how all these sweeteners would line up when looking at their effect on Blood Sugar.From what I understand, agave doesn’t raise the blood sugar as much because chemically it is composed more of fructose. Half of fructose may be stored as triglyceride, or fat, with only half of the structure raising blood sugars. This may seem to resolve a diabetic’s blood sugar issue, but again, it adds to triglyceride and fat. Too much fat can decrease insulin’s sensitivity. Better to not have as much of those fructose-containing sugars.Where does coconut palm sugar and xylitol fit in?The study cited says nothing about date sugar. How can I find the actual research data?What about Stevia?Check this out Jessica: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-stevia-good-for-you/I am wondering if blackstrap molasses and sorghum molasses have similar health benefits. I am looking for good sweeteners I can use in addition to date sugar. Thanks!Looks like you did not use raw honey or blackstrap molasses. Raw honey will obviously be better then fake honey, as well as better then sugar, and I would like to know about muscado sugar. You also did not use coconut sugar or muscado sugar.Are GMO’s safe?What about coconut sugar…any nutritional yield and where does it rank?Hi Dr.Were does coconut palm sugar stand?Thank you,MARLANAIs Lo Hon sweetener safe to use instead of sugar?Dr. Greger what about Xylitol?I use between 5-8 figs Mission Figs to my oatmeal every morning instead of sugar or dates. But my goal is beyond sweetening my cereal, it is to add calcium for my bones with each meal every day. I may also add an ounce of blueberries for their antioxidant value and strengthening my memory, as well as a chopped apple with a teaspoon of cinnamon to calm down the high sugar reaction. Everything is organically grown and certified.Where would Stevia rank?and carob powder?I am only seeing a 50 second video with the sweeteners listed, no information given. Is there something wrong with the video?Yes there is, thanks for notifying us of the error.Hi! I read the study you cited and I don’t understand how you came to the conclusion that rice malt syrup is the lowest nutritive sweetener. Could you please clarify this for me? The graphs suggest otherwise in the FRAP ratings. Thanks, Stacey.Brown rice syrup, not malted brown rice syrup, had one score of .006. This was the NOW foods brand.This is a great informational video! I did not see that Coconut sugars was mentioned. What are your thoughts on coconut sugars?I drink a lot of tea. Which sweetener do you suggest if we love sweet tea? The last line of the video — “it can add up” — is true but doesn’t answer my question. Are you suggesting no sugar if we are big tea drinkers? Thanks!newsjunkie, check out this article on alternative sweeteners from Dr. Greger where he discusses (and links to more information on) erythritol and stevia; alternatives you might consider over regular sugar that won’t thicken your tea like date sugar. http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/07/is-there-a-safe-low-calorie-sweetener/I used to love sugar-laden drinks, coffee and tea included. Looking back now, opting for water / training my palate to like unsweetened coffee and tea was probably the easiest behavioral change I made to reduce consumption of added sugars. On the other hand, resisting the baked apple cider donuts covered in sugar that my local coffee shop carries on the weekends has not been easy :-).thank you!FYI I went to that article you suggested, and bought erythritol. Fantastic substitute, sweet with NO bitter aftertaste (like Stevia) and seems to have health benefits too!I bought a package of erythritol at Whole Foods yesterday after watching this video and receiving a suggestion from KWD of the NF team. I wanted to share that erythritol is the only zero calorie natural sweetener I have ever used that tastes like real sugar and has none of the bitter taste of stevia. I am a grateful convert (and this is coming from someone who LOVES real sugar or honey in her tea).newsjunkie: Nice report. Thanks for the good tip. I bought a bag of erythritol years ago after watching Dr. Greger’s video. But I keep forgetting that I even have it and am not sure when to use it. You have inspired me to take a go at it again.I ended up getting a bad stomach ache from it, I used too much of it!Thanks for the warning. I’m the type of person who can go overboard when she gets excited about something. So, good to know. :-)Hello Dr. I love this site and your super informative videos; this is my first time commenting. I have IBS and leaky gut and maybe if it is a thing at all candida overgrowth. For a year now I’ve tried to eat only the sugar naturally present in food, not adding any kind of sweetener. On the other hand, I started reading raging reviews on Manuka Honey 15+ UMF and decided to give it ago as it seems particularly helpful for digestion distress. What do you think about Manuka Honey? I would really appreciate your opinion as if it’s not healthy or recommended I would rather save the crazy amounts o f money it costs and the calorie and go back to eating only naturally present sugars. Thank you in advance!Dear Dr. Greger, I’m wondering what the antioxidant content of all these sweeteners has to do with their actual content of vitamins, minerals etc…? Does a sweetener like date sugar which is linked to a high FRAP number automatically offer more nutrients than a sweetener with a lower FRAP numer like honey? So is “FRAP” a good and reliable parameter?Thanks for your reply! KarinSo what are you supposed to put in tea or coffee? Seems like the audio in the video cut off at the end. If you don’t recommend using date sugar for tea and coffee, what should people use? The molasses? Is date sugar good on oatmeal and yogurt?Is it worth mentioning that malted products like malt, rice syrup and molasses contain not only elevated acrylamide levels but also glycotoxins?Also, molasses was traditionally filtered using bone char.Two popular sweeteners that I would like to see in the comparison are coconut sugar and dehydrated cane juice (Sucanat).Hi Dr. Greger,I’m a 49-year old heart patient, had a MI back in 2011 and eventually underwent a double by-pass. So far so good. I follow a vegan diet, I weigh approximately 150 lbs and I’m 5,6″. I exercise when I can, usually cycling. I consider my health is generally good and I do feel great about my body and my health has improved ever since my MI; it does require a lot of work, though.I’d like to know if it’s safe to consume any of the following products: dates, figs, date-syrup, bananas, grapes, maple syrup, etc…My glucose level usually fluctuates between 4.7-5.5 mmol/L (Canadian standard).Genetically speaking, diabetes has run in our family; namely, type II. I’m just looking for a % of risks vs. rewards concerning glucose consumption and what’s safe out there? Please bear in mind that all of the products that I consume are organically based.Thanks.Adam: I’m not a doctor and I can’t say what would be safe/a good idea or not. But I do recommend checking out the book, “Dr. Neal Barnard’s Program for Preventing and Reversing Diabetes–the Scientifically Proven System for Reversing Diabetes without Drugs”. That book has great information that will not only help keep your heart healthy, but will also help prevent diabetes. http://www.amazon.com/Neal-Barnards-Program-Reversing-Diabetes/dp/1594868107/ref=sr_1_1_twi_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1424981728&sr=1-1&keywords=prevent+and+reverse+diabetesThe back of the book has recipes that are consistent with the diet that is clinically proven to be 3 times more effective than the ADA diet. And some of those recipes include fruit. So, some fruit should not be a problem. And as for maple syrup, you wouldn’t want a ton of it, but some on occasion should be just fine as long as you are eating low fat whole plant food based diet. As Dr. Barnard explains (and can be learned about in videos here in NutritionFacts too!), it’s a high fat diet which leads to diabetes. My take is: so if you have a low fat diet good insulin sensitivity, then some sugars/maple syrup in your diet just isn’t going to cause harm. In fact, one of the recipes in the book I mentioned above, “Roasted Sweet Potatoes With Moroccan Spices” includes a tablespoon of maple syrup. Obviously that’s not a lot. The point is, that *some* is fine.Does that help?i have to ask was the honey in this video a normal store bought processed honey or a local raw honey, because wouldn’t there be a huge difference in nutritional values?How is this date sugar made?This took me by surprise. I would have guessed Black Strap Molasses was at the top – but it makes sense that a whole food would trump a processed food. I haven’t used date sugar – but I often use Medjool Dates to sweeten smoothies and other snacks. Good to know dates appear to be the better choice! How do coconut sugar or stevia sugar compare? I don’t use either one, but I am curious…I need to research more on this subject but for starters, no one uses sweeteners for nutrition.Is there anyone here who knows more about Yacon Syrup?! On wikipedia they mention a study by Genta et al., were they show “that a daily intake of yacón syrup produced a significant decrease in body weight, waist circumference and body mass index when given to obese pre-menopausal women”. It is also said that “The syrup contains up to 50% of fructooligosaccharides (FOS). The consumption of FOS does not increase blood glucose; however, the root consists of primarily free fructose at about 35%”. Maybe another interesting candidate as possible healthy sweetener?!","['agave nectar', 'antioxidants', 'brown rice syrup', 'brown sugar', 'corn syrup', 'date sugar', 'dates', 'empty calories', 'fiber', 'high fructose corn syrup', 'honey', 'junk food', 'maple syrup', 'molasses', 'organic foods', 'processed foods', 'ranking foods', 'sugar', 'sweeteners', 'turbinado sugar']",There are two sweeteners that are actually good for you.,"For some of the most recent videos on dates: How to Reach the Antioxidant RDA Spicing Up DNA ProtectionPlease feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and I’d be happy to try to answer them.

For the last nine months my wife and I have been eating nothing but fruits vegetables and we cannot get enough of it. The trick for us has been to dive in headfirst and not look back.

Any info on back plum varieties?Dr. Greger, thank you so much for these excellent and informative videos.I now understand that anti-oxidants counteract the effects of free radicals in the body … what I am curious about is if there is some kind of balance … that is, can you tip the scale too far the other way by eating too many anti-oxidants and could that be a problem? Could too many or too much concentration of anti-oxidants cause a problem?Also, apples, pears and plums are good anti-oxidants, but can you get those anti-oxidant by juicing fresh fruit in a juicer, or blending in a blender. Would you get more anti-oxidant density by juicing just the skins of the apple for example instead of the insides which is just mostly sugar. I saw one health fanatic in a documentary who just ate apples skins … would that work and would it work by juicing … by blending or both?Please see these links to clrear up any concerns. http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/might-too-many-antioxidants-cause-cancer/http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/maxing-out-on-antioxidants/doesn’t raw cacao pretty much blow all of these away?My husband has a diagnosed Pylycytemia Vera.

We love all of your information.Just a quick concern that I don’t think has been asked before, at least not that I have seen.As a daily recommendation is it better to eat lots of small servings of a variety of super healthy foods? Or better to eat larger servings of fewer foods and rotate often to get variety?We like to blend up a variety of super healthy foods (heavy on veggies, light on fruit). We like a variety but maybe we should be doing larger portions but smaller variety.Thanks!Grandma: Correct me if I’m wrong, but I kind of see two different questions in your post – one about frequency of eating “..better to eat lots of small servings…”. And one about the importance of variety. Dr. Greger addresses frequency of eating here:“A review of the best available science examining the impact of eating frequency on both weight and health.”: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/to-snack-or-not-to-snack/As for variety, Dr. Greger seems to favor lots of variety. It would take more time than I have right now to find, but I remember several videos where Dr. Greger would show that say something to this effect:, “This plant worked on this problem (say stomach cancer), but did nothing for this problem (say brain cancer). But this other food did help with the other problem (brain cancer)… And hence eating a variety of foods is a good idea.”I’m not sure this response answers your full question, but I think it at least partially addresses what you are trying to ask. Yes?Acia berries contain theobromine, the same stimulant in chocolate. This might not be good for some people.Artichoke just made my grocery list for today. No idea how to prepare, but i trust the collective will illuminate this issue.Wade: I too started making an effort to incorporate artichokes into my diet after seeing this video. Not that it was any hardship since I really love artichokes. But how to make them healthy (ie, without a ton of mayo as I grew up eating them)? Some ideas that have worked for me:I often find myself buying the frozen artichoke hearts from Trader Joes. They are already cooked and chopped up. All you have to do is eat them or add them directly to recipes. Sometimes I leave a bag out over night and then eat the whole bag for breakfast, maybe with some well aged balsamic vinegar added. If you don’t have a Trader Joes near you, other stores tend to carry something similar in theI have found that artichoke hearts work great in place of broccoli or zucchini or other fleshy types of veggies in recipes. Not that those other veggies are bad for you. Just that it is convenient to take a recipe that works great and sometimes substitute in the artichokes for both variety and just to get that artichoke into my diet. I find myself making recipes from the recipe book Vegan Casseroles a surprising (for me) number of times. And artichokes are great substitutes for other veggies, including spinach, in a couple of those recipes. http://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Casseroles-Pasta-Bakes-Gratins/dp/0762448849/ref=sr_1_1_twi_1_pap?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1430766883&sr=1-1&keywords=vegan+casserolesWhen I started focusing on artichokes, I found myself surprised at how many recipes actually call for artichokes. Keep a lookout. After seeing you post, I had gone home for the weekend and worked on picking out my food for the week. I was thumbing through one of my favorite new cookbooks, The Saucy Vegetarian, and saw that at least one of the sauces were recommended to go over artichokes. (FYI: This is an awesome book of no-cook, super-easy, vegan sauces. I have made several now and rated several as “good” or “great”.) http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_16/186-9165125-4463850?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=saucy+vegetarian&sprefix=saucy+vegetarian%2Caps%2C246My last idea is to put chopped up bits in various soups and stews. Sounds good to me.Hope these ideas help!Wade: One more idea for you: While nothing beets frozen artichokes hearts for convenience, you might find yourself with the whole big thing. How to cook? I have read (not tried it myself), that pressure cookers are ideal for preparing whole artichokes. Some people, apparently, use their pressure cookers for nothing but that. Maybe look around for directions if this interests you.Just a quick question about dried fruit.

And check out the other videos on dairy.  Also, there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos–please feel free to explore them as well!Dear Michael, What is the truth on dairy causing osteoporosis due to its high acidity level, which creates a new loss of calcium, leeching calcium from the bones to balance the acidity in the body. So when you say Americans get most of their calcium from dairy, does this mean that the calcium is counter beneficial?Dr. Gregor, is it safe to use a plant sourced calcium supplement to help us along? How much Calcium is too much? Thanks!What is it you were saying about yogurt not providing the proper pro biotics? Something about them excreting the body?This is a great video.Is there any difference between the type of calcium in dairy and the calcium in plants?  Since plant protein and animal protein are not the same, I’m wondering about the plant vs. animal calcium.  Any difference, or is calcium, just calcium?sir,i am a 3rd year student in nutrition, and all I heard about minerals (ex. Calcium) in plants is that they have less bioavailability, and so they absorb in the human body in less quantity than minerals from animal sources (Calcium from milk).Could you point me to some relevant studies? because I belive you more than I belive my proffesors. Thanks.I believe that your professors are speaking about oxalates, a naturally occurring compound, found in many vegetables such as spinach, rhubarb, beet greens, and collard greens. Oxalates have been found to reduce the absorption of dietary calcium from vegetables.In one study on rats it was found that 92% and 78% of the calcium from milk was absorbed in comparison to 75.5% and 60% from oxalate-rich green vegetables. However, even though absorption was indeed reduced in the oxalate-rich green vegetables it was still absorbed at 75.5% and 60% (1).Oxalates tend to be higher in the leaves of the plant, than in the roots, stems or stalks. Nevertheless, green leafy vegetables such as kale, broccoli and bok choy are excellent sources of absorbable calcium because they are low in oxalates (oxalic acid) (2) and they don’t come along with the harmful “baggage” that milk carries.1) Pankaja N., etal. Availability of calcium from kilkeerai (Amaranthus tricolor) and drumstick (Moringa oleifer) greens in weanling rats. Food/Hahrung. Vol 38, Issue 2, 199-203.1994.2) Heaney, RP, et al. Absorbability of Calcium from Brassica Vegetables: Broccoli, Bok Choy, and Kale. Journal of Food Science. Vol 58, Issue 6, 1378-80. Nov 1993.Excellent study on the calciferous green vegetables. I have been searching for a study of this kind for a while now. Thanks!“Life saviour”! Thank you very much… It’s pretty hard, for me, to see the whole picture on human nutrition when debating themes like this, but i’m still learning.So, this study shows that dairy has more Calcium? I’m Vegan, and looking for peep-reviewed articles that show veggies are a better source of Calcium. I’m confused now.Vitamin K2 (not to be confused with K1 from leafy greens) was shown in, The Rotterdam Study, to reduce all cause mortality and specifically arterial sclerosis, by moving calcium from the blood and soft tissues/organs and bonding it back into the bone. But the sources of K2 I’ve seen listed are almost all from animal products, like poultry livers, hard cheeses, dark poultry meat, etc. There are a few fermented foods, like sauerkraut, that are credited with minimal amounts of it. Also, the human gut is thought to make very small amounts but I’ve read that it might be too far down the intestines to be absorbed by the body. And I read that researchers were surprised that heart disease was reduced for those individuals eating the most animal sources of k2, like cheese. There was a directly inverse correlation between the amount eaten and the amount in arterial sclerosis. So the more K2, the less arterial sclerosis, cancer and other diseases.Here’s my questions:1) Are there any known vegan sources with significant amounts of K2?2) If you’re read the study and some of the subsequent ones, do you have any thoughts about the benefits of K2?K1 is produced in plants. Our bodies change K1 to K2 both in some of our cells and via bacteria in our colon. So if you eat more plants with alot of vitamin K1 you will have more K2 in your body. Eating animal sources of K2 isn’t necessary and exposes us to saturated fat, cholesterol, hormones and persistent organic pollutants not to mention arsenic and mercury in fish while putting us at higher risk for a food borne illness aka the “stomach flu” see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-contamination-of-sushi/. No known sources of K2. Benefits of K2 comes from eating plants containing K1.Thanks for your reply. To clarify, I’m vegan, but I’m trying to better understand K2 because of the seemingly strong beneficial affects touted for cancers, calcium regulation and bone health. I’ve read as much as I can find on the net, but like most things on the net, there’s a lot of misinformation and confusion.Almost everything I’ve read says that the human gut makes very small amounts of K2 and that it’s too far down the intestines to be absorbed by the body. Similarly, most of what I’ve read suggests that the amount converted from K1 is so small as to be inconsequential, hence the reason for the direct correlation between the amount of K2 consumed and longevity. Just as an aside, I note that from the lists I have seen, there doesn’t appear to be any K2 in fish.The reason I posted my original question is because K2 produced these amazing results because of the increased consumption of cheeses, not in spite of them and the more eaten the greater the benefit. This fact has many researchers trying to figure out this paradox of increased cheese and decreased arterial sclerosis, reduced cancers and increased bone health. I’m trying to figure out how to get the good without the bad. I’m not suggesting nor thinking of straying from a vegan diet. Knowing what goes into animal products, as well as not knowing if they were diseased, grosses me out.I know of no good controlled studies concerning improved outcomes with cheese. The studies I am aware of thus far are guilty of confusing correlation with cause or don’t control for all factors. We are hind-gut fermenting herbivores by design so we were designed to get enough vitamin k from plants. As a disclaimer I have not read the studies on K2 vs K1 but a quick pub med search showed only 10 articles on both and none would support some of the benefits you tout. I would stick to the scientific studies. I’m sure if any emerge Dr. Greger will address them.Yes, I have also tried to find studies proving anything about the benefits of including this super vitamin X-factor K2 into our diet, and so far I have found none.My brother who studies to become a doctor laughed at this and said that vitamin K1 is all that we need because it is converted into K2 in the colon. All sources of vitamin K1 are extremely healthy compared to the sources which have K2 (expect plant sources like non pasteurized sauerkraut, miso, natto and tempeh). Green leafy vegetables all the way baby! (one cup of kale provides 525% daily value of vitamin K) I sometimes end up finishing a whole bowl of kale salad because it’s so good.Does your brother know how much K1 is being converted? I don’t question that some of it does convert, but is the conversion rate really enough?I can ask him the next time we meet.Thank you. I would be more than happy if you also could ask if enough of the beta-carotene from food is converted to Vitamin A the body needs as well. :)The best source of K2-MK7 is Natto(fermented soy) with is far more better than animal based K2-MK4You’re right, thanks for that reminder. I had forgotten that natto is a good source. I’m allergic to soy, so I must have just forgotten about it over time since it wasn’t something I could consider. But from what I have read, the MK-4 form (cheese and meats) circulates in the blood for only 3 or 4 hours before it’s gone, while the MK-7 from natto can last for 3 days. Some researchers have taken this to mean that the MK-4 form is more bioavailable because of a “rapid uptake”, and that the MK-7 is not able to be used by the body so it just keeps circulating. However, other researchers have concluded that the liver uses or destroys MK-4 and that’s why it doesn’t persist, and that the more bioavailable and useful form is MK-7. The Rotterdam study, to my knowledge, didn’t include natto which produces the MK-7. But other researchers point to long lived Japanese for proof that MK-7 is as good or better. I’m not a researcher and therefore left needed help. There are apparently forms of K2, mostly from different cheeses, that ranging from MK-5, and MK-8 through MK-10 or 11 (I’ve forgotten). So it’s not simple, but potentially very important.That is a good question, as this vitamin is not very common naturally.But it seems that humans have been fermenting foods since the beginning of time. And many fermented foods have this vitamin, not just natto and cheese. Fermentation has been a very important way to preserve foods, and also has some impressive health benefits. Sauerkraut is a good example of this, it was also a means of preventing scurvy during the winter times in northern Europe.there nothing wrong with saturated fat and there no studies that prove saturated is bad for you even animal .this very idea that animal fat is bad for is a myth….and there are scientific studies that prove conclusively that saturated fat whether from animal or plant(coconut oil0 is bad for youy.Dr. greger, thank you again for such wonderful videos and information about plant healthy diets. I personally have been vegetarian or vegan for 25 years. This does relate to vitamin K!. My younger brother, not overweight, has had issues with varicose veins behind his knee and has had one operation there. Apparently there is a history of artery issues with men in the family. Several months later an MRI found a partially blocked artery in his neck. He was in the hospital for several days and of course his doctors put him on Cumadin and Hezadrin. I am sending him information on your site and on plant based diets but he focuses on the drug use and subsequent contraindications to AVOID Vitamin K from so many healthy sources. I understand that foods containing vitamin k are much healthier than the drugs and believe a plant diet would change his health but he seems to rely on his doctors and the drugs as “necessary’ for him. Thank you for your comments, namaste’, rachelThe drug coumadin works by undermining vitamin K metabolism, and so if you eat healthy foods like greens that have lots of vitmain K you can undermine the drug’s effects. Doesn’t mean you can’t eat healthy foods you just have to have his physician titrate the dose of the drug to his greens intake and then stick with that dose of drugs and vegetables.My nephew had was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the tibia last year. He had 2 months of chemo, a total knee replacement and a further 6 months of chemo. He has now been diagnosed with a chronic infection and has to have the implant removed, a temporary antibiotic rod inserted for 2 -3 months and then another knee inserted. He has been recommended to have Intravenous Vitamin C to hep reduced the chronic infection and aid his recovery. I am aware of the lack of benefit from oral Vit C but have read some positive information on IV Vit C. I would really appreciate your opinion on the subject? Kind Regards. AnnetteDear Michael, I want to thank you for your FB page. I have used a lot of your information for my own knowledge acquisition in my Nutrition Therapy qualification. But some times I feel like I am a lone tree in a forest….no one wants to listen. I have even ended up arguing with GP’s about milk. It seems a lot of GP’s do not understand nutrition or they refuse to go against current guidelines. I advise teenage girls to avoid cows milk and increase their green leafy vegs instead. Would you advise the same? Thank you for your page! :)Dear Dr. Greger, on the same Dr. Oz show you appeared in, one of the topics was about too much calcium intake being dangerous, can clog your arteries and cause a heart attack. Is that the same with calcium from plants or can vegans not really overdose on calcium?Somebody please help, I cannot get enough calcium on a plant based diet :( I ditched all milk products and now get maximum 35% of recommended calcium intake (according to cronometer.com), except when I eat at least 75 grams of tofu every day. But how can you get it from sources other than soy, when the amounts of calcium in plants are such minuscule? From broccoli, when 1 cup has 62 mg? Eat 17 cups of broccoli daily? Or 17 tablespoons of tahini (64 mg each)? Or 20 tablespoons of almond butter? Or 15 cups of dried apricots (1/2 cup contains 35 mg)??Get significant amounts of calcium from greens and beans. Boil or steam kale, collard greens, and all those dark green leafies! Eat tons of them, it will only make you super healthy. And lots of beans are rich in calcium. Eat them up and you’ll be fine :)Hello, Dr. Greger! I am a HUGE fan of your work and website. I am currently writing the conclusion work for my bachelor degree in dietetics, which is a book about the science and gastronomy of vegetarianism/veganism. You’ve been a great source for references and discussions, I’d like to congradulate you for that! So, my question is: where can I find the bioavailability/absorbability of calcium in dairy and vegetable sources???? I am searching and searching but I can’t seem to find it! If anybody has/knows articles that have these data, I would be very grateful!Vitamin K…..Greens…….Vitamin K-1, Vitamin K-2….. It seems the research – on some of these issues is in its infancy…….. But I do think Vitamin K is a truly essential vitamin per se. Saw an article about K-2…../needed for strong bones/teeth/prevent – reverse Osteopenia/Osteoporosis…./VegHealth.com/Trevor. Am hoping someone can enlighten on the Leading edge research about Vitamin K/the need for it/best sources/fresh greens?/Cooked Greens?/Best Greens.Thank you,David KHi, Dr G, i would like to hear you discuss K2 in the form of either natto (a fermented soybean dish) or dairy from cows that eat rapidly growing green grass. I have read that humans cannot convert greens into K2 which has the action of funneling calcium into the bones while synergistically, along with Vit D3 and A (from cod), sweeping calcium from arteries where it is causing all of the problems. This is from information from a study done in 2007 and it seems this info has not trickled down to doctors in the field. Since most do not get grass fed K2 rich dairy or meat and we certainly don’t consume natto wouldn’t this deficiency (along with A and D3) explain a lot if not most of the heart disease and osteoporosis we see?can i have the resources that state calcium in the boy choy, kale, etc is more bio-avaiable pleaseThe PCRM link will have a citation. I like their graph! See if that works? Thanks, Cameron.Dr. GregerI saw that this video states that some vegetables are associated with higher bio-avaibility of calcium, then diary products do you by any chance have the sources that i can get this from, i would like to show a friend. I also hope to stay in contact with you throughout my career, I am in my finally stages of my internship as a dietetic student soon to be registered dietitian I would love to work for your website or any other projects that you work on. ThanksCameron SeguraPCRM has a guide to building better bones. Check out the tables and see their citation. Let me know if you cannot find them. Harvard School of Public Health discusses the importance of obtaining non-dairy calcium sources.Dark green leafy vegetables seem to be a good source of vitamin K1. What is a good plant based source of Vitamin K2 and is it important to get both?Dr. Greger addressed Vitamin K2 in his Q & A. See if that helps? Thanks, Rob!The appointment reminder card I received from my dentist recently included the following “Dental Fun Fact”: Say cheese! The calcium and phosphorous found in cheese is healthy for your teeth — it reduces the pH level in plaque and re-mineralizes the enamel. I did an Internet search for that text and found that it’s very common on dentist’s web sites and even on some Wisconsin (aka the Dairy State) K-12 school web sites — always with the “phosphorous” misspelling and the hyphenated “re-mineralizes”.Do you know the origin of this “Fact” and whether it’s actually true or just some unfounded American Dairy Association propaganda?Not sure?

I quote:“Researchers at Newcastle University in England, led by Dr. Georg Lietz, found 47 percent of volunteer group of 62 women carried a genetic variation that prevented their bodies from effectively converting beta-carotene into vitamin A.”If this is the case, it implies nearly half of vegan women do not have the enzymes that convert carotenes to vitamin A – should we be concerned? Do some people simply require this vitamin preformed (or by supplement)?I assume you’re talking about this study? That was over ten years ago. According to a review published last year, “Methods to assess the bioavailability and bioconversion of provitamin A carotenoids have advanced significantly in the past 10 y….” Though the conversion is not as efficient as we used to think, there is no need to consume preformed vitamin A according to the Institute of Medicine. But that doesn’t mean we don’t have to beta-carotene containing foods! That’s one of the reasons I recommend we eat dark green leafy vegetables every day.Hi Dr. Greger. Thank you so much for creating this site. It is very much appreciated.I noticed the bottle of Vitamin D in this video was Vitamin D2. I have read that D3 is the better source for us(colecalciferol). Can you please clarify?Many thanks,Such a good question. Taken daily in doses under 2000IU, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol) appear bioequivalent (meaning they both work just as well in your body). However if your physician suggests you take large intermittent doses (such as 50,000IU weekly, then D3 is probably superior).Vitamin D2 is Vegan….Vitamin D3 is not Vegan….am I correct?Correct, but there is a new vegan D3 on the market derived from mushrooms!Actually,it’s from lichen not mushrooms.Actually, a lichen is part fungus and the other part either algae or cyanobacteria.My understanding is that currently vitamin D2 is the only FDA approved version available by prescription in the 50,000IU doses. I was diagnosed as being deficient in vitamin D and have been taking this form for awhile. Now I take one every two weeks, except when I harvest D from the sun. I don’t know if you can get this amount in non-prescription versions. I am successfully maintaining my D levels using D2, and because I’m a wfpg vegan I am happy to have a non-animal source.Thank you so much for clarifying this, as I often see D2 in supplement powders and have not understood why it is used.What would you recommend as a minimum dose of B6, B12 and Vitamin D for someone following a plant based diet?Hello Dan! I have studied nutrition extensively and can answer your question. Firstly, a variety of plant foods have significant sources of b6 and therefore is unnecessary to supplement. Regarding b12, you can find rather high doses in supplements, some containing %5,000 to %16,000 of your daily value. Its of no concern though to worry about getting too much. If you take one of these supplements once a week it will suffice since what you cant use is simply peed out. Also note that vitamin b12 is used every day in extremely low amounts so once a week will replenish your supply. Regarding vitamin d, you should take 2,000 – 4,000 IUs of Vitamin D2 or D3. I take a deva 2,400 IU vitamin d2 supplement. In experiments, these two types of vitamin d proved to be nearly equivalent so do not concern yourself with what type of vitamin d as long as you get it. Just note that vitamin d2 is vegan but there is a new vitamin d3 derived from mushrooms that is also vegan.What vegan options are there for vegans to get Vitamin D from besides supplements and the sun?There are some vegan-friendly foods that are fortified with Vitamin D such as breakfast cereals and soy milk. Make sure to check the nutrition facts on the food label. But remember if you live in an area where you may not be getting enough sunlight, or if you don’t get enough sun exposure, fortified foods may not be an adequate source of vitamin D. As the video mentions supplementing with vitamin D might be a good idea. You might also be interested in this video, http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vitamin-d-pills-vs-tanning-beds/, comparing two Vitamin D sources. More information is also available on NutritionFacts.org regarding vitamin supplemention which you may want to check out (since not all vitamin supplements are beneficial) such as this short one http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/are-vitamin-c-pills-good-for-you/ ,which mentions vitamin D along with E, A and C. Hope this helps. Good luck!If vitamin B12 is stored in the liver, then why do we get it from eating meat (rather than eating actual liver)?After being absorbed in the small intestine & circulated by the blood, Vitamin B12 is stored throughout the tissue of animals – including the liver. Luckily as we have seen by this video, we don’t need to depend on animal products for our Vitamin B12!Liver has higher concentration of vitamin B12 than other organs. This is also the case about vitamin D, A and E, up to that point that eating liver of certain animals can be toxic or even lethal (e.g., seal, polar bear).How much Vitamin D is too much? Whats the recommended supplementation? Is there any science to Vitamin D as a cure for the common cold?You can get too much vitamin D; since it is a fat soluble vitamin it can accumulate in the body to toxic levels. If you take significantly more than the RDA (which most agree is too low at 400 IUs daily) it may be wise to get your blood levels checked after supplementing for a few months. At doses more than 10,000 IUs daily there may be an increased risk of kidney stones. In the Nutrition Facts video 4,000 IUs daily in winter is mentioned; I think the chance of toxicity is unlikely at this dose. There are anecdotal reports of vitamin D supplementation preventing or reducing colds in winter. I know of two randomized studies that did NOT show vitamin D reducing upper respiratory infections ( Epidemiol Infect. 2009;137(10):1396 and J Infec Dis. 2010;202(5)809 ).I would look into that some more, what exactly constitutes a toxic dose of vitamin D has yet to be determined. Though it is possible this amount may vary with the individual. In fact latest studies show the toxic levels to be actually much higher.Published cases of toxicity involve intake of ≥ 40000 IU (1000 mcg) per day. In two cases an intake of over 2,000,000 IU per day. This over-dramatization of the toxic effects of vitamin D can only do harm scaring people away.Michael F. Holick, Ph.D., M.D. says in his book, The Vitamin D Solution, that while we can get sunburned from too much exposure to the sun, we cannot get too much vitamin D from the sun.It was recommended to get cyanocobalamin but those are supplemented with folic acid which we shouldn’t be taking. I like taking it daily so I’m looking for 250 mcg. Is there a brand of B-12 that anyone likes?Hello Lisa!I actually take vitamin b12 twinlab dots, 500 mcg. http://www.vitacost.com/Twinlab-B-12-Dots-500-mcg-250-TabletsHow much of the body needs to be exposed to get “15-30 min mid-day sun”?Hello PeterGerry!This is an excellent question! Please see my response to GregV at the bottom of this page http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vegan-epidemic/ describing many aspects of vitamin d including how much you need to get on your body for it to be effective.Let me know if you have further questions!What foods/protocol can reverse gray hair (or revert gray hair to original color); what foods/protocol can revert hair thinning/balding? ( I saw 4:13 in this video, and was curious if there are other suggestions).Hi Dr. Greger,I just watched your newest video and it was fantastic as usual. The segment about the adult requirement of 2000 units/day for Vitamin D was interesting and helpful. Can you please tell me what a child’s requirement is likely to be? We have a three year old.Thank you,Stacia MeslehI’m so glad you’re finding the videos useful. The official (Institute of Medicine) recommendation for those over 1 year of age is 600 IU a day of vitamin D. In two weeks I’m going to be rolling out a series of vitamin D videos from my volume 6 DVD–stay tuned! (if you can’t wait, I have a special holiday sale on my Latest in Nutrition DVDs–all proceeds to charity, of course).would eating mushrooms daily be just as good as supplementation or better since they are so high in vit D?not all mushroom are high in vitamin d. The ones sold commercially that have been “UV’ed” typically have 200 iu’s per serving (from what ive seen from white button mushrooms to contain). Dr. Greger recommends 2,000 IU’s per day, so you would need to consume a lot of mushrooms, which isn’t a bad thing. But take note that you should always eat your mushroom cooked to avoid the toxic substance Agaritine. http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/resolving-the-vitamin-d-bate/ http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/toxins-in-raw-mushrooms/For some context, please check out my associated blog post Multivitamins and Mortality!Does suntanning und a suntan bench promote the body’s production of D2? (1-2 times suntanning, approx. 5-10 mins per go) This would be insufficient for adequate vitamin D levels. Please check out the whole vitamin D series Dr. Greger has released. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-recommendations-changed/Continue to push next video once you have watched this one.Hello Dr, Thanks for the Video. I live in SF Bay Area and I am a native from India so should I take 4000 IU of Vitamin D2 or more?Also for B12 There are some articles about Methylcobalamin being better but than cyanocobalamin http://www.naturalnews.com/032766_cyanocobalamin_vitamin_B-12.htmlCan you please recommend? Also if you think cyanocobalamin is bad can you please update your site to have B12 recommendations for Methylcobalamin just for the benefit of community.Fortified foods like cereal and almond milk use unmethylated forms of b-12 which contributes to b-12 deficiency in folks like me with an mthfr defect. It is supposed that 40% of the population has this defect, so fortifying cannot be the answer for us.Upside down mushrooms soak up Vitamin D too! :-) So if you do this then you will also get lots of vitamin D too! :-)You really think turning bacteria upside down makes them produce vitamin D?I think a few biology classes on your part are in order here.Arjan: Mushrooms are a fungus. And yes, turning them upside down helps them to make the vitamin D. Check out the following link and notice the paragraph that I highlight below.http://www.fungi.com/blog/items/place-mushrooms-in-sunlight-to-get-your-vitamin-d.html “Here is a simple experiment we did one summer afternoon in Kamilche Point, Washington. We compared several forms of organically grown shiitake mushrooms, which had starting level of 100 IU/100 grams. We compared the vitamin D levels of three sets of mushrooms, all from the same crop. The first was grown and dried indoors. The second set was dried outdoors in the sunlight with their gills facing down. The third set of mushrooms was dried outdoors in the sunlight with their gills facing upwards for full sun exposure. The most vitamin D was found in shiitake dried with gills up that were exposed to sunlight for two days, six hours per day. The vitamin D levels in these mushrooms soared from 100 IU/100 grams to nearly 46,000 IU/100 grams (see chart). Their stems, though, produced very little vitamin D, only about 900 IU. Notably, vitamin D levels dropped on the third day, probably due to over-exposure to UV.”Hope that helps.Very thorough answer, thank you for taking the effort of writing it. Informative.This explanation actually makes a lot of sense thrue the action of exposing a vastly larger surface area to uv radiation.This is off course something else completely to just simply turning mushrooms on their hoods and expect vitamin D to appear as if by magic. What I took from reading the OP.But tnx Thea, good stuff!!What about DHA? Since DHA only comes from fish (and some sea vegetables) shouldn’t we vegans be concerned with getting enough? Another thing is that I think I’m not getting enough calcium, what sources do you recommend for those? I’ve been taking a supplement for that as well and would like to cut down on those supplements.Sea vegetables? I think you have the wrong idea of what dinoflagellates actually are.Hi Dr. Greger, The link to your blog “Multivitamins and Mortality” seems to be broken. Take care, MichelleHey Michelle,The defective link has been replaced with Are Multivitamins Good For You?Thanks for letting us know!Sounds like a well researched video. Glad to see the (verily unregulated) multivitamin craze (funded by big pharma) isn’t being embraced by sensible Vism. As a new vegetarian mindfully moving toward veganism, i still eat vegetarian dairy products and local, “free range” eggs, so I don’t think I need to be concerned about B12 supplements yet. I’m due for a physical soon…are there tests I can request to confirm I have ample, complete nutrition?Hi Brian, Dr. Greger has a great video on testing for B12– http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-vitamin-b12-test/ . Hope that helps! Best of luck with your transition :)I supplement for vitamin B-12 because I do not want to increase my blood cholesterol by regularly adding animal proteins to my diet. That is part of the reason I eat vegan. The other reason is that eating animal protein increases pain and inflammation in my body, which is even more noticeable since fracturing my lumbar spine.Dr. Greger, the video does not tell me what would be a safe daily dosage of Vitamin B12. I recently heard a radio show which suggested to me that I might be taking too much (1000mcg). Would appreciate clarity on this important matter.I would rather eat savoury nutritional yeast (tastes good) as a whole food rather than a supplement and the brand I have is lotus and one teaspoon is 500% of your daily b12 plus heaps of other b group nutrients as well.I give my kitten nutritional yeast to coat her certified organic kibble every day as a way to reduce fleas. She loves it and has zero fleas.The container I use is 10 years old and has spent most of its life in the freezer. Does anyone know if Kal brand is genetically engineered to resist Roundup?But you don’t mean to suggest that nutritional yeast naturally contains B12, right? It only contains what is added to it, since nutritional yeast otherwise contains none.Hello Dr. Michael Greger! Are the B12 supplementation and B12 fortified foods really the only safe vegan ways to get that vitamin? Isn’t yeast a good source of B12? Much people who thinks they are omnivore says the only way to get it is by eating animals… some admits we can take it by fortified foods (sometimes forgetting about supplementation too but, anyway…) and a few people talks about yeast, spirulina… Well, my doubt is: if yeast is a good (and natural) source of B12, since they and bacteria are the only ones who truly produce it, it is our natural way to get B12, isn’t? It makes me confused because supplementation and fortified foods actually are not natural sources, if we look closer, up because: 1) Men has to produce it (it isn’t naturally present in nature); 2) Their production is not sustainable because of the plastic/glass bottles and all the artificial things used to its production and transport, so it has an impact in nature (significant or not) ; 3) The reason of the cheap production of cyanocobalamin is its (little) content of cyanide. I am on the 10th grade, and, my school’s biology manual says yeast are present in places rich in sugars and on the peels of juicy fruits such as red grapes, what lets me pre-conclude that eating those fruits is the natural way to us to get B12. Can clarify my doubt?thank you for all your info!! my question is, if i cant find b12 in pill form but i have found it injectable,- bottles of 1000mg,is that ok?¿ thank youAre there any other supplements that you recommend for vegans or any lab tests that should be done to check for deficiencies ? In the past (in your video about a 40 year old vegan dying from a heart attack), you also recommended DHA for pregnant breastfeeding women and recommendations for vegans including calcium, iodine, iron, selenium, zinc, and omega 3s (from flax seeds). The flax seed supplementation seems rather easy, but the other minerals may be more difficult to regulate. What do you think of the over the counter vegan vitamin supplements such as “Deva”?Supplementing all bread (in Australia, don’t know about the US) with folate dramatically reduced incidence of birth defects in children. I think mandatory grain supplementation with B12 would be a good idea considering that it is getting harder and harder for anyone on any diet to meet their requirements.Loving all your videos. This one came just in time for me, as I’ve recently been diagnosed as D deficient (21.5 on my blood work, with a bare minimum of 25 recommended, and 50 even better). I’m a no-oil vegan and already take B12. Recently I read that we should always take D3 with K2. Leafy greens aren’t enough, as the K1 in them doesn’t easily convert to K2 in the body. I have found a supplement that provides d3, k2, calcium and magnesium. But the calcium makes me nervous, given recent studies. Any ideas?Please give me a tremendous help!I have 60 years and I need to try to have a reasonable life.My question is about supplements that I take, everyday:– Astaxanthin 5mg,– Pine Bark Extract (Pycnogenol) 100mg– Gingko Biloba – standardized extract (24mg Gingkoflavona glycosides and terpenes lactones 6mg), and– Coenzyme Q10 100mg.Is correct consuming these supplements? Or am I just spoiling the money and health?I also use other substances which are foods, not supplements, like Tumeric Curcumin, currently in capsule, 50mg (95% curcuminoids), but I will go to consume it in biological powder.I am thinking consume Peruvian Maca powder, bio, because, also, I suffer from erectile dysfunction after I get widowed, in August 2013.I appreciate with all my heart your possible help.I have published your work on social networks and will continue to do so, with all my enthusiasm.My thanks for the good you do to all people who have a little common sense in his head.Thank you so much.I have 60 years and I need to try to have a reasonable life.My question is about supplements that I take, everyday:– Astaxanthin 5mg,– Pine Bark Extract (Pycnogenol) 100mg– Gingko Biloba – standardized extract (24mg Gingkoflavona glycosides and terpenes lactones 6mg), and– Coenzyme Q10 100mg.Is correct consuming these supplements?

If not, what supplements do you recommend during pregnancy and how much of each? Would you recommend the same while breastfeeding?I have been looking everywhere for an answer but cannot find a satisfying one that answers all aspects. Since your videos are always spot on, I thought you would be the one to ask.Thank you so much!Dr. Greger, My thumb nail grows with a split and the corners of my mouth are raw. Am I deficient in B12, D or what? Thank you for your wonderful videos and articles and hopefully the answer to my lack.So other than B12 and Vitamin D all other vitamins are useless does this include Co enzyme Q!0? With depleted soils and chemicals how can we get the nutrition needed as organic is not always avaiable?What about Vitamin supplments prepared with whole foods? such as these?http://www.amazon.com/Garden-Life-mykind-Organics-Organic/dp/B00K5NELNE/ref=gb1h_tit_c-6_9042_1daa26a4_ttl?ie=UTF8&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&s=hpcI would say we need clinical data on them and even then I am not sure “whole-food” supplements can trump real, whole, plant foods. Just my take. Thanks for asking, Jordan.Can my well water be lab or otherwise tested for B12? In this part of the country, a large part of the rural population drinks from their own wells.

It has always been thick and healthy but has now developed a lot more curl. I’m 67 years old and don’t know what changes may be natural with age and what may be nutrition related. More natural curl?Healthy diet with the right amount of protein and minerals have been known to promote skin, hair and nail growth so you may be onto something!I’m wondering if there is a specific food or vitamins that help nails. I’m 67 and female. The past two years my nails have become a mess. They break easily and have changed in appearance. They have long lines.Dr. Greger has a page on skin health. Typical nutrients that aid nail growth are protein, B vitamins, and other minerals. I do not think supplements are needed, but a healthful diet chalk-full of fiber, adequate protein, and vitamins/minerals is suggested.

I prefer the unprocessed which I believe to be healthier.Yummy–what a great name to post under a video on chocolate! :) You are absolutely right that alkali-processed “dutched” cocoa is not as healthy (See Update on Chocolate for the graph and Healthiest Chocolate Fix for some other chocolate comparisons). Dutched cocoa can have as few as half the phytonutrients, but that just means you have to use 50% more! Making things even more chocolatey has never been a problem for me, and I just like the taste so much better that my household uses Dutch, but if the taste of regular cocoa works for you, then go for it–you’re getting even more benefit per spoonful!Great info. I am not a chocoholic, but it is fun to have something like this now and then. Nice to find a healthy recipe. I don’t like to use the non dairy drinks so whiz up a couple frozen bananas and spring water to simulate milk. I bought a bag of powdered carob. So far I am not impressed with the “chocolate” flavor. Maybe I didn’t use enough, but thought you might have some experience in using it in a similar drink. would love an idea about how much to use if you or anyone has some experience. Thanks, LynnThanks, Dr Greger for this video!!I agree with yummy, and go for the natural non-alkalized cocoa powder… more of the phytonutrients!!Don’t you mean twice as much?you have to use 100% more.Doesn’t milk block the good benefits in chocolate and tea? Could the calcium in soy milk also block the beneficial stuff?Good question becochic! Milk does seem to block the beneficial effects of both tea and chocolate (and even berries, see http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/nutrient-blocking-effects-of-dairy, but though soymilk may block the benefits of tea (at least in a petri dish, see http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/soymilk-suppression, no word on its effects on other foods. Until we know more, another plant-based milk (such as almond) is a reasonable choice. The calcium, though, would not be expected to interfere with phytonutrient absorption.Does anyone have a recipe for this or approximate amounts? I am really bad at just throwing things together – I need a jumping off point! Thanks in advance.You can go to the more recent video, A Better Breakfast aired on 1/19/12 see under Amla under browse all topics. Rough start for you 1 cup of plant based milk(soy, almond, rice, etc.), 1/2 cup frozen berries(cherries, blueberries), 2 tsp of cocoa powder and if you add sweetener consider date sugar. The series on Amla suggests you add 1 tsp of Amla powder(we ordered ours online as had trouble finding in our location) plus 1-2 tsp of ground flax meal. Hope this proves to be a good start. Keep tuned to NutritionFacts.org for the latest in ideas for your smoothies…I used one cup of vanilla flavored unsweetened almond milk, 4 fresh Rainier cherries, 2 rounded TB cocoa powder, one dried medjool date and two small ice cubes, blended it and it was delicious.How do cacao nibs factor into this healthy chocolate discussion?

This sounds delicious. What are you views on combining sweet and fat? Many will tell you it is not a good idea… Would love to know what you think… Thank you for all the very very helpful info on this fine page!!!I make Sacred Chocolate and we use alternative sweeteners such as maple, Inulin, and Erythritol. So, there are alternatives out there.Oh I have to try that. yum chocolate healthy stylewhat about peanutbutter and chocolate smoothy yummythis is great doc…. soy is controversial and said to raise estrogen levels… can you please help. You make so many things clearer… it would be great if you could talk on this as well.uma: I agree that Dr. Greger does a great job of making things clearer. There are several videos on this site that covers this topic. Here is a list to get you started. You might want to start with the video: “Soy and breast cancer”. http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=soy+estrogenYou suggest using soy milk here, but isn’t soy a problem in the USA because it is nearly all GM? How about if I use almond milk instead?Susan: I don’t think there is anything wrong with using almond milk instead. However, if you want to avoid GMOs and if you want to get a good serving of soy in your diet, you could get organic soy milk. That would(should) be free of GMOs.Also, if you happen to live near a stored called “Trader Joes”, they say that any food produced under their brand is free of GMOs whether the food is listed as organic or not. (At least this was true at the point I read it. Don’t know how far into the future this will be true.) I know that there is a Trader Joes brand soy milk. So, that is an option too.Thank you for all your amazing work, facts, tips, humour and care!Awesome. I’ve been wondering how I could sweeten up the bitterness of my cacao powder without using processed sugars. Now I know how to and more. Thanks Dr. Greger!The healthy chocolate shake sounds great but do remember: cocoa powder contains caffeine. If you use more than about one tablespoon, then you are getting into the territory of coffee, as long as you know that and are ok with it.One frozen banana, one cup non dairy milk, one tablespoon cocoa powder. Blend. I use homemade cashew milk and sometimes I’ll add a couple of dates and some ice cubes to make it extra thick and rich.Embarrassing! And have I read somewhere that this is a non-commercial site. And again, haven’t you heard about food combining?! Sugar with protein and… more protein (flax)?! Wholesome food indeed!Hello Predrag1970, I see how this can be misinterpreted, but please note we are not advising anyone to choose these brands of soymilk, date sugar, or cocoa powder. The idea is more about giving practical advice, with visuals, on how to include these healthful foods (and potentially cure a sweet-tooth). If you have others that you’ve found helpful and delicious you are free to discuss. I don’t care one way or the other what brands people choose, so long as they simply choose healthful foods.Thanks for your comment our member feedback is important!

Do these dioxins have no place to attach to, and therefore continue to circulate in system, harming body/brain somehow? I am assuming tissue fat also serves a protective function. Both good and bad features of tissue fat, are there?Great question. From the last video in the blog on salmon and our own fat, Dr. Greger mentions “So we’re not just exposed by eating the fat of other animals, our own fat can be a continuous source of internal exposure because these persistent pollutants are slowly but continuously released from our fat stores into our circulation. And they don’t call them persistent pollutants for nothing. These chemicals have such a long half-life that people consuming regular (even just monthly) meals of farmed salmon might not only consume high concentrations of pollutants, but some of these chemicals might take between 50 and 75 years to clear from the body.”So having a healthy body weight is better (in general), but it does not excuse someone’s risk of accumulating pollutants if they are still eating sources directly.Good point. Now consider this. Because of its ubiquity, the vast majority of stored body fat is OMEGA 6. It supplies a continuous excess amount to the blood stream which overwhelms cell receptors. This is the reason that standard dietary platitudes for supplementing with Omega 3 foods will not optimize fatty acid metabolism. Optimizing Omega 3s mandates optimizing BMI to get rid of excess Omega 6 fat.I was under the impression the most body fat stores are saturated/monosaturated and that excess n6 is burned off.Not sure if you understood my question but is being too skinny actually a bad thing, in regard to ingestion of fish, since the dioxins have nothing to attach to and might therefore circulate throughout body unbounded, adversely affecting body? Being too skinny could be bad, in this regard?Being underweight (classified by a BMI under 18.5) is unhealthy regardless of fish consumption. I am not sure the course of dioxins or other pollutants in skinnier folks. You may be onto something, as they may have less space to be “stored” therefore will circulate throughout the body. I am not entirely sure though. At any rate the less toxins the better, and maintaining a healthy body weight is important for reducing the risk of a host of diet-related diseases.I thought BMI was not considered a good parameter anymore…?“Exposing body to algae and heavy metals in ocean from swimming, bathing in ocean? Does the skin absorb this stuff? Who knows, but I think it is pertinent for Dr. Gregor to address this considering he spends enormous amounts space on this website claiming that ocean fish consumption is harmful and to be avoided. It just makes sense.”Joseph, the above I posted on another day (July 29/2015 video) , but wanted you to see it as you might be able to suggest to Dr. Gregor to address this question, being that he raises a serious alarm to fish consumption, to the point where it seems toxic in any amount. At least that is how I perceive his view. Thanks for feedback or efforts. • EditI’ve never seen anything about our skin’s ability to absorb heavy metals. If anyone does please let me know!Published in Portuguese, here: http://nf.focoempatico.net/dioxinas-armazenadas-na-nossa-propria-gordura-podem-aumentar-risco-diabetes/Diabetes in those heavily exposed to toxic pollution such as … heavy metals in fish from the Great Lakes links to a study about GL fish contaminated with organochlorines–an entirely different problem than heavy metals such as mercury in terms of how and where and when and what is contaminated.Perhaps the good doctor could prepare a video for those who choose to eat fish so they can minimize or avoid exposure to contaminants? e.g., light not white tuna, wild not farmed salmonids, http://www.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/guide-eating-ontario-fish.I suspect I was exposed to more PCBs using microscope immersion oil (1970s) than ever I was from fish… :-(Eh? Perhaps the good doctor could prepare a video for those who chose to smoke so that they can minimize or avoid exposure to contaminants?No comparison, but I can see how you might be confused.I see a comparison. As Dr McDougall says – People like to hear good news about their bad habits. Dr Gregor has shown us enough studies to realize that we would be better off with no or very little of any kind of fish. i choose none. The people that smoked when the studies started coming out showing the harms of tobacco wanted more studies until they died of cancer from smoking. Lets let the fish go while we still can !!!Is this toxin:diabetes connection relevant for Type 1 diabetes as well or just Type 2?Mainly type 2 diabetes, however, some research exist on pollutant exposure and type 1 diabetes.

Also, Dr. Forrester’s thoughts on diabetes.As a diabetic I also worry about pollutants.What about Sjogren’s syndrome which often accompanies other immune system disorders, such as diabetes?Michael,I could not find a reference for this statement: “90% of these pollutants in our diet come from animal foods”I did find a reference of dioxin, but to no other pollutants.

Do you know of a study that refutes/disproves Dr Tashkin’s, which is a little older than 5 years (I saw something go by quickly on your video, too quickly to comprehend for me): http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&articleID=0002491F-755F-1473-B55F83414B7F0000&ref=natureCOPY: Study Finds No Cancer-Marijuana Connection By Marc Kaufman Washington Post Staff Writer Friday, May 26, 2006; A03The largest study of its kind has unexpectedly concluded that smoking marijuana, even regularly and heavily, does not lead to lung cancer. The new findings “were against our expectations,” said Donald Tashkin of the University of California at Los Angeles, a pulmonologist who has studied marijuana for 30 years. “We hypothesized that there would be a positive association between marijuana use and lung cancer, and that the association would be more positive with heavier use,” he said. “What we found instead was no association at all, and even a suggestion of some protective effect.” Federal health and drug enforcement officials have widely used Tashkin’s previous work on marijuana to make the case that the drug is dangerous. Tashkin said that while he still believes marijuana is potentially harmful, its cancer-causing effects appear to be of less concern than previously thought. Earlier work established that marijuana does contain cancer-causing chemicals as potentially harmful as those in tobacco, he said. However, marijuana also contains the chemical THC, which he said may kill aging cells and keep them from becoming cancerous. Tashkin’s study, funded by the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, involved 1,200 people in Los Angeles who had lung, neck or head cancer and an additional 1,040 people without cancer matched by age, sex and neighborhood. They were all asked about their lifetime use of marijuana, tobacco and alcohol. The heaviest marijuana smokers had lighted up more than 22,000 times, while moderately heavy usage was defined as smoking 11,000 to 22,000 marijuana cigarettes. Tashkin found that even the very heavy marijuana smokers showed no increased incidence of the three cancers studied. “This is the largest case-control study ever done, and everyone had to fill out a very extensive questionnaire about marijuana use,” he said. “Bias can creep into any research, but we controlled for as many confounding factors as we could, and so I believe these results have real meaning.” Tashkin’s group at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA had hypothesized that marijuana would raise the risk of cancer on the basis of earlier small human studies, lab studies of animals, and the fact that marijuana users inhale more deeply and generally hold smoke in their lungs longer than tobacco smokers — exposing them to the dangerous chemicals for a longer time. In addition, Tashkin said, previous studies found that marijuana tar has 50 percent higher concentrations of chemicals linked to cancer than tobacco cigarette tar. While no association between marijuana smoking and cancer was found, the study findings, presented to the American Thoracic Society International Conference this week, did find a 20-fold increase in lung cancer among people who smoked two or more packs of cigarettes a day. The study was limited to people younger than 60 because those older than that were generally not exposed to marijuana in their youth, when it is most often tried.© 2006 The Washington Post CompanyIn terms of the purported link between smoking cannabis and lung cancer, although doubts have been raised, the latest review continues to raise strong concerns. It seems smoke inhalation is not good for your lungs, whether from a burning building or bogie.Should we assume then, that if one vaporizes cannabis instead of smoking it, one can benefit from the many medicinal properties without cancer risk?Yeah, I agree smoking (burning) cannabis comes along with a lot of toxins. I haven’t found any studies on vaporised cannabis, but I think it’s at least a lot less harmful than burning the cannabis.Less harmful but still shrinks your brain, slows down your mental processes and inhibits your decision making skills. http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/how-does-marijuana-use-affect-your-brain-bodyYour brain shrinks naturally according to Dr. Greger.

I am Raw Vegan and always interested in the options.Pine needles have so much vitamin C that pine needle tea has been used with great success historically as a cure for scurvy. On the other hand there have been toxins found in the needles of some pines, so I would recommend sticking to more conventional dark green leafy leaves. If you want to be more adventurous, though, then the best resource I’m aware of is From Crabgrass Muffins to Pine Needle Tea by Linda Runyon.Thanks, Dr. Greger.

Doesn’t steeping the needles in hot water basically equate to cooking them? Why is that different for you?I eventually didn’t do well on the all raw diet. I am on the Starch Solution and will be for the rest of my life. Check it out.Re Dr Greger’s Oct 27, 2011 reply, the ‘latest review’ he cites states, “there is an emerging concern among many chest physicians who would suggest that habitual smoking of cannabis may contribute to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.” “EMERGING CONCERN”, “SUGGEST” and “MAY” do not in my opinion imply “strong concerns”.This one was ignored: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21859273, which raises doubts about the so-called “strong concerns.” “It has often been assumed that smoking cannabis will have similar long-term effects to smoking tobacco. Several recent observational studies suggest that this is not the case…The evidence that smoking cannabis leads to features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as airflow obstruction and emphysema is not convincing. However, there are numerous case reports of bullous emphysema among cannabis smokers. These findings have not been confirmed in systematic analytical studies and probably represent uncommon adverse effects in very heavy cannabis smokers. There is now additional controversial evidence that cannabis is at least an occasional cause of respiratory malignancies, but again the evidence is inconclusive.How can  “…not convincing…  These findings have not been confirmed in systematic analytical studies and probably represent uncommon adverse effects…,” or  “the evidence is inconclusive.”  be equated to “strong concerns?“assumed” “evidence…not convincing” “findings…not been confirmed” “uncommon adverse effects” “the evidence is inconclusive.”I do not see a case for “strong concern”, certainly not in these phrases by the researchers themselves.Another example is the phrase, “the latest review”, which disingenuously implies it is the only review.There is also no mention of alternate forms of ingestion, such as vaporized cannabis (no smoke) or eating of cannabis, which reduce or eliminate lung impact altogether.The Tashkin study should be taken seriously. The man is a highly esteemed, long-time pulmonary researcher and many controls were built in to the study. I am aware of no followup studies that refute his findings; neither do I see any mentioned here since I asked that very question in my Sept 30, 2011 post. Another reason to review the Tashkin study is that there are studies done since then which strongly suggest cannabis actually fights cancer. I haven’t seen that information in my local newspaper; Dr Tashkin alluded to the possibility over 5 years ago when summarizing his findings.Oops, voted Joel’s comment up in error; thought it was an arrow to expand comments. So, two years late and without getting hyper-analytical, when I read what Dr. Greger (and even what you, Joel) posted, personally, I see several caveats that shouldn’t be ignored. Not to mention, when I see the resin that coats pot smoking paraphernalia, common sense tells me it doesn’t belong in the lungs.Good observation, yet what the BODY does with that residual is unknown, at least to me. In any case, how the body deals with it will not be the same as how inert nonporous glass deals with it. All this implies to me that further studies should be done on alternate methods of ingestion, as suggested by taha and silver17601. The temperature difference between vaporization and combustion, I believe, could be as great as 900 degrees, i.e., vapor: 300-400 degrees, burning: 1000-1200 degrees. In other words, given these figures which I believe are in the ball park, vaporization takes place at a 2.5 to 4 times lower temperature than combustion.I,ve heard that dandylyn isoneof 5 healthyest foods.  Do you have info?For some context, please also check out my associated blog post Breast Cancer Stem Cells vs. Broccoli!Please also check out my associated blog post Fighting Inflammation with Food SynergyShould vegetables be consumed raw or cooked, to attain the greatest health benefit?What do you say about hemp seeds?The amount of evidence going one way…http://www.whydontyoutrythis.com/2013/09/42-medical-studies-that-prove-cannabis-can-cure-cancer.htmlHow is it possible that we get cancer and we can get prevention so easily by diet?Dandelion greens (and flowers) are good this time of year.From the National Cancer Institute, at the National Institutes of Healthhttp://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/cannabis/healthprofessional/page4“Antitumor EffectsOne study in mice and rats suggested that cannabinoids may have a protective effect against the development of certain types of tumors.[3] During this 2-year study, groups of mice and rats were given various doses of THC by gavage. A dose-related decrease in the incidence of hepatic adenoma tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was observed in the mice. Decreased incidences of benign tumors (polyps and adenomas) in other organs (mammary gland, uterus, pituitary, testis, and pancreas) were also noted in the rats. In another study, delta-9-THC, delta-8-THC, and cannabinol were found to inhibit the growth of Lewis lung adenocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo .[4] In addition, other tumors have been shown to be sensitive to cannabinoid-induced growth inhibition.[5-8]…”From Medical News Today, 14 July 2014“Further evidence that cannabis reduces tumor growth in new study”http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/279571.phpThe “one joint is a pack of cigarettes” junk is very old and tired.

Who needs the stuff….It was difficult for me to give up olive oil. There’s nothing like the smell of fresh crushed garlic and diced onions tossed into a pool of hot olive oil as a prelude to making tomato sauce. I had to give up on a lot of cultural biases in order to do so, and now that I have made the transition, I feel so much better for it. I get very flavorful results by simmering my sauces with added vegetable broth or water. What make great sauce great is not the olive oil. It is the slow cooking times which allow for a mingling of flavors.I travel quite a bit for work so I invariably do eat some foods prepared using oils, and now that food just tastes greasy to me. I can feel post prandial effects on my blood flow. My tastes have changed, and I no longer miss it.So true Joe. It’s like everything else about making these dietary changes. I just started using less oil and then realized I didn’t need it. And I agree. Olive oil on a salad makes it just taste greasy.OLIVE OIL, ESPECIALLY EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL IS ONE OF THE HEALTHIEST FOODS YOU CAN EAT ON THIS PLANET.WHOEVER TELLS YOU DIFFERENT IS A LIAR. ALSO EGGS ARE ALSO SO HEALTHY, THEY ARE UNMATCHED..THIS ARTICLE IS FOR GULLIBLE SHEEPLE…ASININE ARTICLE WRITTEN BY LOSER LIARS..i DO AGREE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT HEAT OLIVE OIL TO HOT OR IT LOSES IT’S VITALITY. IT IS BRAIN AD HEART HEALTHY. I LOOK 15 YEARS T=YOUNGER THAN ANYONE MY AGE..NO GRAY HAIR, NO MEDS 47 HEART RATE, LOW BLOOD PRESSURE, EXTREMELY LOW CHOLESTEROL…CHOLESTEROL IS NECESSARY FOR BRAIN HEALTH ANYWAY.THIS IS THE MOST BOGUS, EVIL, AND IRRESPONSIBLE ARTICLE EVER WRITTEN.WAT TRASH!Now we know what Trolls eat.STFU you loser. I am the healthiest brightest person on the planet..no heart meds, no cholesterol problems, no operations, not obese, bright eyes 150+ IQ..you fat pig..wake up loser on meds…probably ride in a fatty chair…so many fat loser pigs in the US. It is disgusting.I think you had a typo there .. should say 1500+ IQ, right?To me it was the realization that this ritual of saute-ing is just unnecessary for good flavour. You are right. It is a cultural thing. Now when I smell the garlic, onions, turmeric and cumin in a little water I get the same yummy reaction. We try to cook the sauce the day before to get the mingling flavours. Life is good.Thanks for the insight. I’ll have to look into reducing its’ use.I think you will find that as you reduce the use of oil that you will have a similar effect to sodium reduction where your taste will auto range to the point where you become increasingly sensitive to it. Of course, YMMV, best regardsSo, that is the reason I have become sensitive to sodium??Oh yeah. When I stopped salting to my food, I got to the point where I could taste the sodium in Spinach and Swiss Chard. I travel some so it’s difficult to avoid eating in restaurants where the food is usually over salted per my current taste preference.Hi Dr. Gregger, a good question for you on this topic: does impaired endothelial function increase risk of heart attack only during the time it’s impaired, or does it cumlatively increase risk the more that it happens over time?Yes. The more and more the endothelial cells are impaired the greater the risk of heart disease. However, it seems that eating just one high fat meal can damage endothelial function, and fatty meals impair artery function, too.So can avoiding the things that caused the damage in the first place, (oil etc) repair the damage? Say by increasing one’s consumption of plants?There were studies that showed REVERSAL of atherosclerotic plaques due to unhealthy high fat diet with lifestyle modification. The answer is YES, healthy lifestyle not just prevent the atherosclerosis and arterial narrowing but following a healthy lifestyle (including healthy diet, exercise, avoiding smoking, managing stress) can actually reverse previous damages.Diet surely has the ability to repair any damage or prevent it in the first place. I suggest looking into Dr. Esselstyn’s research on plant-based diet and heart disease. Dr. Esselstyn published research showing how a plant-based diet can be a way to reverse CAD. Meat can cause inflammation and saturated fat appears to have other deleterious effects such as increasing the risk of heart disease. “A nutritionally poor dietary pattern, characterized by a high meat and alcohol consumption and low micronutrients intake, is related to an increased stiffening of large arteries.” Other foods that may help arterial stiffness are turmeric and coffee.thanks Joseph! really eye opening!I imagine coz the body gets a chance to do repair work when it is no longer occupied with the fight for survival.Nothing new for me, but I’m thankful that you make this video a reality. Now I can share it with some friends. Because every time I say Olive Oil is not good for us, people are shocked. They all believe that is going to do good instead of harm and use it almost with every meal..I was just talking with family members a few weeks ago with whom I hadn’t spoken for some time and one of them asked, “So, are you still eating that flax seed and such?” I then proceeded with the yes, and I’m not using any processed oils either. And the ‘there’s no such thing as heart-healthy oils, they all damage the inner linings of our arteries, including olive oil, etc.’ Obviously, this was a very brief exchange because I didn’t want to be ‘that guy’, if you know what I mean. I was really thinking of forwarding this video to them as follow-up, like ‘see, this is what I was talking about…’ But, I probably won’t. When you are trying to make the point that olive oil isn’t some sort of super-food, you have an uphill battle against ‘news’ like this:: http://www.oliveoiltimes.com/olive-oil-health-benefitsGood luck with your friends! I haven’t made a dent (that I know of) with my family despite years of trying. Probably time to give it a rest.“I haven’t made a dent (that I know of) with my family despite years of trying. Probably time to give it a rest.”It’s so frustrating though to see everyone you care about literally making themselves sick and not being able to share what we know without feeling like a fanatic when you hear comments like “we’re all gonna die anyway, I’m not giving up what I love because somebody came out with yet another warning that they’ll take back next month!” The sad thing is if you aren’t really into nutrition, it’s so true, the media keeps everyone so confused they burn out and do not want to hear anymore conflicting info, so they just cherry-pick what suits their tastes and block out the rest, and I almost can’t blame them. Manipulation of the population ….keeping them fearful, confused and entertained…is what the popular media does best. I stopped the newspaper and TV years ago, and I am so much happier and healthier for it!I really like making a small snack with the advice from this site and sharing with my mom. Some nuts, some nori seaweed, some strawberries or blueberries, some kiwi, some golden raisins, one white button mushroom, and then I feel like we’re all sharing in the Whole Foods Message. We could go and watch the individual videos and talk about the benefit of the individual parts. I think many people might be hiding food allergies or some long term religious abstention. I like to think about Whole Foods Plant Based as an addition, not a subtraction. Good for you getting rid of your TV. I think scientists have a very good idea of what the best human diet would be and how to implement it for human health and they’re not talking. I think with the government fortification programs they realize that the fortifications are too low and people are going to be sick but it’s a compromise and they do not share this information with doctors or medicine to their great horror and frustrations. What medicine doesn’t realize is that people are getting less of the foods then when the RDA and fortifications were created. Less salt for heart disease, less sunshine for skin cancer, less grain because its fattening, and now Iodine deficiencies, D3 deficiencies, and subclinical pellagra are returning.There is what is called the original diet: grains, fruits, nuts, seeds etc. In their most basic nature they were really good for humans. Eaten raw or cooked just enough to make them edible, they are still good for humans.Thank you very much for your post! Are you raw? That saves a lot of energy! I bet it really adds up. I love dried fruit and nuts! I think seeds might find themselves as the next health food. I am really interested in whole grains. I think for some reason it is easier to digest polished rice, which means I must have developed an allergy some where down the line. I think what is robed from us by milling is making us sick! I love the original diet! These foods are all botanically fruits, are you a part time fruitarian?Every now and then (at least once a year) I do the fruit diet for about 30 days, usually with nuts and honey though. It cleanses my system and helps keep the weight under control. I prefer brown rice.Good for you! I am really happy that I found some plant proteins. I think some people are going to discover the vegan diet as a weight loss measure. It’s really effective. You say the fruit based diet is even more effective? I think most of my favorite vegetables, string beans, green peppers, are actually fruit. There are many weight loss programs, but most people gain weight on these. A vegan program for weight loss might be one that could actually say compliance assures weight loss. So you eat fruits, nuts, grains, and seeds. I am amazed that you have found a full diet with fruit when many are talking about how much you have to cut to do the whole foods plant based diet. You have a more restrictive diet without the sacrifice. Your diet sounds really rewarding. Great work!All you have to do is read the book “Mechants of Doubt” about how the tobacco industry co-opted science and used tame scientist to so confuse the public that they just tuned out the health advocates who had the real independent science on their side to understand that the food industry is the one stirring the pot of doubt, so to speak, not the media. The media is just their stooges in all of this. It is in their best interest to “teach the controversy” so as to obscure the actual science. The more that these incredibly narrowly focused nutritional studies keep flip-flopping the recommendations, even if some go against them, the more that the eating public tunes the whole thing out. Or the public does like what you said and only pay attention to what fits with their personal prejudices.Encouraging is the fact that eventually the solid science became so overwhelming that the doubt merchants could make it all disappear with their smoke and mirrors. Then people woke up to the reality of cigarettes and started to change in large numbers. I think the same thing will happen with food. The science as Dr. Greger shows here there is a growing tide of solid independent science that the ADMs and Tysons of the world won’t be able to sweep it back very much longer.Well said, Charzie. I agree 100%. There’s a fine line between trying to be helpful and finger-wagging; no doubt I have crossed it several times. But no more. Truth be told, the only finger-wagging I’ll be doing is in the mirror given my latest blood work. Here’s a fun fact: Hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor for peripheral neuropathy. Who knew? Fortunately, thanks to the WFPB ‘usual suspects’, and help/encouragement from my ‘medical support team’, I have the skills/knowledge/determination to turn things around. We’ll see how it goes.The supplement Alpha Lipoic Acid is helpful in peripheral neuropathy.Thanks for the tip, Rebecca.

People that I can help with this knowledge. Some people won’t that’s their problem. It’s sad indeed when it’s the people you care about, like your family. It’s the way it is. I made my mind about this.Okay, so a HIGH fat meal paralyzes the arteries, anti-oxidents consumed along with alleviates the effect. So I’m willing to eat a number of no-fat meals, but sometimes…. Anyway, it would be useful to know how much fat one can get away with before it becomes a high fat meal and has the deleterious effect. I used about a quarter teaspoon of EVOO (along with water) (minimum I’ve found to keep em from sticking to the pan) for each Gardein burger, along with vegetables including lima beans and a salad with another half teaspoon evoo each for dressing, with toasted pumpkin seeds (2 Tablespoons for me, 4 T for him (low BMI). Does that qualify as a high fat meal? Can you tell if arterial function is impaired by taking blood pressure an hour or two after your meal, and comparing it to a meal with absolutely no fat? I do have bp that fluctuates between normal and high, he has good BP, but is underweight since going vegan (even though a muscley construction worker). I have real doubts about reducing fat in his diet. it was the only fat we had all day except for almonds, flax and soymilk in our morning smoothie.Just a comment on the last line to say that all whole plant foods have some fat in them, so you do get some fat regardless of what you eat if you are eating a whole food diet. Just like we have been trained to think of protein only coming in certain foods, we have been similarly trained by our food environment to think of fat only coming from a limited number of sources like refined oils or in certain obviously high fat whole foods, like nuts and seeds. Neither is true. Every whole plant food has both protein and fat in it, if for no other reason than plants, like us, are made of cells and every cell uses fats and protein in its construction and operation.Broccoli is a good example. It isn’t something that many people would identify as a having any protein let a lone a high percentage of its calories coming from protein and even fewer I would imagine would think it had any fat at all. In fact 33% of the calories in broccoli come from protein and 10% come from fat. Now broccoli isn’t a high calorie food with only 31 calories in a cup, so you aren’t going to get a lot of fat (0.34 g), but it adds to the total for the meal. So don’t ignore that you are getting fat in whole foods.This is all part of the incidiuous effect of “reductionism” that Dr. Campbell warns about when talking about how science is done, and how inappropriate it can be, particularly in nutrition research. The effects of scientific reductionism isn’t confined to the research lab, it has become the zeitgeist of how our society thinks about just about everything including food. And like any zeitgest, it is invisible unless you deliberately try to focus on it and see it.That does not seem high fat. 1/4 teaspoon of EVOO is like 10 calories! The concern with oil is when people go “glug glug glug” and it comes pouring out. No one needs to drink bowls of oil. ;-)I do not think measuring BP after a meal will tell you about your arterial function. Flow-mediated dilation is the gold standard, as Dr. Greger described. Here’s a fun timetable of what happens after you eat a high fat meal and how blood becomes more viscous.It does not sound like you or the other person you mention is consuming too much fat. We’d have to dig thru the studies to find out exactly how many grams of fat the researchers defined a high-fat meal. Let me know if you want exact numbers? Keep up the good work!Best in Health! JosephThank you for this common sense reply. It is what I intuitively believed to be true, and understood why when I read the way you framed it. I will continue to use a slight (and I do mean slight) amount of EVOO when sauteing onions and garlic before adding them to soups, stews and sauces. The info in this video will serve as a helpful reminder to keep the amount tiny.If one goes the Caldwell Esselstyn route:~15% of total calories from fat is what one is shooting to get under for meals 10-15%-ish? I think that was his approximate “safe range” or something?As others have said, many plant foods have some natural amount of fat in them, it’s more just the adding oils for the sake of adding oils that gets folks into trouble. Basically just adding pure processed oily calories with little or no nutritional benefit…There may be little or no nutritional benefit, but for some people there is a huge taste benefit. If someone wants to use a little EVOO with their salad or to saute onions, garlic, and ginger for use in a soup, and they would otherwise not enjoy that meal nearly as much, then I don’t think it is a big deal. “Pure”, “100%, “light” and other terms used to describe heavily processed and often adulterated oils derived from olives is another thing. Good for oil lamps, perhaps, but I wouldn’t eat it. EVOO seems fairly neutral as far as fats go, especially in the context of minimal use as part of a largely whole foods plant based diet.There must be something wrong with my taster. I find EVOO to be bitter and harsh, yet many people rave about its’ taste. In exploring a bit further, it turns out that the biting quality I dislike is the antioxidants! The more antioxidants, the worse it tastes to me. I have read that some olive oils with high antioxidants don’t have this bitter quality (which is what I guess some describe as peppery, but it tastes nothing like pepper to me), but finding one is an expensive proposition, and not worthwhile as I see it.If you are using 1/4 tsp of oil….why on earth bother with it. I’m sure it adds no flavor detectable! I just don’t get the reason for still using it at all….does nothing for us…probably harm so why even buy it and use it. Throwing some ground flax seed into the meal (a whole food source of omegas) ….good to go. Like said in below comments….everything has fat in it. We are so indoctrinated to believe otherwise …same with protein. It’s like saying a few puffs off someone’s cigarette a week won’t harm your health much – why bother really?Like I said, a quarter teaspoon (per burger) is the minimum I found will keep the burgers from sticking to the pan. And I choose to include a little oil because my construction worker is lowing weight, and having a hard time meeting caloric needs. Do you even read the comments you reply to? And for a variety of other reasons I choose to use a little oil. Is that how you speak to your wife and kids? Spare me!Looking at studies like this one: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19632695 it seems like there is some nuance as to how you construct a meal / diet and how that works for the individual. In that study, the low fat meal worsened post-prandial FMD, and the high fat meal improved FMD.Isolated ingredients seem difficult to study. It’s interesting looking the second referenced article which shows a decreased FMD with olive oil. They’re eating olive oil + bread — about 6 slices worth of bread over maybe a quarter cup of liquid fat. High glycemic carbohydrates like bread are associated with significant decreases in FMD http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1139786 I would be curious to see the difference between a bright garden salad + high-phenol olive oil (eg. a normal paleo / mediterranean way to eat a high fat meal) as compared with this bright salad and 6 slices of bread (eg. a low fat control meal) vs a high-fat+high-carb meal like they were studying.I think this is one of the reasons large-scale population studies are so nice to have. They bigger the picture the less minutia challenges meaningful answers. Also that genetics can generally be ruled out when genetic groups have moved about or otherwise undergone significant dietary changes. Every time we get down to lab-specifics things have a way to begin to break down around individualism/exceptions.Good call. Thinking about a high-fat meal, if I have a tablespoon of olive oil over arugula with a handful of almonds, that’s close to an 84% fat meal by calories — is that a dangerous meal? Now, if I add a non-fat starbucks iced carmel macchiato over the top, the fat macro has become the smallest macro, and it now supplies a healthy 2:1 – 3:1 ratio of carbohydrates to protein — does this improve healthiness of the meal?Thank you very much for your hard work on behalf of extra virgin olive oil. I think we should campaign for “cloudy” extra virgin olive oil. I am sure that the Whole Food evidence will continue to come, saying that we should stay away from fruit juice. What about Mormons, where drinking fruit juice is part of their religion? Fruit juice without the fiber can lead to low blood sugar. I think Dr. Greger really objects to the straining of extra virgin olive oil. The filtering. He has a video were he says that cloudy apple juice is the healthiest, has some of the fiber. I think your viewpoint represents that of culture, media, and modern medicine. Extra virgin olive oil seems to be regarded as pretty neutral here, the calories negative. Olives are a super food for culture. So is the Pomegranate for the Jewish faith. Is broccoli a symbol to the Whole Foods movement? Why are praised foods not standing the test of times to whole foods science? I wish plants could be a bigger part of the Whole Foods Plant Based movement. I think you for sharing the empowerment many people feel being with olives.Would like to know where you got the information that drinking fruit juice is part of the Mormon religion. I’ve been Mormon for 40 years and have never heard that. Our “Word of Wisdom” health code actually embraces a whole foods plant based diet although many members disregard its recommendations and suffer the consequences.My sincere apologies for my ignorance. I mean you a complement, not disrespect. I am referring to your prohibition on tea and coffee and meant to acknowledge your health promoting lifestyle. I am curious as whether another American religion, Christian Scientists, use this website as a reading room, given their prohibition on using medicine. I imagine orthomolecular medicine, the use of vitamins to treat disease, would be of use to them. I am unable to answer this question, I imagine they are allowed to take vitamins. I wonder if Ken Burns would make an “American Religions” documentary. America has created so many faiths. Always nice to talk to a Saint.Chocolate is a food with more than a single constituent. Adding sugar to dark chocolate did more than dilute the amount of saturated fat in the chocolate because saturated fat is obviously not the only bioactive molecule in cacao. When taken in isolation, the %FMD decrease due to saturated fat is dose dependent. This says plainly that the positive effect of on FMD was from a molecule not saturated fat that was already present in the chocolate prior to dilution by sugar and the effect of that substance was stronger than the known negative effect of saturated fat.As for high polyphenol olive oil, 1000 mg per liter sounds pretty darn good until you pause and reflect that 1 kilogram of olive oil contains 9000 calories. Even worse 1 liter of brewed green tea delivers 890 mg of polyphenols with precisely zero calories. So high polyphenol olive oil might look good until you realize that 1000 mg/1000 g for the very highest polyphenol olive oil puts it waaay down the list of foods with the highest polyphenol level. [From the journal Nature, the 100 foods riches in polyphenols http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v64/n3s/fig_tab/ejcn2010221t1.html. BTW, this is list is for 100 g, not 1000 g.] The highest food of polyphenols is cloves at 151,000 mg per kilogram. Hard to eat that much cloves at a time, but 1 g of cloves is only equal to 0.13 teaspoons and contains 151 mg of polyphenols. This is a very reasonable amount of cloves in a recipe. To get the same amount from even the highest polyphenol olive oil you would have to ingest 151 grams, 5.3 ounces or 1360 calories of olive oil. Doesn’t seem like such a good source to me.And if cloves aren’t your thing, just put 10 grams of ground flax seed or about a rounded tablespoon containing about 50 calories in your morning smoothy to give you the same 151 mg of polyphenols. So which do you think is the healthier way to get a 150 mg of polyphenols, 50 calories of ground flax seed or 1360 calories of olive oil? Oh and those 10 g flax seeds also give you 27 g of fiber and 2.2 g of ALA (the shortest and only essential omega-3).Perhaps some molecules are a bit more useful for the body than others — melatonin for example, it’s one of the body’s strongest fat/water-soluble antioxidants, how much does your body use in a day? Something like less than half a single milligram. More is not always going to be better or necessary.Do cloves improve blood flow as well as cacao? Does flax? While 2.7g of fiber from flax is nice, that’s hardly any fiber. Isn’t ALA not associated with cardiovascular benefits yet associated with an increased risk for a few types of cancer? Isn’t the main polyphenol in cloves, eugenol, hepatotoxic?I start out each day with a set number of calorie “dollars” in my caloric budget to use to “buy” non-caloric nutrients. At the end of the day my goal is to have purchased all the non-caloric nutrients that I need for the day without overdrawing on my calorie account since I don’t want to gain weight. The converse is also of critical importance because if I don’t invest my calories wisely I won’t purchase the nutrients my body requires to be healthy before I run out of calories to spend.So with each thing I might consume I have to look at how many calories does it deduct from my daily allotment and how much of a return in necessary nutrients do those calories buy me. In my book olive oil has one of the very poorest nutrient return on my caloric investment. There simply are much better foods to invest my calories in than olive oil. Now if I invest wisely, I can splurge on occasion with low nutrient food like olive oil, but to make it a significant portion of my daily calories is nutritionally reckless.Can you point to any non-caloric nutrients contained in olive oil at a higher nutrient to calorie ratio than are available from any other food?That seems like a sensible approach, Jim. I don’t take that approach because I don’t tend to put on weight easily when not consuming meat, eggs and dairy. So if I use a little EVOO in my meals, it’s no biggy and it is still only a very small proportion of my total calories. If I did put on weight easily, I would probably consider cutting olive oil before anything else. Eating extra virgin olive oil has benefits,for me, besides nutrition. I derive pleasure from it. Pleasure isn’t the be all and end all – I love mutton curry too but choose not to eat it. Still, the psychic benefits should not be discounted entirely.Weight is not health. It is not sufficient to simply be at a weight appropriate for your gender, height and build. Health is to a greater degree a biochemical issue than a simple body size issue. Jim Fixx was an extremely lean and fit sick man.Weight alone is not the single-factor, but statistically lean-muscle-mass is the number one predictor of longevity is what I have read. It does seem to be true that all the very old people you see, none of them are what anyone would call fat.Brux, I agree completely. What I am saying is that a lot of people seem to view it as the only factor. As in “if I can just get down to xx lbs I’ll finally be healthy”. If a person thinks that way, they can justify eating anything just as long as they are losing weight. You can have lots of lean tissue, incredible muscle tone and a very low percent body fat and still be eating food that is hollowing out your health from the inside. The shell still looks great, but the inside is crumbling. And the one day the beautiful body suddenly dies, or worse slides into decades of slow decline that robs you of life as you continue to live on.We used to eat dinner every Saturday with my in-laws at their retirement community, so I used to see literally hundreds of very old people on a regular basis. Since we were changing our diet at the time, I really took note of who was healthy and what they ate. There were very few slim *and* vigorous older people, but they tended to eat better (which I know from experience is very hard to do in that shrine to meat and gravy). Lots of terribly overweight people hobbling around the dining room with florid faces and always out of breath that ate cringe worthy food. And you are right, most of the very old people did tend to be thin but also very frail who struggled to manage even their own body weight. Who were so thin not because they ate appropriate amounts of healthy food, but because they ate hardly at all due to ill-health resulting from many chronic diseases and were reaching an end point after decades of steady decline in their health and vitality.Perhaps I have a difference viewpoint coming from the other side. I’m usually on the underweight-side and very active with minimal body fat storage, preferring to eat lots of leafy things and vegetables, while not craving many sweets or starches, where I hit lots of nutrients with very few calories. I hit my micronutrients on cronometer to fill to solid green at around 1200-1400kcal after several plates of plants, and with a multivitamin on top, it’s really a sealed deal. (I don’t necessarily believe that a greater intake of micronutrients provides greater health results after a certain point and full stomach.) My caloric needs for the day are often up closer to 2500-3000kcal, where a tablespoon of olive oil or 4 doesn’t really throw me off at all, sometimes I’d rather eat that than try to eat another 120 strawberries for the energy.I prefer to eat olive oil with food (it’s odd just drinking it), where I usually get a greater nutrient:caloric ratio eating things like kale, spinach, chard, radish, peppers, dandelion greens, herbs, etc with some EVOO than I would eating something like a bowl of fruit for the same calories. While I could eat those plants without the oil, I would then not get enough energy for my day. I do not have enough room in my stomach to eat the plates of vegetables and the plates of fruits, and the plates of vegetables with evoo provides a greater nutrient density.Arugula is great. I will eat a mix salad with 2 cups of arugula and 3-4 cups of romaine with broccoli sprouts (top source of sulforaphane) red pepper, cucumber, green onion, toasted pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and sometimes sliced almonds. With the seeds and nuts I don’t need fat in my dressing to get a boost in bio-availability, so I usually opt for a high flavor intensity dressing like balsamic vinegar and Dijon mustard in a 3 or 4:1 ratio. The nice thing is that the nuts and seeds also bring other nice nutrients to the party as well as the fat. Plus they add a great flavor and crunch of their own.But whether it is a teaspoon or two of EVOO in the dressing or nuts and seeds to add the fat, the key thing is that we both are consuming a lot of very high nutrient density food and so are far outside the mainstream of the common American eating pattern. So I agree with your focus on maximizing the nutrient density of your diet while making it still palatable to you.Sulforaphane is an interesting compound, although I don’t go out of my way to include it into my diet. You get a nice hormetic response that might decrease inflammation and increase antioxidants, but you’re spiking NRF2 to do so. NRF2 expression increases plasma lipids and liver cholesterol, and leads to enhanced atherosclerosis in animals with antiapoptotic effects that might play a role in plaque composition and progression.I’m guilty of doing both — a nice neon salad with all sorts of plants, with some nuts and seeds for that flavor and crunch (my favorite is soaked and dehydrated shelled pistachios), some vinegar, some mustard, then some robust olive oil.Very good thinking! Frankly this video is just like the reductionist thinking that permeates way too many nutrition studies and it is garbage in garbage out. planypants below did a great analysis of this that, to me negates the whole idea that olive oil is dangerous to the arteries.I still come over to this site for the tiny bit of good information it has sometimes, but just like the paleo sites, and many other nutrition sites, the cherry picking and bad analysis of studies, as a nutritionist just put me off. Human biochemistry is just more complicated than these isolated studies imply.To be fair, I think the authors of many of these studies would agree that their findings should do imply wholesale changes in diet should be made, but that they are simply another piece in the puzzle. Human biochemistry will not be fully understood for a very long time, if ever, so we should welcome all attempts at progressing our understanding, outside of serious misconduct. That said, I agree with your general point.That would be a good study to conduct. Interesting how the second one used cornflakes. I could have told you what cornflakes will do to blood sugar! Thanks again for sharing all of this.It’s interesting looking at Table 3, which shows the %FMD after eating these low-fat meals. Looking at those in the lowest BMI category, postprandial %FMD dips down to 8.5 and 9.3 for some of these meals, which is lower than any of the recorded postprandial %FMD’s from the other study that had people eating tons of bread covered in tons of fat.Yes, this is the same result as you have done video/articles on before with regard to the Oil/Mediterranean confoundment. I was satisfied of the veggie-connection previously.What puzzles me is how the NaCl video was introduced with a promise of more NaCl discussion:_I’ve badly neglected sodium on NutritionFacts.org, but that’s all going to change. I have about a dozen salt videos queued up that dive deep into the existing controversies._But then there were none (more). Will there be any more salt videos in the short term? Thanks.The late Dr. Abram Hoffer and Dr. Andrew Saul, leading vitamin experts, write that the evidence between salt and blood pressure is weak and that another deficiency is responsible. “Recent evidence has appeared linking hypertension to Calcium deficiency, not to Sodium excess. Salt restriction lowers high blood pressure in only 5 percent of any hypertensive population, and many hypertensive people are already on a low-sodium diet. A few animal studies show that sodium can actually lower blood pressure.” Orthomolecular Medicine for Everyone by Abram Hoffer and Andrew Saul. I think I’m going to watch a dozen videos saying salt is bad for me. I’m really grateful to it for the Iodine it provides. I certainly would hope to tell people with hypertension to take Calcium, Magnesium, and maybe MSM. The message Salt is bad for you has already gotten through. It hasn’t helped hypertension. I am interested in why so many blood pressure medicines are calcium channel blockers. http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Cook4/publication/13216285_The_influence_of_dietary_and_nondietary_calcium_supplementation_on_blood_pressure_an_updated_metaanalysis_of_randomized_controlled_trials/links/00b495183b337ee27b000000.pdf This idea is not popular in science. The effect of using calcium to lower blood pressure is statistically significant, consistent, but “too small” to be recommended. Bigger than with Salt. The smear campaign is on.If I understand Linus Pauling’s work, on the chemical bond, and I don’t, Salt does not really disassociate into Sodium and Chlorine ions in the body when dissolved in the blood unless the body wants to use either of those elements. It stays Sodium chloride, and probably is excreted as Sodium chloride. When things dissolve their bonds just spread out, but their linkage is retained. The body would have to use enzymes to do a reaction on the molecule. Sodium chloride as a molecule does not necessarily change the pressure properties of our body fluids. Cations like Potassium, Magnesium, and Calcium have that property. The neurotransmitter Hydrogen Sulfide might regulate this process.There are so many conflicting studies, who knows how to interpret them, and who listening to whose who do interpret them has confidence in the interpretations?The studies you quote sound plausible, but the backing arguments, such as “The message Salt is bad for you has already gotten through. It hasn’t helped hypertension.” are not really arguments. Sure, people learned that salt was bad for them as at the same time processed food makers and junk food makers HAD ( or so they say ) to add more and more salt to their products because people wanted more of the taste of salt. Look at the failure, and the awful taste of most low-salt products, such as canned soup.The high-blood pressure thing really needs a mode of test where they take some human population and experiment safely on them, but I am not sure anyone, or rather anyone who make money off food, health, commodities, etc wants to really know what is going on.Then there is the question of – does taking calcium in whatever form actually get absorbed, and does it really help with high-blood-pressure?I watched a documentary about the calcium buildup in arteries being the best predictor of fatal heart disease, and the new advent of the calcium scan to determine whether this is a problem as being the best predictor … used by NASA and other serious organizations who really do want to know. How would you know if the calcium you take in goes to lowering your BP, or whether it gets deposited in your arteries?There are a lot of variables there, and a lot of noise in the talk about those variables, because so far, the noise helps people make money in many different ways.This has got to be my favorite post here. Thank you for your helpful, provocative, informative, moderating, and insightful post. That you would even consider my comment has turned my mind and opened my eyes. I love NASA. I love that NASA wants to help the nation’s hearts. I love that NASA is studying the men who have too much Calcium in their arteries. I am disappointed that this product was rejected by health insurance because it was too sound. I would want a Calcium scan when I’m older. You have an actual insurance conspiracy. Calcium in the arteries is bad. Could it be a sign of a D3 deficiency? D3 can rebuild bones in the right place given all the elements needed. Would you need more vitamin K2 to put it in the right place? Dr. Greger said that phytates, from plants, the leading source of Phosphorus from plants, can prevent osteoporosis. I think the body is harvesting the Phosphorus from bones, literally dissolving them, for energy metabolism, and storing the extra Calcium in arteries. I hope to eat lots of plant phytates as an elder. I think of unfortunate doctors being a victim of this profit machine. They were trained to save lives and are being robbed of it by the drug companies that sponsor lunches. Why would the profit making machine embrace a solution that uses atoms? If you had a Calcium scan and the results are too much Calcium in the heart I don’t think the answer is to use less Calcium. I think it could be a sign of a Phosphorus deficiency and you’d need to eat more Phylates. When I went on high D3 therapy I felt huge chunks of material break away from heart for many weeks. My arteries were either damaged or storing something. Let’s say that Dr. Hoffer and Dr. Saul are right. How much Calcium would you take for High Blood Pressure? Where would you go with this idea knowing that this research would eliminate all very profitable blood pressure medicines? No one can patent Calcium. Would you take 3 grams of Calcium a day? Thank you for warning me that my noise is making money for the profit making machine. I have heard people of all political persuasions argue this and I guess there are some things that the money making machine doesn’t want to no, and we will have to wait. They won’t allow the Calcium scan because it means a specific kind of care for cash cows for the drug companies. They won’t allow cations for high blood pressure for a similar kind of reason, it would involve a real change in diet, not just a line item elimination.You would probably enjoy the book “Vitamin K2 and the Calcium Paradox: How a Little-Known Vitamin Could Save Your Life.”You wrote” “I am interested in why so many blood pressure medicines are calcium channel blockers” Maybe you might want to read both “The Magnesium Miracle” by Carolyn Dean MD ND and “The high blood pressure Hoax” by Sherry Rogers MD. Both of these physicians are putting part of the blame on Magnesium Deficiencies as Magnesium is nature’s calcium Channel blocker. Dr. Rogers makes the point that in order to develop the Calcium Channel blocker drugs, the pharmaceutical companies have to know the biochemistry of magnesium but they are not about to suggest magnesium supplementation as they would not make any money that way, plus they rely on physicians’ ignorance of clinically relevant biochemistry to use them to prescribe the Calcium Channel blockersHaving said that not all high blood pressure is caused by a magnesium deficiency, sometimes it is a potassium deficiency or loss, or other things. But the cause of high blood pressure is definitely not a calcium channel blocker deficiency. The trick is to find out why one’s BP is high, and looking at a possible magnesium deficiency is a good place to start.>> Maybe you might want to read both “The Magnesium Miracle” by Carolyn Dean MD ND and “The high blood pressure Hoax” by Sherry Rogers MD.Normal people have better things to do than read book after book of conflicting nonsense that is obsolete or irrelevant in months, and that just fills the pockets of authors who cannot prove their theses.We’ve seen book after book of this and that and most often they are forgotten and useless, it is a waste or time and money. If someone has the answer to high blood pressure or any other health problem it ought not be that hard to support their conclusions with experiments and data instead of innuendo and anecdotal stories that cannot be repeated.Right, and Dr. Gregor and only Dr. Gregor knows anything worth knowing. I come to this site because there is some good information to be found here, but there are also tons and tons of Dr. Gregor Groupies who are not interested in doing any research on their own or actually searching to see if there are other opinions also worth looking at. The physicians, whose books I have mentioned, have just have much education as Dr. Gregor and often much more. Dr. Dean, for one, has both an MD and ND after her name.And of course you assume you, as a “normal person” are an expert in what is obsolete or irrelevant in months?Normal people had better wake up to other opinions. Like they say in the South, if you don’t want to learn anything, well “Bless your little old heart!” Give me a break!> Right, and Dr. Gregor and only Dr. Gregor knows anything worth knowing.Didn’t say that or imply that in any way.> And of course you assume you, as a “normal person” are an expert in what is obsolete or irrelevant in months?Didn’t say or imply that either.> if you don’t want to learn anything,Ditto, never said or implied anything like that.I’ve been around long enough to know that there are lots of books that say lots of things, and most of them are wrong. Can’t deal with that without making up lots of pointless attacks … not my problem.:/ Hahahaha.Everyone is entitled to believe in the tooth fairy if they so choose, Dr Gregor is only reporting on published studies, not doing them himself! If you think he is cherry picking, as you’ve commented before, read the reports in the sources yourself, or do your own searches if you disagree. Why do you assume he has some kind of bias just because you chose not to agree with what’s covered?Thank you. Searching on Magnesium and blood pressure I found that many people are recommending it as a safe supplement. Many of the plant foods we talk about everyday like leafy greens are rich in Magnesium are known to reduce blood pressure. Dr. Greger named Magnesium mineral of the year and has a video on it.Thank you Matthew. Unfortunately leafy greens (and I eat tons of them) and other magnesium rich foods have been becoming less and less rich in magnesium over the years, as the soil becomes depleted by chemical fertilizers, and overloaded with pesticides and more. Magnesium deficiency is becoming rampant in our society. And Magnesium oxide as a supplement is practically useless. Works mainly as a laxative. Mag citrate is also laxative in higher doses. I use Magnesium taurate and love it, and I take a lot of it daily. I also supplement with potassium. My particular health problems are miriad and I lose a lot of potassium despite eating tons of veggies, and my use of magnesium supplementation is for more than one reason as well but at least my BP is great! LOLI try to break up long series so there’s nothing but salt videos on the site for a whole month, or just apple videos or whatever. But don’t worry–I’ll mix in all the salt videos in the coming months. If you haven’t already, make sure you’re subscribed to my email newsletter to get announcements about future videos. Sorry to keep you waiting!Thanks for the information Doc. Well you have run several “series” of videos and that was what I had expected when you spoke of more NaCl/Sodium videos. That topic is far from “settled” in my mind, whereas most of the rest of my nutritional ideas are much better developed. I quite hate overfilling my inbox, and NF.O is one of my startup tabs, but I might “sign-on” for a bit just to see if I’m missing anything.I transitioned from a somewhat SAD to WFPB in March and couldn’t be happier with the observed results-which happen amazingly fast. I’m quite sure that I’m not going back and will be healthier and live longer because of such. Thank you and,Thanks again for the great public service you provide.Didn’t realize that the subscriber selected the frequency of contact. I can handle that.OMG! Dr. Greger! Do you have advice for vegan weightlifters or athletes? I can’t thank you enough.When discussing oils I wish there was more comparing better oils, if any, like coconut oil, for those of us without educational degrees to understand all this stuff. I know doctors like Dr. Esselstyn opposes all oil, but then healthy fats are recommended by many.Hi rob, in case you were not aware, Dr. Greger addresses coconut oil in many videos. (This is a very common question, which leads me to think the marketing of this stuff is just relentless…) If you click on ‘Health Topics’ and then ‘C’ and scroll down to ‘coconut oil’ you are likely to get some answers to your questions about coconut oil. Another benefit of using Health Topics is one gets to see lots of other topics on which one would have questions. Have a great day!So.. whats a guy to do to obtain the fat benefit of mixing turmeric with fat in the same meal? ground flax seeds would be enought? thanks!Hi Alexandre,Keep in mind that most diets, especially if you east whole plant foods are not completely devoid of fat. What might merit more investiagation, though, is how much fat is actually needed for increasing the bioavailability of fat soluble compounds like the curcumin in turmeric, vitamin D, and vitamin A as beta-carotene. This study, for instance, suggests that eating higher amounts of fat in dressings boosts cartenoid bioavailability from salads.http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/2/396.fullDr. Gregor also examines below how black pepper can boost turmeric’s bioavailability as well:http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/05/why-pepper-boosts-turmeric-blood-levels/Great info, as ever, but I wonder… if even olive oil is not that great anymore either, which are still good sources for us vegans to get some fat in our diet? I love nuts and avocado’s, but I suppose eating a handful a day of nuts and one avocado a day is not going to cover my dietary need for healthy fatty acids. Grateful for your advice!It’s incredibly hard to track down a reliable published source on your minimum required fat intake. I have seen studies going as low as 2.5% with no ill health effects (aside from the reported unhappiness of the study participants), and I have been quoted that even just 1% is sufficient by a Biochemist who specializes in human physiology, that’s only 20 calories a little over 2 grams of fat. The handful of nuts should be enough to meet your minimums and the avocado probably puts you over the top.And here studies that prove olive oil is good for our health, probably there are hundreds more. Who is telling truth then ? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26251666 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26192450 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26223368 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26168701 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26156740 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26148918Studies may suggest, show, indicate, but studies rarely “prove”. Also, nobody says that a study being published means the results actually indicate the conclusions the authors make… context helps. Dr. Greger’s video points out that olive oil isn’t actually beneficial… it is simply less bad than most regular alternatives. This is done by directly looking at the effect of giving someone olive oil, and looking at their endothelial function using an accurate test. Do any of your papers challenge that position? I think not, but lets check: Study #1 … Cardio-metabolic and immunological impacts of extra virgin olive oil consumption in overweight and obese older adults: a randomized controlled trial. Here, obese people on bad diets replace some of their fat intake with olive oil… and do better. This does not challenge the “olive oil is less bad” premise. They compared Olive oil to something worse, not something better (like walnuts).Study #2 Shows olive oil is less bad than Corn oil (a predominantly omega 6 oil… IIRC) in health subjects. Study #3 shows exclusive olive oil is ‘less bad’ vs normal diet (of worse oils) Study #4 is in rats, which is worth noting in that it might not translate to humans… and still shows the ‘less bad effect’ vs normal rat chow. Study #5 People who used olive oil vs other oils had slightly better outcomes… still consistent with a “less bad” effect. Study #6 Virgin olive oil is better than other oils compared.So nobody here seems to be lying per se… but Dr. Greger’s evidence here shows that if you are better with olive oil than other oils, you are even better off with no oil at all.adamas, I think your exercise is a great demonstration of critical thinking that is necessary to evaluate all the “proven exhonerations” of fats and animal protein that we are presented with.Well, Guest, all your studies side stepped Dr Greger’s main thesis that the the *presence* of oil (including olive oil (OO)) is deleterious to our arteries. Nearly every abstract you offered looked at substituting OO for other oils and the rest added OO on top of oils already being ingested. NONE of the studies looked at comparing the use of oil to the avoidance of oil.Furthermore, you muddied the waters bringing up anecdotal scenarios about animals eating fats in the wild. True, that does happen but the focus of the doc’s article was on the impact of olive oil in humans. I saw nothing in what you offered that addressed Dr Greger’s main point.Exactly. But studies can only suggest things, not prove anything, and it is always the TOTAL nutrition picture of the individual that has to be looked at. Dr. Gregor does the same thing all the other one-size-diet-fits-all/the-diet-I-believe-in-is-best-for-everyone-diet gurus/fanatics do. He cherry picks the studies, does NOT dig deeper, and proselytizes to death.Thanks, Linda. You have said that in an earlier comment. Please note Dr. Greger and I do not think “one-diet-fits-all”, in fact, we do not recommend any particular diet here over another. One comment you made was that “plant-based does not mean plants-only”. I agree, and anyone is free to choose to eat however they feel is right for them. You may like this video on flexitarian diets, as Dr. Greger mentions the benefits of a “flexible plant-based diet.” I do appreciate your thoughts and opinions.Best in Health! JosephThank you Joseph. I will take a look at the link you provided.Let me rewrite the abstract of just the first paper into real terms.Cardio-metabolic and immunological impacts of extra virgin olive oil consumption in overweight and obese older adults: a randomized controlled trial, Rozati, et. al.Background: We know we can no longer deny that excess fat hurts the immune system and will make you sick no matter how much we would like to do so. What we don’t know is how bad the health impacts of olive oil is compared to other types of fat in older people who are already obese and in ill health. So we are going to find out.Objective: We replace the unhealthy amounts of fat eaten by small group of sick older Americans with unhealthy amounts of olive oil to see if it makes them sick at a rate faster or slower than the fats they are currently overeating.Methods: We did a lot of scientificy sounding things (random, single-blind [really they couldn’t tell if it was corn oil or EVOO! Must be some pretty awful olive oil], placebo-controlled) to basically put a very small group of 65 sick people who have been eating a disease promoting diet for decades to the point it has destroyed their health into two groups. We gave both groups bottles of oil to take home and required that they consume the same unhealthy amount of fat for a period of time too short to really see much of a difference with such a trivial intervention while making sure they continued to eat all the other disease promoting foods common in the Standard American Diet. Then we measured a few things about their immune system to see if they got sicker, stayed about as sick as they were, or became slightly less sick. To do this we are going to focus on just a couple of measures of immune functioning. What we would never do is compare the results in context to healthy, non-obese older people to get a feel for where the results are on a more absolute spectrum. After all that wouldn’t be fully reductive.Results: The group eating too much olive oil didn’t get healthy. They weren’t able to go off their medications, they didn’t lose weight, their blood pressures and LDL didn’t get into the healthy range. But a couple of immune changes show to a small degree they were getting sick quite as fast as the other group. But actually most of the things immune functions we measured didn’t change, bummer. In fact we had to bring in a couple non-immune effects like insignificant changes in blood pressure and HDL in order to have something positive to say. This is not surprising because we had so little control over what these people actually ate and how they used the oil we gave them. We actually have no idea just how much olive oil they did eat and how much was disposed of after frying. In fact when we measured oleic acid content in the participants blood, the fat that in theory makes olive oil healthier, we found a very slight 2% increase on average with the range of -3.84% to +7.32%. So we don’t really know if these results are in fact due to the olive oil, but we are going to pretend they are because that is what we are getting paid to do.Conclusions: If you are going to insist on eat stupid amounts of fat as part of a high-fat, low-nutrient, low-fiber Standard American Diet, then at least use olive oil. Then you won’t get sick as fast, maybe.Acknowledgements: Thanks to the Deoleo Olive Oil company for paying for all of this.Conflicts of interest: The authors declare that they have no competing interests.I love the last twoWhat this study in no way says is whether adding olive oil to your diet would further improve or better maintain your health if you are already eating a very healthy diet high in whole plant foods and low in animal and processed foods.ROFL, Jim! You made my day!! What a fabulous job you did of rewriting how ridiculous even just this first paper was in terms of trying to tell real people what to eat to remain or get healthy.If many of the rest of the people commenting on this blog want to now give up healthy amounts of EVOO due to these studies and then proselytize and fear monger to every one they know how horrible EVOO is and how they better give it up or they are going to die, they are free to do so. But for these studies showed me no such thing and reasonable amounts of olive and other oils are staying right where they are in my plant-based but not plant only diet.Jim, your plain language stating the absurdities of the questions posed and standards used is superb here. I might actually pass along your rewrite to some friends who keep telling me that their fish, cheese, chicken and egg diets are ok because they use Olive oil a lot. Seriously man you do get to the heart of the crap methodologies that have been passed around forever.Like others, I am interested in whether problems arise with a 1/2 teaspoon per serving of EVOO or does the trouble start with 1/4 cup. I am not a fan of dry, water or broth sauteed onions or garlic, so I use a teaspoon (or less) of EVOO for four servings.I mean, I know broccoli is healthy, but perhaps ten pounds per meal would be less so. Likewise, a cup of EVOO might be deleterious but perhaps a little bit is not such a bad thing when coupled with lots of vegetables in a lentil stew.Then again, perhaps I’m just looking for absolution or a loophole to justify my current (and likely future) cooking habits…Picture you walk into an art gallery out of a bright sunny day and immediately look at the art. It will likely look dull and dim with little detail or interest. If you immediately just said that all that art is just crap and turned around and went back outside, you would never know that in fact the room is actually very well lit and that there are some very interesting images to be seen and enjoyed if you had just given your eyes even a few minutes to adjust. And in fact if you had stayed for a while, you might find the sunny day outside impossibly bright and might retreat back into the soothing light of the gallery.I’ve tried variations numerous times, but water, veggie broth or dry saute just don’t float my boat when it comes to garlic or onions.Happily enough, after reading remarks here from Jim Felder about the plant fats I’m ingesting anyway, and Joseph Gonzales about the relative number of calories, I’m realizing that it’s unnecessary to eliminate my intake of – at most – 1/2 teaspoon total per day of EVOO. At 120 cal per TBSP, 1/2 tsp. is 20 calories. Pfffttt… as my relatives would say, Ahh fuggedaboudit!Exactly. Everyone is up in arms but the thing is there is no perfect answer, and as Dr. Forrester always helps me remember, IT’S ALL RELATIVE! If you have a perfect LDL cholesterol and a prime body weight and you eat 10 servings+ of fruits and veggies, plenty of whole grain, and beans, and exercise daily, than 20 extra calories from a polyphenol-rich extra virgin olive oil is likely not going to wreak havoc on endothelial function. On the flip side, some folks cannot use “just a tad”, and others believe changing their taste buds to rid themselves from craving added fat is a good thing. Everyone is technically right. Another situation where I’d caution even a wince of oil is if endothelial function is already damaged and someone is at risk for heart disease and extremely overweight. Sure, even still, a 1/4 teaspoon may not do much, but why even eat it in the first place? I suppose the same argument could be made for the heathy person; why even expose myself to olive oil? And that is of course for all of is to decide.Loving the comments today on this complex topic! So many folks are engaged and posting more research. Thanks for your contributions.“When I’m on Earth I dream of Space, when I’m in Space I dream of Earth.” Scott Kelly @ 3:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30jRZe9Ss6MIts only human to want it both waysSure, if one’s endothelial function is already damaged, they should probably forgo the EVOO. They should probably largely forgo the nuts too at that stage, as they are likely to have the same effect, gram for gram of fat (albeit with some potential benefit absent from EVOO consumption). As you say, it’s all relative.Oh I agree with you. There is “perfect” and then there is so good it is hard to tell the difference. Even if you used a whole tablespoon of EVOO to sweat your onions and garlic and then make a 8-9 serving pot of chili with them, I think the impact on health would be very hard to see, even if you could distinguish it from background noise. The risk comes when the rest of a person’s diet also has a tablespoon of olive oil per serving in a salad dressing (because green leafys are super healthy but they need some kind of dressing) and then some canola oil in the cornbread to go along with the pot of chili (because oil-free cornbread is as dry as dust), and polish off the meal with some nice pan-fried apples (cooked with just a teaspoon of vegan margarine) with a very modest scoop of tasty vegan coconut milk ice cream for that whole apple pie ala mode comfort food finish. Then all the little bit here and little bit there add up to a whole lot of fat. And this all assumes you are cooking from scratch and not eating out or cooking with packaged food with their own whole oil slicks worth of added oil.So if it is really just the wee bit of EVOO to make those onions and garlic smell so good, then I can’t see the harm in healthy people. But if that is just the tip of the iceberg, then that can be a different story.Good points. I am personally very disciplined about oils and fats, but understand the dangerous slippery slope you described.Getting away from sugar? That, my friend, is a horse of an entirely different color.I’m in the first group. EVOO is the only added fat I consume. Actually, I occasionally use unsweetened desiccated coconut in curries, both for the flavour and the oil present. The EVOO not only tastes great itself, but distributes the flavour of aromatics throughout a dish in a way that simply can not be achieved without using oil. That said, much more of the fat I eat daily comes from nuts and other whole foods. I do tend to use a little more of it when training hard for a long distance wilderness hike or bike ride, but I am one of those that find it difficult to keep weight on, and in such circumstances I eat more of everything.The second group you describe is a different thing altogether. If it is just the tip of the iceberg, then a discussion about olive oil use is the wrong discussion to begin with.Does this mean that there’s no real problem with any fat (butter, etc.), just a need to eat good veggies with them?It means the anti-oxidant capacity of all those veggies is wasted mopping up for all that fat rather than being put to better use offsetting all the oxidative stress from other sources that can’t be so easily avoided.It means no such thing. It just means that nutrients 1) do not ever work alone, and 2) Balance is key.I use a small amount of EV olive oil when preparing my raw and cooked vegan meals. It significantly enhances the flavor and seems necessary for absorption of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). I do eat avocado, nuts, and seeds daily, but the rich taste of my marinara and the yum from my garlic bread comes from the olive oil. EVOO in small quantities seems relatively harmless, especially if it increases intake of veggies.I ask again – if I eat SFA, MUFA, PUFA and my EndoPat score was 3.56 – how is my diet injuring my endothelium??The EndoPAT score from the Itamar device looks to be measuring current endothelium functionality. Basically it looks like it gives you an idea of how much of your endothelium do you have left. It does not measure, as far as I could determine, how your endothelium responds to insults like a high fat meal, especially one that isn’t also accompanied by significant amounts of anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds as mentioned in this video. The brachial artery test does measure this directly by measuring the rebound rate of the arterial diameter after a secondary stressor, in this case reduction in blood flow from a blood pressure cuff. It is simple observed fact that the rebound rate is suppressed compared to baseline after a single high fat meal. It doesn’t get more black and white than that. The type of fat doesn’t seem to matter much. Over time that additional stress causes endothelial cells to die at a rate faster than they can be replaced by endothelial progenitor cells and so your endothelial functioning drops. So if the EndoPAT score is a true measure of endothelial functionality, you will see the effect of a high fat diet, not in a single score, but in the trajectory of scores over time as the endothelial lining of your arteries is eroded away. Of course if you wait the years until your score has dropped to know for certain that your high fat diet is causing you harm, your proof might come in the form of dropping over dead from a heart attack.SO – if I consume a highj fat meal containing whole milk kefir, avocado, nuts, seeds, etc. AND include things like pomogranate seeds, blueberries, cherries then exactly how much damage is being done?For example – in this study http://www.indiana.edu/~k562/articles/athero/postprandial%20oxidation%20tushuizen%202006.pdf Two consecutive high-fat meals affect endothelial-dependent vasodilation, oxidative stress and cellular microparticles in healthy men“Test meals At the meal visit, each subject received two standardized fatrich mixed-meals at breakfast (08:30 hours) and lunch-time (12:30 hours). Each meal consisted of 50 g of fat, of which 60% was saturated, 55 g of carbohydrates and 30 g of protein. The breakfast consisted of an EggMcMuffin (McDonald’s, affiliation Amsterdam-Sloten, the Netherlands), croissant with butter and marmalade, 200 mL of milk, combined with 20 mL of cream. The lunch consisted of Quarterpounder (McDonald’s), croissant with butter, and 200 mL of milk. The subjects were instructed to consume each meal within 15 min.”Now – this is CRAP that I DO NOT EVER EAT. How revelant is this study compared to someone who eats a whole foods non-processed diet?This study http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/25/2/406.full.pdf Acute Effect of High-Fat Meal on Endothelial Function in Moderately Dyslipidemic Subjects“In all subjects, the protocol was repeated on the same day, 6 hours after they had consumed an OFL consisting of 680 kcal/m2 of body surface with 83% fat, 5% proteins, 12% carbohydrates, and 600 mg cholesterol over a 20- minute time interval.”Again – how revelant is this? What percentage eat a meal like this?http://jn.nutrition.org/content/137/4/935.fullA High-Fat Meal Increases Cardiovascular Reactivity to Psychological Stress in Healthy Young Adults“The high-fat meal consisted of a McDonald’s breakfast: 2 hash brown patties, a Sausage McMuffin and an Egg McMuffin [820 kcal (3433 kJ), 42 g of fat, 17 g of saturated fat, and 270 mg of cholesterol]. The isocaloric low-fat meal consisted of Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes, skim milk, Source fat-free yogurt, a Kellogg’s Fruit Loops fruit bar, and Sunny Delight orange juice [830 kcal (3475 kJ), 1g of fat and 15 mg of cholesterol]. The low-fat meal included a 1000 mg sodium supplement to balance sodium intake between the 2 meals.”Again – these test meals are PURE CRAP and I NEVER eat these foods.Charles, my guess is that you are doing more damage to your endothelium if you eat a high percentage of calories as fat plus high anti-oxidant foods than if you ate a low percentage of calories from fat and the same amount of high anti-oxidant foods.As for the original brachial artery test where they fed the research subjects crappy McDonalds, this is just one study. This study has been replicated numerous times with other foods as well as just pure fat. Here is one where they just injected the fat straight into their veins. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3006255/. The results are the same. The degree of flow-mediated dilation as measured by the brachial artery test follows a dose dependent response to the amount of lipids introduced into the blood stream. It really doesn’t appear to matter how the fat gets into the body. It sounds like impairment of endothelial function really just depends on how much fat is in the blood.The amount of anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory containing foods consumed with the fat looks like it have a mediating effect on endothelial stress. So if you are going to eat a lot of fat, then try to eat a lot of anti-oxidant foods along with it to mitigate the damage. My best guess for endothelial health, keep the total fat down and anti-oxidants high.Injecting fat straight into the vein to study the effects of a high fat diet is ludicrous at it’s core. The human body was not meant to have fat injected straight into the vein. Fats were meant to be digested using the digestive system with fat digesting enzymes and all the other components of the complete digestive system.Once again this shows how ludicrous most of these reductionist nutrition studies are. I agree with Charles.Linda many people on this site prefer to eat whole foods. There is nothing wrong with that. And there is nothing magical about adding oil to foods. If it is something you prefer that is fine but you seem a bit irritated. Dr. Greger has convinced many of us that whole foods are the best way to go most of the time. So yes I may decide to sauté in oil at a meal just as I might choose to eat some coconut ice cream. But making it an everyday occurrence is probably not wise for those with CVD or a family history of CVD.Your reply has absolutely nothing to do with my post. I am a nutritionist who also eats whole foods. Definitions of this obviously vary. But back to the point: No matter what one’s nutritional views, injecting fat straight into the vein to study its effects is far removed from any definition of a whole foods diet as fats were meant to be digested using the digestive system, not injected into the vein!I suppose I was reading all your posts from this video and wondering what offends you so. I am not sure you read the articles. You are very passionate about your statements and you equate this site to paleo sites. As a “nutritionist” are you comfortable recommending oil specifically to your clients with heart disease? For those who have heart disease would you recommend as Dr. Esselstyn and others do keeping your fat at or below 10%? Many people were drawn to this site because they have some health issue and would like to try and heal themselves through diet if possible. I am sure that makes sense to you.I too got into nutrition to heal myself, and thus decided to then formally study it. I probably would not be alive today if I had not gotten into applying and then studying clinical nutrition and functional medicine.I am not offended, but, yes I do see marked similarities between this site, and paleo sites, as well as raw foodie sites and other such exclusive diet site. Do you not think those who took the paleo route wanted to heal themselves as well? Of course they did. And many did reverse diabetes and other illnesses just like many on this site have. No one diet is right for everyone because of biochemical individuality.But along those same lines, the followers of those diets are just as dogmatic in their beliefs as those on this vegan site. Most of those followers would not touch a grain or starchy carbohydrate if they were starving on deserted island. Sad. But, from where I sit, such a view is just as dogmatic as many vegans on this site who think meat or oil is just as much a consummate evil.I have heard followers of veganism on this site claim that paleo followers of the paleo dietary are “addicted to their meat”. Well if you’ve ever been at a paleo blog they claim all of you are addicted to your carbs! LOL!It is the dogmatism on all sides to which I object. Neither side is willing to look at any of the research the other side has to offer. And one can find studies on both and all sides of the issue to support whatever view one believes. Ever heard a raw food enthusiast rail against the evils of cooked food? I have. And I eat raw food as part of my own diet, but I also eat cooked food as well.I repeat: A study that actually injects fat into the blood stream is not a realistic study of how and how much fat affects the vascular system. Food fat was never meant to be injected directly into the blood stream. Fat was meant to be eaten (regardless of whether one believes that added fat should be part of a meal or not). It was meant to be digested into fatty acids first.And how about the part that has the participants eat 6 pieces of bread (presumably SAD type garbage wheat bread with HFCS and other nasties in it) to down the oil they are studying.These are ridiculously designed studies no matter on which side of the isle one sits when it comes to whether or not added fat in our diet is bad or good. My personal opinion on this is irrelevant.Calling this a “vegan” site because you eat animal products is a bit of a stretch. Dr Gregor and many others base their diet on the info from the latest science and studies, he recommends a WFPB diet…the rest is YOUR interpretation.ROFL!!!So in your studies you should have learned how to critique a research article. Right? There are 17 research articles attached to this video. Are you saying you critiqued all of these articles and decided Dr. Greger cherry picked? Ridiculously designed studies? All of them? Linda many of the people on this site have a formal science education so would be able to determine if a article is bad. If you are going to make comments like that you should site the tile and give us a bit of a critique. Otherwise it is a bit hard to read your comments without suspicion. Didn’t you once say something about a total cholesterol of below 150 being ridiculous? (maybe is was someone else) Just saying……Also it would be interesting for you to post articles when you make a comment. So for example if you say consuming animal is healthy then you should post a research article that we can critique and substantiates your claim.Spot on. Challenge the evidence and cite your own, not spouting opinions.Vegan Runner, Do you have your own website by any chance? I think I have just subscribed to it. Looks very good.One last question. You didn’t respond to my inquiry about your recommendations to your clients with heart disease.From the study“After two fasting baseline blood samples were drawn, subjects received, in random order, on separate days, either an 8-h infusion of 1) normal saline at 40 ml/h, 2) 20% intralipid at 20 ml/h (32 g of fat, low iv fat), 3) 20% intralipid at 40 ml/h (64 g of fat, high iv fat), or oral fat load with either 4) 32 (low oral fat) or 5) 64 g of fat (high oral fat). The 20% intralipid solution is a long-chain triglyceride emulsion composed of 50% polyunsaturated fatty acids, 26% monounsaturated fatty acids, and 19% saturated fatty acids. During the intralipid and normal saline infusion studies, subjects remained fasting. For the low (32 g fat/8 h) and high (64 g fat/8 h, or ∼100% daily fat value based on 2,000-calorie diet) oral fat load studies, participants received fat with FFA composed of 33% polyunsaturated fatty acids, 34% monounsaturated fatty acids, and 22% saturated fatty acids. The oral fat load in either low or high dose was given in four equally divided doses at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h.”This is RIDICULOUS. What does this have to do with reality?? My meals consist of fats, protein, carbohydrates, fiber, etc. Is this really the best you can do?http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170142/ ACUTE EFFECT OF A SINGLE HIGH-FAT MEAL ON FOREARM BLOOD FLOW, BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE IN HEALTHY MALE ASIANS AND CAUSASIANS: A PILOT STUDY“Test meals Isocaloric LF and HF meals (726 kcal) were given to the subjects at the study site in the morning after an overnight fast. The HF meal (50.1 g fat, 14 g saturated fat, 443 mg cholesterol, 22.3 g protein, 43.8 g carbohydrates) consisted of two eggs, hash browns with cheddar cheese, dry toast, margarine, and tomato ketchup. The isocaloric LF meal (5.1 g fat, 1 g saturated fat, 0 mg cholesterol, 31.3 g protein, 135.8 g carbohydrates) consisted of buttermilk pancakes, cherry topping, egg substitute, tomato ketchup, and commercial fruit juice. To assure consistency across subjects, meals were ordered from the same commercial restaurant.”OOH – the isocaloric lf MEAL IS soooo – it’s CRAP.Again – I don’t eat this garbage.Let’s assume olive oil is not that bad for a moment.Still, buying a quality product is very difficult. Despite what’s advertised 99% brands of extra virgin, cold pressed olive oil are you find in groceries are terrible products. I remember this scandal in Spain where they discover a specific brand was adding other oils into their bottles. Do I wanna spend 40$ for 500ml of liquid fat ? no thanks.You’re right about the quality, or lack thereof, of many olive oils in the market. A few years ago, many of the top selling brands in Australia were tested. Around half of the EVOOs did not meet the international standard, and a greater proportion did not meet the more stringent Australian standard. Some were partially adulterated with horrible products. Fortunately, it is straight forward for Australians to get hold of good quality EVOO, but it takes a bit of research.Here is a link to an article – ‘Inside the murky world of olive oil’ – from a major Australian newspaper on the issue if you are interested:http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/food-wine/inside-the-murky-world-of-olive-oil/story-e6frg8jo-1226285249264What about absorption of micronutrients in salads? Has anyone studied the oil in avocados and whole olives?I make a salad dressing with flax-seed in it to improve absorption of carotenoids. It also has ginger, garlic, mustard, dates, cumin, lemon and tomato paste in it.Thank you.Or you could put some dry toasted sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, slivered almonds on your salad and get a little fat to help with absorption. But do not the amount of fat required is very small on the order of 6 grams (http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/20040727/fat-helps-vegetables-go-down). That is the amount of fat in just 12 grams or about 2 teaspoons of sunflower seeds. So just a few nuts or seeds on your salad and you get the fat you need plus all the other nutrients besides just the fat, while OO or other oils just adds calories. What seals the deal for me is that nuts and seeds taste better than liquid oil to me, so I get even more flavor in my salads.My favorite dressing is just a couple tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, one to two teaspoons of Dijon mustard, a 1/2 teaspoon of maple syrup and maybe a little water wisked together as needed. Huge flavor, no oil and next to no added calories. Lets me eat mixing bowl sized salads with huge amount of nutrients without busting my calorie budget.Thank you.You aren’t getting anywhere near your calorie budget the way you eat, you fucking nut job.Or maybe you’re one of these old farts who sits around all day dicking around with food while you sit on the internet writing your crackpot theories because you have nothing interesting going on in your life.Am I wrong? (nope).Salad didn’t fuel civilization, you fucking reject.Like many others it seems, I too wonder about some of the real world interpretations of this information. I happen to eat a no added-oils vegan diet. I quite enjoy it and the results and have no interest in adding a bunch of oil to my diet, but – I wish sometimes we could see studies that instead of using e.g. 6 slices of bread and 1/4 cup of oil, used something a little more realistic.For example, if I were to make a giant batch of vegan chili (~8 servings), and used a tbsp of oil in sauteeing the veggies vs water sauteeing the veggies, if a person were to eat a single serving of that big bowl of beans and veggies either with or without the 1/8 tbsp of oil, does that result in a significant measurable difference?Personally I find it hard to believe it would, even as much as I generally extol the benefits of low fat plant based diet and follow it myself. I certainly have no desire to add any unnecessary processed foods (ie oils) to my diet and don’t really care either way, but I do wonder about it sometimes. Particularly in the context of advocacy. If someone’s trying to rein in their heart disease, diabetes, weight, etc, it’s a no-brainer to minimize the fat, but if someone otherwise appears to be in perfect health, does it matter? Dr. Esselstyn says that as long as someone’s cholesterol is under 150, nuts/seeds/avocado are fine in his opinion. He’s obviously the “NO OIL” guy, but what would he say if someone ate an otherwise WFPB diet, with small amounts of oil as I describe above, and still had a cholesterol < 150? Or is that considered impossible? Anyone have personal experiences/numbers to share? Or would he still say that even with levels <150, damage is still occurring and the oils should still be avoided?I think Esselstyn was committed to a good experimental design with the specific goal of stopping or even reversing CHD. In order to achieve that end he had to go staunch. Boomer, it is your life. Your risk. We choose not to sit in the closet with the lights out. There is no way to eliminate all the risk. The point is we at least deserve the straight dope about what the risk is. We now know that Oil is proportional to harm. Now does hormesis come into the picture at some low level? I dont think we know that yet. Darryl can tell us probablyI think Esselstyn was committed to a good experimental design with the specific goal of stopping or even reversing CHD.Right, and that’s part of the issue I was getting at. I don’t have heart disease, excess weight, etc. Every health parameter I’ve had tested is perfect (or typically “lower” than perfect). My cholesterol is < 150. So if tomorrow I started eating 1/4 tsp of oil per day on top of the rest of my diet – literally pounds of veggies, whole grains, beans, and fruit – that would be putting my life at risk? That would result in significantly different outcomes, ie heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, etc? Really?Now if I added oil to my diet, and gained weight, cholesterol went up, etc, then that would make sense to remove it. And if it didn't have any of the anticipated negative effects? Well then we're engaging in fear mongering, not scientific advocacy to still be labeling it as ""fatal if consumed in any amount"". To be clear, I'm not saying it would or it wouldn't have those effects. I'm saying, ""Would it?"", specifically, at levels much lower than what have been tested.We now know that Oil is proportional to harm.That’s kind of my whole point. 1/4 cup of oil is harmful? Of course it is. To then claim with certainty that 1/4 tsp is going to be significantly harmful? That is an unsupported assumption at this point. My point here is a matter of ‘limit of detection’, not ‘sensitivity’.The point is we at least deserve the straight dope about what the risk is.Agreed!I dont think we know that yet. Darryl can tell us probablyThis gave me a chuckle. Yes, Darryl can probably tell us. :)I don’t know, maybe it is just a USAmerican thing. This splitting of hairs. How many decimal places do you require? You have the info. Make your decision.Maybe I should put it this way. You know that old saw, “the poison is in the dose.” There are atoms of lead in that oil. There are atoms of Arsenic in your flax. Don’t you see? You’ve got to decide if eating a little oil is worth the risk. A single molecule of oil is like an atom of 238U.Remember that Imp, Mxyziptyl (sic)? Superman had to get him to say his name backwards to send him safely back to his dimension. Isn’t it like that with your dilemma? Perhaps if you say Lio when you add the oil it will make it safe to eat?I really don’t understand this incessant search for loopholes. To me, the question we should ask is related to hormesis. Not the disgusting potted meat-like product from Hormel…rather the principle introduced to me here some years ago by Darryl, that a small amount of “irritant” activates our natural defenses against harm. to wit, alcohol’s “J-curve”. Now that WOULD be worth teasing out.In my experience and opinion, hormesis is in some ways a sciency way of special pleading for a hypothesis that one is engaging in a bad habit at the optimal level. Yes, hypotheses of hormetic mechanisms and j-curves exist and should be considered, but we need strong empirical evidence to actually give them tooth. There’s also some generally slipperiness in the hormetic idea when it isn’t extremely certain of the exact mechanisms by which a hormetic benefit comes about. It may be that there are several interventions that can be shown to be beneficial on average at just the right amount in general populations, but it doesn’t follow that this describes correct dosage when applying all these interventions at once in someone pursuing a diet that is already known to modulate the burden of many chronic diseases.When he first mentioned it i was so skeptical i asked him, “Is your other brother named Darryl?” I usually end up regretting snark.What you say, Largelytrue, is largely true, but how does it help us?Doesn’t it help to reflect on the types of evidence that are likely needed to support a particular class of hypotheses?Again, hormesis as it is usually discussed is a tricky concept since it is talking about a tiny band of exposure at which the effect bucks a global trend of toxicity. Given any body of evidence, there is always going to be some hormetic hypothesis that isn’t excluded, therefore we must be especially careful to test hormetic claims in a way that exposes them to other forms of falsification that evade special pleading for a substantially positive effect at sufficiently low exposure. Then once you have a window of benefit in one controlled situation, you have to be very careful in extrapolating that window to other situations; we require a lot of good evidence not just to confirm the hypothesis that hormesis exists, but to make very reliable predictions about where the hormetic region lies in various situations. Practically by definition, you are likely to wind up paying money to give yourself a substantially harmful exposure if you mess up your estimates by even a moderate amount.The biggest point that I was aiming at is that hormesis can always be hiding under a rock somewhere, so it isn’t impressive that we simply “don’t know” yet whether there is a hormetic region for dietary fat on FMD. The idea-in-general is simply unfalsifiable, and this is precisely why we should be cautious about giving the hormetic idea any weight in guiding our actions. In guiding our efforts to expand our knowledge, yes, it certainly should be part of our toolkit for crafting hypotheses about possible threshold effects. But to take it seriously in practical decisions, we need a lot more specificity than you might otherwise think.Well! I’m no Darryl but if I was I’d say Harrumph!LT, I really brought up hormesis to give Boomer an out of what I thought was a very short sighted comment. i don’t care heaps about it.Still, dont you find the notion that we might learn to turn on our naturally occurring protective mechanisms…like superoxide dismutases and such…isnt there any intellectual pull in that direction by following up on hometic hypotheses? What if we learned to lift that minor effect into a life-extending application? Now that would be science in action.I said that hormetic hypotheses are important in research. They are in fact about as important as dyshormetic mechanisms and any other nonlinearity or threshold effect within the range of reasonably possible exposure. But my point is that as end-users of science, we shouldn’t rush to give credibility to these possibilities for which a model is not yet well-established, which is kind of what you were doing when giving special attention to the idea that it hasn’t been proven that there isn’t a hormetic regime for the consumption of fat on FMD.As a scientific idea the existence of some hormesis somewhere is unfalsifiable, so the main reason to fixate on it seemed to me to be related to ideas of actual practice in an environment of uncertainty, rather than the effort to conduct research per se. This site is in the first place more a gathering of lay practitioners than of rigorous researchers.aw come on. i dont want to win agains you. you said it was untestable…What do you want? I think a loophole is a false, accidental gap in the rules that allows someone to do something bad. If you want think that I think hormesis is a loophole ok , point to you. game set match to LT. Just for that I’m going to drink a whole bottle of Brent light ‘n sweet and its all your fault.I said that the generic idea that there is some sort of hormesis there is untestable. However, specific hypothesis about specific dose-response curves, are.In my first comment I was observing that in my experience that this line of thinking is often invoked to justify moderate vices. Because people are often primed to accept this sort of thinking on thinner evidence than usual, we should be a little more cautious about the arguments we see. You agree, I think, while I probably stumbled in trying to clarify the meaning of my first comment.Your general commentary is not really wrong. I wonder if we may be talking somewhat at cross purposes, given the context in which you seem a bit on edge in the conversation with b00mer as well, and the feeling that I have not responded accurately to your critique. If in this way I have helped to foul your mood, I’m sorry.No no, i’m happy really. I try to be outrageous to bring attention to the subject and make a point. But it becomes tiresome, this sorting out of priorities. I know my family is reading this and I try to hide my ID so I can point to it later and say see, others agree with me….jigs up init?You might be misinterpreting my concern, I’m not splitting hairs in trying to decide if I personally want to eat oil. I don’t eat it on a daily basis and I have no desire to. This isn’t some desperate quest of mine to justify eating oil and I’m not looking for any “loopholes”. I’m perfectly happy with no oil! I’m merely questioning why no researchers are addressing a very obvious and pertinent follow up question to the studies that have been done with rather unrealistic amounts.You find out something is harmful, that’s step one. Then you find out dosage/exposure/route of administration/chronic/acute etc. Lots of things are “toxic” in some amount, but that’s only the beginning. Uranium-238 is naturally occurring. Should we hide from all rocks and dirt to avoid all possible exposure? Of course not. Because we know the practical parameters for legitimate toxicity. This is just a simple matter of curiosity about the world. I’m merely musing about what the answer is to a question we don’t have the answer for. Neither of us consume oil. If you’re not curious what the threshold level is for health damaging effects, that’s fine, but I am.When I first heard about oil-free eating it was a curiosity to me. I tried it almost on a whim and never went back. It was effortless since aside from oil I was already whole foods plant based. But I know others are different, some people do really love their oil, and hey, if there’s some small amount that does appear to be safe for those who don’t have any immediate danger from CVD, it might be a significant factor in getting them to try a plant based diet, which if started early enough, might in itself give them the leg up on preventing all sorts of diseases.So partially my concern is in regards to effective advocacy, but also frankly it is just a huge, obvious, mathematical gap in the research that regardless of the particular subject matter is just begging to be filled in. I can’t believe such an obvious question hasn’t been addressed.Perhaps if you say Lio when you add the oil it will make it safe to eat?I got a really big kick out of this :) Too funny.b00mer: I think you have a very good point.My take on it is: I treat oil the same way I treat sugar. I have some of both in my diet, but I try to limit them and I don’t kid myself that either one is a health food. Small amounts may not hurt my health, but it is too easy to consume more than small amounts as a little here and a little there really add up. So, I try to be careful with how much I consume.Now, if some people really need a hard number of how much is safe vs not safe because having a number will help them eat an otherwise whole plant food based diet, then I agree that some more research would be helpful for those people.I could not disagree more. Your trying to violate the laws of thermodynamics. Its about signal to noise ratio. Scientists have precious little money, at least the good ones it seems. My compatriot, Ernest Rutherford said “we didn’t have money so we had to think”So they pose a question…or rather a disprovable guess and then do what they can with what they have to disprove it. You can’t do that by collecting data that is polluted with noise. So they turn up the volumn and let rip.You want me to spend more on science to delve down into that noise? so you can know how many mg of oil you, individually can safely slather on…??? really, aren’t you a bit smarter than that? Yes you are.My contributions will be spent on good science to help the teeming masses overcome their societally engineered ignorance of good nutrition…your minutia can wait. Don’t get mad…i do like you more than most of the humans.Valter Kempner, channeling through RhomboWell, the devil is in the detail, so we’d better get around to them sooner rather than later. You make some good points about relevant scarcities, but your “I could not disagree more” seems rather extreme. Dose-response is not minutia. I agree with boomer’s desire for further and more realistic testing, but I understand why this has not happened.I personally do eat extra virgin olive oil. Not a quarter of a cup at a time, but some. Does it increase my risk of cardio vascular disease? Maybe. It makes up a very small part of my largely whole foods plant based diet, and on balance appears fairly neutral. What isn’t neutral is the utility I derive from consuming it. I love the stuff. I probably eat more healthily with it than without it. I also like to jump out of planes for fun – an activity with obvious inherent risk – so perhaps my attitude toward risk lays away from the average closer to one end of the spectrum.You can’t do that by collecting data that is polluted with noise. So they turn up the volumn and let rip.You want me to spend more on science to delve down into that noise?The idea that data at the low end is obfuscated by an unfavorable signal to noise ratio is conjecture on your part, and would have required some attempt at data collection at the low end to have determined that. Do you have some knowledge of these alleged failed experiments? If so, that would be very interesting to read about, but if not the whole point is that there is no data at the low end for you to base this statement on. We go from zero, to unrealistic and huge amounts. If data on minimal intake is attempted, and the data is of poor quality, then there is a decision to make as to whether it’s worth it to troubleshoot. If it turns out that it’s not the effort to continue, that’s fine, and if we get reliable data on the first try, that’s fine too.Regarding expense, if you’ve already wrangled up a bunch of volunteers to eat something and then measure arterial dilation, it isn’t going to bankrupt anyone to have them eat a couple different meals, take a couple more measurements to get some data points in between, and do the same analysis on all of them. Especially when doing so would render the study infinitely more meaningful in the context of real life for most people. We’re not talking about reinstituting the shuttle program here.I’m not sure why I’m spending so much time defending the idea of curiosity and knowledge over remaining determinedly ignorant on a topic. What does having another couple of data points hurt? Why is the idea of asking a simple question so threatening? I’m not sure why you are so determined to label me as an angry olive oil devotee in disguise. I explained clearly that I do not eat it and do not wish to. To continually insinuate that I’m lying and continue making condescending statements towards me is your choice, but that is generally not a productive mode of conversation.Darmok and Jalad on the Ocean!“Valter Kempner, channeling through Rhombo” AKA Coacervate/Gregor me thinks?ha ha ah I am so impressed Kate! those others are pikers… Even Elvis was in here during my operation! “This ain’t the heart-break hotel!” I tells him. Its a constant fight to suppress them….only listen to Rhombo!Don’t worry, your secret is safe with me.Watch out Kate, he’s a slippery extinct mythological sock puppet sea serpent.With the above studies, the shoddy way in which they were designed, in my humble opinion, we are still left in the dark. These studies do not give the straight dope! They are just as badly designed as most of the other reductionist nutrition studies out there.Oh my. So if you don’t think research has value then you put more credence on expert opinions? That will get you into trouble most of the time and is how medicine has been practiced for too long. I will put my faith in the overwhelming data that has been collected. I want to take advantage of the current best research available. Yes there are bad studies. And with time conclusions may change. That is the nature of what we are talking about.Good research and good studies are good research and good studies. Shoddy studies and shoddy research are shoddy studies and shoddy research. I’ll put my faith in the good stuff. Nough said.Cite them then! Or are you just trolling?W.r.t. your question, I’ve been eating a LF-WFPB diet for a little over 6 years. I use about 1 tbs of extra-virgin olive oil a day. On no meds, my TC is 128, LDL 65, TG 65, HDL 50. Dr. Esselstyn distinguishes his diet from his son’s Rip as Plant Perfect vs Plant Strong.Stated another way, dose matters. Simple sugars and salt are demonized. And high doses of both should be. But as McDougall often says, if adding sugar to oatmeal in the morning is going to get you to eat your oatmeal, add the sugar. Similar rules for salt. Jeff Novick has some good guidelines on salt.But, like I explained in my rather long comment about 30 minutes ago, olive oil intake is not going to show up negatively in your cholesterol numbers – its negative effect is more stealthy. Thus, be very careful about the “dose” of olive oil, just as you should be with sugar and salt.McDougall often says, if adding sugar to oatmeal in the morning is going to get you to eat your oatmeal, add the sugar.Fred, I actually had this exact quote in mind when I first commented here on this. Some people really like their oil. Personally I don’t, but I recognize some people are different. And if they would be so turned off by absolutely zero oil that they might not try a plant based diet at all if they felt that was a requisite component, or if they might decide ‘hey what’s the point in even trying’ and keep pouring huge amounts rather than using some smaller amount sparingly that was deemed relatively harmless, then I think that would be a shame.I did read your other response and I have always found that green monkey study very fascinating as well. And of course at the same time, I still have to wonder about the dose-response issue. If the monkeys were living a full lifetime of nothing but greens and fruits every day and added a fraction of a tsp of oil, would that make a difference over time? Maybe, maybe not. Knowing wouldn’t make any difference for me, I’m happy with no oil! But it may for others, and I think it’s a pertinent question. A study like that would obviously take some time, but in the meantime even some FMD data with more reasonable doses would be interesting to see. Oh and thanks for sharing your numbers and experience. Btw they look great! You’re clearly doing something right. :)Vitamin E is made from plant oils. There is a little bit of Vitamin E in Olive Oil. Could some of the health benefits perceived to be from olive oil from its Vitamin E content? For many millions of people, their only source of vitamin E is plant oils or multi vitamins. Almonds are one of the best sources of vitamin E. Do we have a vitamin E deficiency problem? Vitamin E has many heart benefits. Is the olive fruit, pre domestication, trying to help the hearts of a distributor? Possibly. Possibly there are some of those benefits in the olive oil, with more in the whole food.THANK YOU. I’m putting a star next to this one to show my friends who are hooked on their “healthy oils”. Looking at the comments below I see the classic signs of addiction. People look for loopholes when they feel threatened. That is a good sign. It means they are not able to live with the discord. Lets hope they CAN handle the truth. Eat WHOLE FOODS, not refined oils, sugar, starch.I think addiction is a massive overstatement for most who are commenting below. Preferring to use a bit of oil while cooking otherwise WFPB and trying to learn if some levels are an acceptable risk is hardly the same as Jonesing for a heroin fix.Actually I think you’re right. A little bit of heroin is OKWhew! Glad we agree on something! :)I’m not even sure if Rhombopterix watched the same video. We seem to have taken away different messages. Unfortunately, the response to fat from nuts (gram for gram of fat content) was not tested, and I strongly suspect it would be similar to EVOO (albeit without the other benefits).Nothing like jonesing for a heroin fix at all. I find some people’s all or nothing attitude to risk quite perplexing here. Do they all want to live in bubbles? “to show my friends who are hooked on their “healthy oils”. Maybe they are justifying something harmful by practicing self deception. Maybe they take the headlines in the newspapers as the final word. Maybe they really like oil and removing it from their diet is not worth it for them. I certainly wouldn’t remove it from my diet without much more and better evidence. The trade offs always seem to go unnoticed in these comment threads.Best comment of the day. We see this response when there is a suggestion about coconut oil too. People are funny that way!This is probably too much info, but people ARE funny. Whenever I would start running or anything like regular fitness, in my tobacco addicted, alcoholic family that was viewed as … i dont have the words…above my station or being phony. Can you imagine? No you cant! I’ve decided to stop hiding from health. Its just die-ing to get hold of me. People of Earth Attention: LIVE, find and be your real self.I like your name. = Run Vegan Runner. or Ride a bike or just do what makes you happy. choose your family carefully. Teach the children. Push |>Some people have odd opinions about exercise I agree! I have treated patients who think it is an absolute waste of time to train because it is all about the brain. I once read an interview one of my patients gave. I asked him why he called his strengthening program a stretching program. He responded that he was embarrassed for people to know he exercised! I told him people respected those who exercise. He then reported that he had since changed his description and calls it a strengthening program.I think I should have used WFPB-runner. Not as catchy?I would like to hear Dr. Greger’s oppinion on using vinegar as a food. It was mentioned at the end of the video and I am very curious about this.Predrag1970: Dr. Greger has a couple videos on vinegar: http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=vinegarThea, thanks for sharing the link. It is very strange that someone like Dr. Greger recommends rotten products for human consumtion. Vinegar is a product of bacterial fermentation and our food cannot digest in the presence of acid (other than or own HCL acid), whether it is starch or protrin we consume. Even a trace of acid with our meal is enough to completely arrest digestion and to destroy ptyaline as well as pepsin.(That is why fruits are recommended to be taken alone, as a separate meal, because it’s acid.) It will also arrest the flow of gastric acid, HCL, in which ONLY, our food can be digested. I am reffering to Dr. Herbert Shelton’s book Food combining made easy, where the rules of proper food combining are thoroughly explained.I can ask him if you’d like, but I can assure you he’ll point to his research articles already available here. Food combining or eating fruit alone may help some folks, but to my knowledge it’s all anecdotal evidence. Having a banana in your morning oatmeal seems to be completely tolerable and I never tell patients to eat fruit by itself. If I am missing some crucial research please let me know.Sure thing. We have a few videos on vinegar, also, here.Dr. Gonzales, with all respects, I watched the videos, but they are only saying about vinegar lowering one thing or another, they are not saying anything about acid arresting digestion, like in the Shelton’s book on food combining, or in traces in your famous Guyton, if my memory serves me well. Are you saying that the physiological rules of our organism’s proper functioning suddenly changed and that nowadays one can digest with the add of poisons like acetic acid? I eat only proper combined fruit for breakfast, and that means sweet fruits with sweet fruits and acid fruit with acid fruit, for more than 20 years now, and my three children since they stopped breast feeding, and this is far from anecdotal, if you don’t mind. My son is now 16 and my daughters 12 and 8 years old. Hence my question is not anecdotal but comes from a real life and my interest for physiology of digestion. Since you’ve mentioned it, one should also know that mixing sugars, like bananas with starches, like cereals will almost certainly result in fermentation in the stomach. I think your approach to this thing is more technical or mechanical in nature, counting calories and haphazardly gulping smoothies, and never spoke a word about proper food combining, although I heard Dr. Greger say that it’s not what you eat but what you digest, if I am not wrong. Hence my reaction.Predrag1970 the one thing to remember is that Dr. Greger will not make a statement unless it is backed up my a research article. I am not aware of any research articles on food combining but if you go to PubMed and search you will find out. You then can read the articles and determine if they make sense. But as Dr. Greger will tell you “he reads them so we don’t have to.” But oftentimes he will make a statement in a video and then I pull up the articles he referenced and see for myself. I then can understand where his statement is coming from.The idea that our bodies would be only capable of digesting certain types of food at a time strikes me as a good topic to sell books and not much else, just silly.Timing is essential. The perfect time for us humans to eat our food is when the food reach it’s full ripeness. After that, microorganisms will return the food to elementals. At that point the food starts to be theirs, microorganism’s, and it becomes poisonous to humans. It’s not ours anymore. Of course, the phenomenon of some human’s need or habit to eat unripe food or to eat pickles or vinegar or other rotten stuff, as well as to use alcohol and tobacco, could be explained to an intelligent person. The physiology of digestion is of essential importance and in your country once lived great men who spent their lives investigated this and left their heritage so we can EVOLVE, and it is most strange how modern medicine treats human digestive tract merely as a garbage can. Of course, with some vinegar added. I’m not selling any books neither. I’m curious to find out more precisely about Greger’s ideas.Yes, ripeness is certainly desirable, but consider that microorganisms will also naturally PRESERVE that ripe food and gift us with probiotics when we eat them, improving our digestion and utilization of the food we eat. Evolution will happen with or without men investigating digestion, as it has up to now. If we eat as we evolved to instead of as we are inclined, we would all be a lot healthier. The gut and microbiome are hugely more important than anyone ever guessed, and it’s study has applications that not only affect digestion, but our entire physiology.Joseph, since its what we digest or assimilate that is of great importance why can’t I find any videos on digestion. Wouldn’t this be just as important as all the minutia about toxic meat and dairy?Many videos mention digestion. “Digestion” is a complex process coupled with peristalsis and absorption. I think we have many videos that discuss this process.I would also be curious at the difference between the REAL fermented vinegar complete with it’s beneficial microbes, and processed, distilled, whatever, vinegar. I also find it really confusing when the term “pickled” can mean either lacto-fermented with live microbes, or just boiled in vinegar… not comparable in my book. A few reports here kind of negate fermentation of say kimchee or kombucha, but my experience has been overwhelmingly positive on many levels!Question… Does the results of the Brachial artery test show the same if a fatty veg or nut is eaten? I understand with the pure oil but what about the food they come from?? If I eat olives and walnuts and take the test will they stiffen up as well?I would so love if you can do some up dating on studies on the intake of avocado’s… most of what I find you have here on avocado is 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 years old… hope more research is out there & we can get more information on the whole avocado… thank you… :)This sounds like an interesting upcoming study with avocados:https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02479048It will measure postprandial endothelial function using FMD. (Although, we’re looking at a high fat meal with 1/2 avocado and a high fat meal with 1 avocado, vs a control meal that’s high in saturated fat combined with high amounts of carbohydrates eaten by overweight / obese adults.)There is an article in the April 2015 issue of The Life Extension magazine entitled “Olive Oil Offers Unique Cardiovascular Protection”. The article is a review of 36 liturature references. So What is the deal???I dunno. Got a link to the article?Just because a source uses references doesn’t mean its reasoning is good. This is especially true of popular sources. The calorie restriction movement has some ingrained cultural preferences for Zone-type diets, so it’s not exactly unexpected that they would praise oil.Look at the Life Extension website, http://www.lef.org. Look for the April 2015 issue of the magazine. Also someone posted links to nih website saying olive oil is good. So what about the antioxidants in EVOO. Maybe these studies used the fake stuff.So it looks like they have another moneyed bias toward promoting supplements of special nutrients. Focusing on hypotheses about special, unique health-promoting chemicals in olive oil with no alternative sources in other foods that may become a target for supplementation in the future is to some extent a win-win for them. Never mind that the results they seem to cite are for diets that are pretty poor in polyphenols and other plant foods generally (such as PREDIMED).But even if we suppose that special olive polyphenols are key to heart health on a whole food plant based diet, it does not follow that olive oil is a sharp way of introducing them. On a per-weight basis, olives generally appear to have 2-3 times the polyphenol content of extra virgin oil, which is quoted as having 550mg/kg: http://phenol-explorer.eu/reports/45Even in research on EVOO especially high in polyphenols, it doesn’t seem that levels get appreciably higher than 1500mg/kg: http://jn.nutrition.org/content/138/6/1074.full.pdfThus we know that on a per-calorie basis, olives are an even richer source. Which would you rather eat on health grounds: the approximately whole plant food or the extracted oil?A general idea that you may be missing is that it’s perfectly compatible for EVOO to be a complex package with both positive and negative effects on health. The fat may promote poor endothelial function, particularly with the abrupt absorption associated with its refined packaging, while the antioxidants may lead to metabolic changes that help free-living people who have acquired advanced disease (and who are therefore likely to be eating unhealthily). is entirely possible for the positive effects to be magnified in the sick and for the negative effects to be magnified in the healthy, so we shouldn’t immediately clamp down on the idea that EVOO is an important addition to a heart-healthy diet, with no superior alternatives.a dozen years ago it was red wine and before that it was milk and before that it was,,,i don’t know, champagne with radium. Now it is coconut oil…next it will be radium again.So don’t be so sure that what you hold to be very healthful now will be shown not to be so great in the future. Remember when Avocados were advised against here? Hibiscus tea unstrained was maybe a good way to consume it? Credit where credit is due, both of those opinions were updated when new evidence emerged. But it does serve as a reminder to moderate one’s confidence and remove certainty.http://www.lifeextension.com/Magazine/2015/4/Olive-Oil-Offers-Unique-Cardiovascular-Protection/Page-01 Olive Oil Offers Unique Cardiovascular Protection“Endothelial Function Another way olive oil exerts its beneficial cardiovascular effects is by improving endothelial function of arteries. Endothelial dysfunction, an early step on the path to coronary artery disease—and ultimately, heart attack and stroke—occurs when arteries are unable to perform in ways that help maintain healthy blood flow and normal blood pressure.17Endothelial dysfunction has not only been found in patients with coronary artery disease, but also in those with type II diabetes, hypertension, obesity, high cholesterol, and metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes).18,19In a 2013 double-blind clinical trial, US and Italian researchers found that consuming 30 mL (2 tablespoons) of polyphenol-rich olive oil daily for four months significantly improved endothelial function in adults with atherosclerosis.20Excitingly, olive oil improves endothelial function in as little as two hours after consumption.20 However, plant polyphenols don’t stick around in the blood very long, so the study authors proposed that ingredients in olive oil likely alter the expression of long-term endothelial modulators, such as nitric oxide synthase.20 Endothelial nitric oxide synthase is an enzyme that generates nitric oxide (NO).21 Nitric oxide is a protective molecule that signals arteries to expand so blood can flow through more easily, thus lowering blood pressure.22Even more encouraging is evidence that polyphenols in olive oil can interact with a hereditary gene variant of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (the NOS3 Glu298Asp polymorphism, which is a risk factor for hypertension and coronary artery disease), to improve endothelial function after meals.19 So, even if genetics are not in your favor, olive oil may help.”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3915409/ Beneficial effects of polyphenol-rich Olive Oil in patients with early atherosclerosishttp://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=199488Effect of a Mediterranean-Style Diet on Endothelial Dysfunction and Markers of Vascular Inflammation in the Metabolic SyndromeA Randomized TrialMain Outcome Measures Nutrient intake; endothelial function score as a measure of blood pressure and platelet aggregation response to L-arginine; lipid and glucose parameters; insulin sensitivity; and circulating levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukins 6 (IL-6), 7 (IL-7), and 18 (IL-18).Results After 2 years, patients following the Mediterranean-style diet consumed more foods rich in monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and fiber and had a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids. Total fruit, vegetable, and nuts intake (274 g/d), whole grain intake (103 g/d), and olive oil consumption (8 g/d) were also significantly higher in the intervention group (P<.001). The level of physical activity increased in both groups by approximately 60%, without difference between groups (P = .22). Mean (SD) body weight decreased more in patients in the intervention group (−4.0 [1.1] kg) than in those in the control group (−1.2 [0.6] kg) (P<.001). Compared with patients consuming the control diet, patients consuming the intervention diet had significantly reduced serum concentrations of hs-CRP (P = .01), IL-6 (P = .04), IL-7 (P= 0.4), and IL-18 (P = 0.3), as well as decreased insulin resistance (P<.001). Endothelial function score improved in the intervention group (mean [SD] change, +1.9 [0.6]; P<.001) but remained stable in the control group (+0.2 [0.2]; P = .33). At 2 years of follow-up, 40 patients in the intervention group still had features of the metabolic syndrome, compared with 78 patients in the control group (P<.001).Conclusion A Mediterranean-style diet might be effective in reducing the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its associated cardiovascular risk.does this include fish oil supplements?I am now beyond confused and starting to think that the only way we can be healthy is to eat raw vegetables. While I am ok with some of that, good luck with kids. Is the only healthy way to not eat raw to eat everything steamed? I do not see this happening any time soon.I am a huge fan of this site and everything that Dr. Greger teaches but heck, it starts to feel like we should just stop eating anything unless it is vegetables, fruits or nuts/seeds and, they are raw.This is close to impossible in today’s crazy busy life, and is impossible for people on a budget. So are we all destined for a heart attack and the operations that follow that? It seems wrong. I am sure there is a healthy balance we can achieve with a combination of an active lifestyle and eating as many healthy foods as makes sense. Am I wrong?What aspect of Greger’s video library even comes close to hard-core advocacy for raw foods, or wide-ranging claims about the evils of whole grains?Schalk: I can understand how it might feel that way, but that is not a good representation of Dr. Greger’s videos on this site. This site shows the virtues of whole grains, cooked (as well as raw) veggies, fruits, and nuts and seeds (plus a B12 supplement). Here are Dr. Greger’s overall nutrition recommendation. http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/I’m guessing that you are thinking that you have to use oil to cook your veggies and other foods. But you don’t! There are some great alternatives to using oil and food will still taste great. Your kids will still love it. Is that enough of a reply, or would you like me to provide specific examples and websites that provide guidance/examples which are in line with NutritionFacts?Ooops! I left out legumes (beans) from the list of food categories that are very healthy. There’s a ton of variety beyond raw veggies!I should also add that it may be difficult to get enough calories in children if you tried to feed them only raw veggies. A site called the Vegetarian Resource Group has some great advice for feeding kids in a healthy way.I should also address the part of your original post that talked about eating on a budget. There are a couple of great books that can help with that: Vegan on the Cheap (one of my favorite cookbooks) and Eat Vegan on $4 Per DayThe first book does include some oils in the recipes, but the oil is usually just for sauteing the onion and garlic, which as I mentioned is very easy to get around if you decide you want to cut back on your oils.Hope that helps.I agree that children can eat healthy plant based food and like it , being accustomed to it from say age 2 makes it easier.On the other-hand I saw children who would not touch a green bean with a 10 foot pole by the age of three. I don’t blame them either because they way the vegetables are presented (boiled until they are limp and tasteless) wouldn’t tempt me either.By the way ” Vegan made easy ” is a great recipe book too (e-book/kindle) , only about $10, not complicated and with recipes on condiments as well, helpful especially if going oil – free. The author’s first name is Anja if I remember correctly.vegank – Thanks for the additional resource. This kind of thing can be really helpful for people starting out.Thanks Thea, we tend to miss the texture of food most, so Anja’s recipe which includes oil-free condiments and easy vegan cheeses is really helpful. Her Flax seed crackers + Sunflower seed cream-cheese is my favorite . You can pick and choose the recipe you want to use and then try to get into WFPB approach more as you go. I found that there’s not only the animal protein craving to get over at first, but also the fast food mentality (fry a couple of steaks and we’re done-mentality). This is hard to do without a recipe especially when considering what to pack for lunch or what to have on the go.The author’s name is Anja Cass ( I remembered at last – I should be taking my B12 more regularly like Dr Greger told us to !), people can find her recipes and videos at http://www.cookingwithplants.com or on You Tube. Hope this helps.vegank: Nice post! I think you are so right that switching to whole plant food based diet is as much about getting over mental hurtles as anything else.I wanted to wait to reply to your post until I had a chance to check out your link. Great site!! (At least what I have seen so far.) Thanks for supplying that link. I’m definitely adding Anja’s website to my list of go-to places for ideas and referrals.Hi Thea, I’m glad you liked it, You don’t need very exotic and expensive ingredients with Anja’s recipes which is the great part. I like the fact that it does not take too long to make the dishes, eg the vegan fat-free Pizza. I tweak the recipes if the ingredients might affect my blood sugar , at least there is no need to reinvent the wheel. Going back to the making vegetables more child-friendly, I think the Raw-food people do a great job of making vegetables visually appealing (and tasty), as well as the way it’s cooked in Asian cuisine.I would just like to add to the above, that a WFPB diet is CHEAPER by FAR than a S.A.D. and so much simpler! No way I could afford that processed junk or meats and dairy! I grow a lot of my own veggies and get the rest from a farm market, my grains and seeds from a bulk store. On the rare occasions I have to go into a standard grocery store, my jaw drops when I see the high price of what is essentially chemical sludge on the shelves! My pet peeve is seeing people at the checkout with carts full of processed garbage, chips, cookies, soda, etc. and using food stamps! Food stamps are supposed to be for FOOD, no?Charzie: I understand your pet peeve and share it. But I don’t really blame the people buying the food. I blame the system we have in place that keeps those people in ignorance and often unable to focus on the healthier foods. (For example, not all farm markets will accept food stamps I don’t think…) I think all we can do is be role models and support efforts like NutritionFacts which are trying hard to set things right.By the way, I thought your post is well worded. I got a kick reading it. Thanks.I agree Thea, it absolutely is the twisted and corrupt system at the root of the problem.Yes the prices are part of the reasons why healthy eating is not easy for all. I’ve started in the last two years to add home grown vegetables too, went through a learning curb with the timing for sowing etc but finally getting into a cycle of planting and harvesting this year. I am also looking forward to pre-ordering Dr Greger’s new book. (I am having technical difficulties with Discuss today) VegankExamples would be great, thanks Thea.Happily! Here’s my take: Many, many, many recipes that I see for mostly Whole Food Plant Based (WFPB) eating which happen to include some oil usually have oil just for sauteing the onions, garlic and/or mushrooms. There are two ways to get around using oil in these circumstances and the recipe will still come out great. (I can’t tell the difference once the whole recipe is put together.)One way is to use a technique called a water saute. The idea is to use a tiny bit of water to prevent sticking, but not enough water to actually steam the food you are cooking. I don’t have a specific resource showing how to use this technique, because I use the second technique myself. But lots of people have success with water sauteing and you can find descriptions and probably videos on line.The second method is to use the microwave. I have had wonderful success getting mushrooms and onions perfect with a few minutes of microwaving. Just put the chopped up food in the microwave without any oil or water. If the onions come out tasteless, you cooked them too long. They should be translucent, but still sweet and flavorful. The benefit of the microwave is that it requires no skill and no time standing over an oven. I’ve never burnt nor had to scrub a pan with this method.Rami pointed out that Forks Over Knives has a page on how to cook without oil. I don’t have that link at my fingertips, but hopefully you could find the page. You might also want to spend some time checking out the Forks Over Knives website. They have 275 recipes, all oil free. An example title/recipe: Sweet Potato Lasagna. Now that’s not just rabbit food!Or pick up a cookbook that is oil-free for more ideas. In addition to the Forks Over Knives cookbook, you might check out the book Better Than Vegan. Or Chef AJ’s book Unprocessed. I don’t think any of McDougall’s books use oil.Also, some bloggers focus on oil recipes. The blogger Fat Free Vegan does not use oil in her/his recipes and I believe she/he caters to a family including young kids. So, you know the food has to pass some pretty high standards. http://fatfreevegan.com/But really, as I said above, you don’t have to limit yourself to recipes that don’t have oil in them. I find that the vast majority of the time, whatever recipe that interests me will taste great simply leaving out the oil. I even managed to replace 1/2 cup of oil with water in a sauce and then did a taste test with a group of people. They thought the sauce was wonderful and didn’t miss the oil at all. The sauce had plenty of other rich ingredients, including nut butter, so that the oil wasn’t needed.If you have kids, I think it is helpful to check out the website called Vegetarian Resource Group (VRG). They based their advice on some good research and have some pages specifically about feeding vegan kids: http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/kids.php http://www.vrg.org/family/kidsindex.htm The above pages do not talk about going oil-free per say. But they help you to make sure you avoid the mistakes that might be made when trying to feed kids a healthy diet.I don’t know where your family is on your diet journey, but I suspect that if you have already made the jump to being free of meat, dairy and eggs, it should be a pretty easy adjustment to wean yourselves of the oil.Truth in advertising: I use some oil myself. But not for everyday cooking. I tread oil like sugar. Good for occasional desserts or rare holiday meals. I do use it. But I don’t kid myself that it is healthy. When I eat healthy, I enjoy a wide variety of food (even cheap food most of the time) and simply don’t need the oil.Hope that helps!I agree with Thea. And note the video is not saying no oil no way no how! To me it’s saying if you use it, maybe cut down a bit if you have heart trouble, which of course many people have. Also, olive oil is not all cracked up to be some amazing health food. There are some polyphenols in EVOO so I think if you’re using it shoot for EVOO. Kids are different and depending on their overall diet may benefit from some EVOO. Of course an active lifestyle is great, and loading up on veggies may counter any negative effects, so really we have a lot of solid information now that we can put into practice! Let me know if you want other resources on kid’s health?Best, JosephWhen I first began my vegan diet, I was still experiencing angina. A cardiologist wanted to implant stints or perform quadruple bi-pass surgery saying two of my heart arteries were blocked. I said, “I’ll think about it.” Meanwhile, a friend who’s a Dr. of Nutrition suggested I stop olive oil. I did so, and the angina ceased immediately even with rigorous exercise. As long as I avoid all oils, my heart does just fine! It is an outrage that olive oil is promoted as heart healthy. More big business propaganda. Oh, btw… did you know the Greeks have the highest heart attack rate in Europe!Thanks metrov, I keep clicking the thumbs up but it only gives me one vote! I lived the medical nightmare. How I wish I trusted my own council instead of the quacks. I still remember and “feel” the two halves of my sternum sliding against each other whenever I moved…the horror of showering with all those ugly stictches…the Zipper! The helplessness, the drugs, the rude creepy hospital drones…All for nothing except to line the pockets of cranks.Rhombopterix, that is horrific. I can see why you feel so strongly about no oil. Definitely the right choice! No one should have to go through that. Hope your recovery has gone well.My cardiologist, a nice person really, but after I was back on my feet I told her I still had the angina. Tears ran down my face as she explained to me that some of the goop was too deep into my heart to reach, to bypass…so there it was. I’d just have to live with it, die from it. I’ve told this story here and everywhere I can because I actually planned to end my miserable life and fear others will too, needlessly. (angina, IBS, migraines, joint pain you name it) when by pure chance I saw Forks over Knives. When you hit bottom you are ready to try something as “extreme” as eating healthy. And within a week the joint pain was gone and I could smile. 3 months and the IBS was gone and i could walk up a gentle incline without that fist clenching my heart. And one day i actually fainted because the drugs were dropping my bp BELOW minimum. I laughed because I realized what was happening. Now i laugh because my wife no longer asks if i’m “doing ok” when we go for a walk. There is no more angina. I really wonder if it is possible for you, who have no heart disease (!) to grasp what that means to me. I would do anything to reach people who I know and those I don’t BEFORE they go through this….and of course, I am the lucky one out of most who die from their first heart attack. Mine was a warning. There, thank you. I can go AFK for a while.Great story. Wonderful that you were able to turn things around without resorting to serious surgery and meds. May you continue to live in good health.It is a good thing that you share your story, but you likely had a very different starting point than many. For those that have followed whole foods plant based diets long term, and who show no easily measurable of any chronic disease, further restricting diet may well not be necessary. In fact, some populations that Dr Greger has brought attention to through this site, who display little or no heart disease, consume dairy, or oils, or both. Given that, it seems likely that getting plenty of vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes and whole grains, and avoiding animal products and processed junk, is by and large what is most important in order to avoid cardio vascular disease. Eating this way from early in life, regardless of whether the diet is truly optimal (to the extent we even know what that is currently), would free future generations from developing these diseases to begin with.Best of luckYou couldn’t be any clearer! Good for you kn figuring it out. My father died from a massage heart attack at 51. Oil? Not such a necessity.Thanks, I always feel like i’m sounding dramatic but i relive it everytime i write it. Sorry your lost your dad that way…me too and he was 52. We’ve got to teach the youth…You will appreciate, my wonderful daughter and soninlaw , because of our constant but gentle banging on have decided to raise our two grandkids WFPB! I cant describe the feeling watching little 2 year old ankle biter insisting on more kale! There is hopeThat is wonderful!How much olive oil are we talking about??? One of the studies looked at 40 TBS in a meal, which was ridiculous, and really detracts from the message. Our meals made with olive oil usually have about 1 TBS per serving. I really wonder about this…..The best proof that increased intake of olive oil promotes coronary heart disease (CHD).1 tablespoon (13.5 g) is 119 kcal, and 13.5 g of total fat. The fat breakdown is: 1.9g of saturated fat, 9.8g of monounsaturated fat (MUFA), and 1.4g of polyunsaturated fat (PUFA). W.r.t. fats, there is scientific consensus on reducing saturated fat by substituting an equal amount of polyunsaturated fat reduces cholesterol levels and lowers your chances of coronary heart disease (CHD). But there is disagreement with monounsaturated fat, which is olive oil’s main type of fat.In long-term human studies, it is impossible to isolate results of one nutrient (e.g. monounsaturated fat, i.e. oleic acid, which occurs in high-levels in both red meat and olive oil). And, in human studies that compare the mediterranean diet to the western diet, is it the EVOO (extra vrigin olive oil) or simply eating less unhealthy foods. So some studies show a positive correlation with CHD incidence and some show a negative correlation. (Note that Greger has reviewed PREDIMED mediterranean diet study that shows the highest correlation with reduced CHD is vegetables and nuts – not olive oil.) Nevertheless, the harmful/helpful question of monounsaturated fat, the main fat in olive oil persists.But one can look to the animal studies to get an answer. Strong animal rights advocates don’t like to reference such studies, for obvious reasons. But I will.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7489230 – abstract, but the full 1995 article is available for free.This was an 5 year experiment with African Green monkeys, divided into 3 groups. Each group was fed a diet high in just one of these kinds of fats: saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated. Compared to the saturated fat group, both the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated groups had better cholesterol (i.e. lower LDL). But cholesterol is just an “indication” and not a result. People die from heart disease, because of atherosclerosis (the buildup of plaque in their arteries). And, as it turns out, the monounsaturated monkey group had just as much plaque buildup as the saturated fat group.Here is the key excerpt from the abstract:“In sum, the monkeys fed monounsaturated fat developed equivalent amounts of coronary artery atherosclerosis as those fed saturated fat, but monkeys fed polyunsaturated fat developed less. The beneficial effects of the lower LDL and higher HDL in the animals fed monounsaturated fat apparently were offset by the atherogenic shifts in LDL particle composition. Dietary polyunsaturated fat appears to result in the least amount of coronary artery atherosclerosis because it prevents cholesteryl oleate accumulation in LDL and the coronary arteries in these primates.”Note the mention above of “Cholesterol Oleate”, and LDL particle composition. For additional info:1998 – Same kind of study but using transgenic mice. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/98129232010 – Review article, “Dietary Monounsaturated Fatty Acids Appear Not to Provide Cardioprotection” http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/207258102009 – “LDL cholesteryl oleate as a predictor for atherosclerosis: evidence from human and animal studies on dietary fat” http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/190291172013 – “LDL particle core enrichment in cholesteryl oleate (CO) increases proteoglycan binding and promotes atherosclerosis” http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23804810 2nd sentence from abstract, “Diet enrichment with MUFAs enhances LDL CO content.” Note: MUFA = monounsaturated fat, i.e. the main fat in olive oil.Case closed.Good to know. If you are going to feed your African green monkey unwise amounts of fat in his diet, best to make it polyunsaturated fat. But what about the monkeys fed a healthy amount of just a single type of fat? Did they show the same results? Or is it only when taken to an extreme do the results show the health effects documented in the study. But there was no low-fat monkey group(s) were there. So how do we know how the results of this study apply to human diets with healthy percent of calories from fat.I get very leery of any study that feeds its subjects an unhealthy amount of fat and then makes statements related to the relative health of different types of fat. Nutrition is not reducible to single linear relationships that apply to the entire range of consumption of a single nutrient. You can’t just extrapolate results from one end of the dietary range to the other. It is entirely possible that monosaturated fat is healthier in low amounts than either saturated or polyunsaturated fats. Or it could be that all three are equally healthy just as long as the total percent of calories is kept under a certain amount and only become a differentiated when that percentage of calories is exceeded.I 100% agree with your statement, “Nutrition is not reducible to single linear relationships that apply to the entire range of consumption of a single nutrient.” And, I agree with Campbell in his book “Whole” that it is misleading to look at the effect of foods by their individual ingredients. But people, including the medical/nutrition researchers, do.Unfortunately, most people and the mainstream media believe the EVOO is a health food.It is reasonable to be skeptical of the Green Monkey study. That is why I also included links to other studies that look at the biological reasons (i.e. operating at the cellular level) that would explain the results of the Green Monkey study. The Green Monkey study is also in accordance with intervention trials that substituted PUFA for SFA, and reduced CHD incidence. And the Green Monkey study also explains why the short-term intervention trials substitution MUFA for SFA show an improvement in cholesterol numbers (LDL down, HDL up). But the human trials w.r.t. MUFA and CHD are mixed.And, then there are also the regression studies, i.e. by Ornish and Esselstyn, that showed a regression of coronary plaque on a LF-WFPB diet. What you may find interesting is that there were regression results in animal studies as well. Here is one from 1976 that summarizes some of the results from those studies: “Evidence of regression of atherosclerosis in primates and man” http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/823537But having said that, dose does matter (one of your points – which I agree with). As I noted in a different comment, I use about 1 tbs of EVOO a day, and add sugar to my oatmeal. And, even add salt to my rice.I wasn’t disagreeing with you, just trying to be cautionary. “Whole” had a significant impact on how I view a lot of science including my own field of research which has nothing to do with human nutrition, but does have a lot of very complex interacting systems where the adage that the whole is, if not greater than, then certainly very different than the sum of its parts is very true. So rather than trying to lock everything down and vary a single parameter at a time to understand behavior of the system, I am trying to use more multi-variant methods, even going so far as using genetic optimizers to let different combinations of variables duke it out for “survival” until only one remains.I too am not “pure” in my diet. I add oil very sparingly and try to do it where it would have maximum effect and not just as a matter of course, but I certainly don’t shun it entirely. And what is oatmeal without some good real maple syrup and chopped pecans. As for unsalted rice, shudder!so in this case what kind of oil we need to use? and I’m EVOO addict too, I love to pour it on my all my foodIt appears that we do not “need to use” any sort of oil whatsoever to be healthy. That one might choose wisely and use quite sparingly (relative to the SAD) if he/she decides that his health or tastes require additional fats. Again, from all the dozens of videos and articles here, there is no “need” to add oil to your diet.Also, the reason OO has been pushed so hard is that there are lots of companies, small and large who have a profit to make selling it. It trickled down through the medical fields I’d say. Then became mantra-and popular (in every diet book and program) as it is _perceived_ to be much easier to change oils than to quit oils.Quitting isn’t hard, everything with oil/fat tastes nasty/greasy once you make the leap. But once in a blue moon, I’ll have an oily/fatty serving or two for nostalgia/tradition-but that’s my option (always keep options).Question authority and seek the truth where commercialism has any input ever.Maybe use a BP cuff and check your own endothelial response for kicks.Hey Alex, as Wade says, we should indeed avoid using oils. Here is a great article on tips to cooking without oil. http://www.forksoverknives.com/plant-based-cooking-how-to-cook-without-oil/Thanks Rami, going to check it out.What about olive leaf extract’s reported benefit in lowering blood pressure? I haven’t seen much in research but it has helped lower my bpAre you doing this on top of eating a whole-food plant-based diet with no animal products and no refined oils? If not, you are just treating a symptom of vascular ill-health rather than treating the actual root cause of that ill-health.Like Dr. Greger says, when your sink is overflowing you can work continuously for the rest of your life to mop up the mess to try to contain the damage, but that does nothing to fix the problem. You fix the problem by turning off the tap. Find the root cause and eliminate it and the symptoms will go away on their own.It may! And so many other plant foods can help lower BP, as well.It does seem to work on BP. Life Extension has a useful summary of the evidence (but of course they are pushing their own brand of supplements so it may not be a “warts and all” review): http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2012/3/olive-leaf-safely-modulates-blood-pressure/page-01However, olive leaf extract has antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties. This affects our gut bacteria but, to my knowledge, there’s not a lot of evidence on this. Therefore, we can’t conclude that the effect is either beneficial or adverse although it may be prudent to take a good quality probiotic. However, I would strongly endorse the points made by jim FelderIt seems like we’ve been told for DECADES that olive oil was good for you. Now the pendulum has swung the other way and it’s now bad for you. This is all very frustrating. We are headed down the path that the only foods GOOD for you will be raw fruits & veggies–if you can find any that don’t have poison sprayed on them. It’s like cultural food bias has modified our taste receptors to the point of no return–anything that tastes good is bad.We are headed down the path that the onlyfoods GOOD for you will be raw fruits & veggies–if you can find any that don’t have poison sprayed on themSuch is not the case with the recommendations found here. Nearly all grains, beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, herbs, spices, mushrooms, in raw or cooked form as preferred, (i.e. simply a whole foods plant based diet) are promoted here. And even non-organic fruits and veggies are emphatically recommended over an alternative of no fruits and veggies.Shubus: I totally understand your frustration. But I find this video to be a breath of fresh air. This video shows how the science behind olive oil really hasn’t changed. It’s just “our” ability to communicate and understand the studies that has been a problem.This site and other respectable ones show that there is a wide range of very healthy food and that the boom line message of the science which supports this set of foods has largely been unchanged for decades. Eat in great abundance: veggies, fruits, legumes, and whole intact grains. Add about an ounce nuts and seeds. And don’t forget the B12. Voila!re: “that don’t have poison sprayed on them” This site has a great video series on organic food. Watching that series would help put this fear of poison sprays into perspective. The risk from non-organic food (especially in the context of a whole plant food diet) is not as big as I’m guessing you think.re: “anything that tastes good is bad.” Tastes can and do change. Many people find that after they eat healthy for a while, they not only like their new healthy food, but the old unhealthy food just doesn’t taste very good any more.The premise that olive oil was good for us was based on the Mediterranean studies. Dr. Greger has some great videos regarding what makes the Mediterranean diet truly healthy. I think you will find it of interest.This video is the first of a series of several. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-was-heart-disease-rare-in-the-mediterranean/Click Next video on the right hand side to see the next one in the series.So, have they tested ALL kind of fats explicitly for this arterial impairment?That is, can it be shown that the same happens regardless whether the fats contain or are exclusively composed of mono- / poly-unsaturated fats, omega 3 fats, saturated fats, trans fats?Or have the tests not been done to that level of detail, thus we don’t know which forms of fats or specific fatty acids are to blame for the post-prandial arterial function decline?Some, I won’t name names, claims that it’s just the unsaturated fats and/or oils that are to blame and that “saturated fats” are NOT to blame or are even health-promoting (or at worst non-harmful). I don’t necessarily buy it…Would like a definitive answer, if there is one.Likewise, interested to know whether high doses of fructose (which we should now by now isn’t handled well by the body and converts to cholesterol / fatty acids in the blood) will see the same impairment of arterial function, given they convert to circulating blood fatty acids, likely not unlike what you get from high fat meals? If so, at what dosage do sugars (in particular fructose) start doing similar damage or otherwise impairing function?Been following the fat vs. sugar debate for a few years, and can see both sides, just haven’t see the “definitive test(s)” yet that nail down one or the other or [likely] both as [equal?] culprit(s)… Seems like the anti-sugar folks sometimes say “fats are fine, it’s the fructose that’s the problem,” and the anti-fat folks say that carbs are fine and it’s the fats we need to pare down on. I just wonder if it’s a little of both (fats being a problem, but fructose also being a problem, since it does double duty in getting converted into fat in the bloodstream [that eventually turns into adiposity])…Sorry I can’t give you that definitive answer, but feel compelled to comment. As I’ve learned (mostly from here as I’ve been digging and scratching through these archives since the first of the year) one is probably best without any added sugars or fats.So that’s how I roll, and it is wonderful. Feel better, got lighter, cannot WAIT to get my cholesterol and lipids checked. Also fully expect better performance on the bike when I get back into training.My point is that once one makes a dietary shift such as I have, there is no reason to waste another wink of energy on which sweetener is better or which oil is better. My consumption of either is so minute as to render their impact on my health completely inconsequential.It’s a good place, and eating each meal until one is satisfied with ZERO regrets or reservations is a great thing too.there is no reason to waste another wink of energy on which sweetener is better or which oil is better. My consumption of either is so minute as to render their impact on my health completely inconsequential.It’s a good place, and eating each meal until one is satisfied with ZERO regrets or reservations is a great thing too.Hear, hear! I think for the most part, once we’re all past the WFPB diet point, we tend to get into the area of the “narcissism of small differences”, as Jeff Novick once referred to it. I also agree that anxiety about these things has the potential to do more harm than good.>> narcissism of small differencesWow, that is a great phrase. See a lot of that these days. Maybe we get it from advertising, or an unconscious understanding of how stupid little things affect us all?Yes, advertising I’m sure plays a role. Few messages we receive are from a place of true advocacy. Most come from a place of someone trying to sell us one particular thing. Also I think a lot of people like the feeling of identifying with a certain “camp”. In addition in some cases I think it’s fueled by people who hope that all of their issues can be solved by getting that one tiny thing in their life right, as opposed to looking at their food and lifestyle in a more holistic sense. If you can say with certainty that you’re absolutely right about this one little thing, well then you’ve got it all figured out haven’t you! Whereas other people I think are a bit more comfortable with uncertainty in general. Or perhaps it’s an issue of perfectionism, where some are happy with a 90-99% “perfect” diet, where others will settle for no less than 100%.If you want to see Jeff in action here it is. Relevant section is from 40 sec to about 3 min mark. I sometimes think that whole statement should be offered as a disclaimer prior to every conversation about nutrition.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCyltD4xyb4The entire basis of most nutritional research is to reduce the focus of investigation to smallest degree possible with small perturbations of a single variable so that any resulting changes can be shown to be the direct effect of that change. This highly reductionist approach works relatively well in physics, somewhat in chemistry, poorly in biochemistry and not at all in nutrition. But this focus on small differences to the point of narcissism is held up as the gold standard for research in nutrition. How many times have we heard, “well yes you can see that in large populations studies, but those studies can only generate correlations and (say it with me here) correlation doesn’t equal causation. It has it been verified in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over studies?”, as if the results of such a narrowly focused study would somehow overturn the observed fact that the health of societies varies with the dominate eating pattern and that some eating patterns are associated with healthier societies and other eating patterns are associated with sicker societies. We don’t need to wait on the ultimate reductionist trial to know which way the nutritional winds are blowing and in which direction we should be sailing.And all of this has bleed over into the way the general public views nutrition research unfortunately without any real understand of the limits and pitfalls of such a reductionist approach. I think it is leading to an orthorexic eating disorder in many people and those who follow a plant-based diet are not immune. And in fact might be more susceptible than most.Highly, highly highly recommend reading T. Colin Campbell’s book “Whole” for an eye opening discussion of this issue.“highly recommend reading T. Colin Campbell’s book “Whole” for an eye opening discussion of this issue.” Especially diet tweakers that just wait for the latest research on the whatever to get their diet just right.as if the results of such a narrowly focused study would somehow overturn the observed fact that the health of societies varies with the dominate eating pattern and that some eating patterns are associated with healthier societies and other eating patterns are associated with sicker societies. We don’t need to wait on the ultimate reductionist trial to know which way the nutritional winds are blowing and in which direction we should be sailing.I couldn’t agree more, Jim. As much as I support a sense of curiosity and scientific inquiry without limits, sometimes I wonder what would happen if we put a moratorium on all health/nutrition research and funneled all of that money into commercials, billboards, educational TV specials, educational programs for physicians etc, just to get the word out to the general public about the massive amount of life changing disease eradicating information we already know. Watch disease rates plummet, then reassess where the truly meaningful questions lie and where we want our money to go.Imagine if we had all the research we already have on smoking and lung cancer and 99% of the population still smoked, yet saw almost nothing about quitting smoking in the general media, in fact were continually exposed to intense advertising in favor of cigarettes, and saw only vague recommendations like “choose healthier cigarette options” from the organizations in charge of promoting public health. And random studies showing tenuous and contextually irrelevant links between lung cancer and perhaps shampoo or tv preferences were picked up and obsessed over by the lay media. And everyone sits at home on the couch, smoking, thinking oh boy better look into that shampoo connection.Sorry for the rambling. Democratization of knowledge and social media certainly tends to amplify all of the reductionist irrelevant stuff, but I have hope that the broader truths may at some point be amplified to a point of general awareness and consensus as well. After all we all managed to find our ways here. I’ve gotta send some recipes this week to the in laws at their request, so there’s hope for the future yet.“Imagine if we had all the research we already have on smoking and lung cancer and 99% of the population still smoked, yet saw almost nothing about quitting smoking in the general media, …”We call that the 1950s. And perhaps like we did with cigarettes, one day advertising junk food on TV, especially food aimed at children, will be banned and for exactly the same reason.Vitamin C can improve endothelial function. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792921 As can Vitamin D. We are a rarity among animals in not being able to produce vitamin C, according to Linus Pauling. Our true need for Vitamin C might be well above what a modern diet provides.Only because modern diets are in general devoid of nutrients. Refined carbohydrates and oils and animal products do not contribute to meeting our vitamin C needs and they displace from our diets the unrefined whole plant foods that do. The answer isn’t to take pills, it is to eat more of the food that has the nutrients we need and less to none of the foods that don’t. When you do that getting enough vitamin C is no effort at all. Really just that simple.Okay, so humans and some apes, including Gorillas, can’t make Vitamin C. We are alone in the animal world, with the exception of guinea pigs and some bats and a bird in our lack of ability to make Vitamin C. Did you know that the USDA recommends Guinea Pig food to have about 800 mg of Vitamin C? They quickly get heart disease and die without it. I challenge you to find a diet that has that much Vitamin C for people, or anyone who is on one. Our recommended daily allotment of Vitamin C is one tenth that, and we obviously are much bigger than guinea pigs. http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v06n08.shtml These are Dr. Linus Pauling’s arguments. Many people here challenge the paleolithic diet. As primates, we probably sampled leaves and seeds all day filled with the vitamins C and Niacin for a longer period of our evolutionary history. We seem to have adapted to live with scurvy as a species, because of the advantage of keeping our glucose instead of turning it into vitamin C. Dr. Greger has many videos showing that there are oxidation spikes in the diet at meal time, and once healthy food is adsorbed. Likely animals make vitamin C at these times. Dr. Pauling simply is modern chemistry, and is the chemistry both medical and high school students study, and he even found a link between Vitamin C and heart disease as he was being dismissed for saying Vitamins were good for us. Vitamin C and lysine, he found, could unplug arteries in doses of 6 and 3 grams a day each respectively. I hope that there is more than one solution for the health problems of the world, because surely you know it will take some time to get people onto this diet. We are clearly missing a few plants in our diet and not everything about plants is above what biochemistry we understand. I love NASA.You are probably right but in practice I find that if I do not supplement with vitamin C, I get the flu or heavy colds 3 or 4 times a year. If I do supplement, 1 gram in the morning and 1 gram in the evening, then I just don’t get these infections. Of course, my whole food plant based diet is less than perfect so that might be the reason but I do eat plenty of greens and fruits everyday.Another great piece from the best site on the internet, and so many of the comments are really helpful too. I have a question: Are there any oils that are healthy (or neutral) that I could either cook with OR add to my salad? Think the answer is no but wanted to double check.noExtra virgin olive oil still seems pretty neutral. If you doubt that, or are unwilling to deal with the associated risk (but to be clear, we don’t yet know what it is), then maybe best to avoid it.I would be cautious with oil Gary. Although it may taste good, its one of the most calorie dense foods on the planet providing the least nutritional value. Yes extra virgin has a tiny amount of antioxidants in small amounts, but the overall nutrient density is extremely poor. Take a look at its nutritionfacts. http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fats-and-oils/509/21 tablespoon is about 120 calories, at that point your eating oil with salad not salad with oil. This is especially a problem for those who struggle with weight loss, although that may not be specific to your situation. Here is a great article on how to cook without oil and some substitutes. http://www.forksoverknives.com/plant-based-cooking-how-to-cook-without-oil/Thankyou Rami, Roger and Rhombo – sound like a group! For taking the time to reply. I will try and apply the wise advice, just another example of how you can be an unhealthy vegan. Putting on weight isnt one of my concerns actually, keeping it on is more of a challenge since switching to plant-based eating.This is a good reminder. Even here one sees people defending Olive Oil like it was a close friend or their ingredient for life support. You see big fat cooks on the cooking shows slopping olive oil into their foods like it was water, or medicine. As many of the You-Tube doctors remind us … oil is pretty much oil. I’ve never used oil, olive or otherwise on salads. I use Balsamic vinegar or just lemon juice … perhaps you can tell me if that is as bad for us as the oil?Hi Dr Greger. Would this be the same for nut oils? Say for walnut oil. Ive been infusing olive oil with tumeric and thought i was onto a good thing. Im on a vegan raw diet growing my own sprouts but dont want another heart attack. Thanks SteveIt appears that all refined oils have a negative effect on the endothelial cells lining your arteries. It is only when the fats in nuts come along with all the other nutrients contained in nuts is the net effect of nuts positive. Here is an article in the blog section of this website from just last week that talks about this. http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/13/how-walnuts-can-improve-artery-function/I have a suggestion, because all these reductionist studies and opinions make my head spin. I try to imagine myself in an environment where I have to provide myself with all my food. Personally, I’m not going to kill anything, suck the milk from other animals, or go through all the trouble to squeeze the hell out of a perfectly good food so I can use just the greasy drippings. WHY would I when I can just consume the food it is part of ??? We are so brainwashed by what we’ve become accustomed to, we don’t think. I just make it simple for myself. Eat a wide variety of WHOLE food in season, drink clean water, “listen” to my body, and stay off my butt for long periods of time, as we have for millennia . The rest is food for thought.What a hoot. Good one> go through all the trouble to squeeze the hell out of a perfectly good food so I can use just the greasy drippings.Hahaha, that’s hilarious.I think all these customer came out of honest attempts at survival. For example people used to salt food so they could have something to eat when they could not catch game. Milk was a source of fat and calories and you can make cheese from it and store it. If I had to guess at some reason for all of this I’d say it was the expansion of the human population past the point of hunting and gathering which was the idea to support.And the reason we have to have high population is the same reason today, bigger populations take over. It’s war. The root cause of all this stuff is that humans cannot get along and fight over everything, so in our respective societies we call give up a lot of our lives and health, and something die or kill others in horrible ways so that our traditions prevail over others … even if there is not logical reason for them to.An insane species rules this planet, no doubt. The folks who make a move to drop some of the more obvious toxic traditions and turn to science and rationality even seem weird for that we are so used to business as usual.its all about those fruits and veggies!I wish to ask the doctor: Why do you not talk about antinutrients in grains and seeds and nuts and beans and the need to soak the seeds (usually overnight) before cooking? There are many antinutrients in whole wheat for example–gluten in just one of several. It is claimed traditional cultures soak or sprout nearly every grain and seed. Vegetables too have toxins–parsnips for example. Cassava (AKA manioc, yuca) is notoriously poisonous before processing.He does actually! Check out these videos regarding the “anti-nutrients”. http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=antinutrientsRami good to see you posting again. Between semesters?Well I took a hiatus in January and never got up to speed since due to a variety of factors. You will be seeing more of me around.Excellent!I was wondering what would be a good substitute for olive oil. I know fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) need fat to be absorbed in the gut. Previously I thought adding olive oil and vinegar to salad can facilitate this process but regarding this video, what should be used to help absorption of these vitamins while eating a salad.Olives, avocados, nuts and seeds. Seems obvious for me.Hey Parissa, Jeff Novick has thoughts on this. I will share them here.Absorbing more doesn’t automatically equate to better health outcomes.Speaking of health outcomes, which is what really matters, lets put all of this into proper perspective.From“‘Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, and Carotenoids’, Food and Nutrition Board. Institute of Medicine. National Academy Press, Washington D.C. Pp. 343-344 (2000)”http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9810&page=353“These data, although in varying populations, suggest that 3 to 6 mg/day of β-carotene from food sources is prudent to maintain plasma β-carotene concentrations in the range associated with a lower risk of various chronic disease outcomes (see Table 3).”Table 3:http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9810&page=341As just detailed, plasma and tissue concentrations of carotenoids have been associated with a variety of health outcomes; that is, higher concentrations are associated with a lower risk of cancer, coronary heart disease, and all-cause mortality. This could be used as a possible indicator for establishing requirements for carotenoids. However, the limitation of this approach is that it is not clear whether observed health benefits are due to carotenoids per se or to other substances found in carotenoid-rich foods.Thus, these data are suggestive of prudent intake levels, not required levels of intake. Recommendations have been made by a number of federal agencies and other organizations with regard to fruit and vegetable intake. Nutrient analysis of menus adhering to the U.S. Dietary Guidelines and the National Cancer Institute’s Five-a-Day for Better Health Program, for example, indicates that persons following these diets would be consuming approximately 5.2 to 6.0 mg/day provitamin A carotenes on average if a variety of fruits and vegetables were consumed (Lachance, 1997). Similar levels would be obtained by following Canada’s Food Guide for Healthy Eating which specifies a minimum of five servings of vegetables and fruit (Health Canada, 1997). Other food-based dietary patterns recommended for the prevention of cancer and other chronic diseases would provide approximately 9 to 18 mg/day of carotenoids (WCRF/AICR, 1997).NOTE: this is 3-6x the amount recognized as being enough to lower disease riskIt is also based on the WCRF/AICR report from 1997. In many other discussions here, I have quoted the WCRF/AICR newest report from 2007 saying that they now more than ever, recommend dietary “patterns” over recommending specific “individual foods”.So, in other words, if Americans would just get in the recommended amounts of fruits and veggies, it would not only provide carotenoids, but more than enough of all of them to produce the beneficial health outcomes, including reduced risks of cancer. And anyone following a Whole Food plant based diet, as recommended here, would already be consuming WAY more than enough.A well sealed or seasoned cast iron pan is a great way to start. Actually, this is a good use for oil. Use flax seed oil to seal or season your pan and you can saute without using oil. Use food grade flax seed oil (also know as linseed) and use the instructions you find at the America’s test kitchen site.http://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5820-the-ultimate-way-to-season-cast-iron?extcode=MASCZ00L0&ref=search_results_11The Italians have been using it for centuries and they are very healthy.Italians use fresh olive oil. “Olive oil, unlike wine, does not improve with time. Just the opposite. Olives, after all, are a fruit. And just as with fruit juice, olive oil is at its zenith of flavor and nutritional goodness immediately after it’s pressed. This is why the locals in the olive-growing regions of Italy, Spain, Greece, and other Mediterranean countries use fresh-pressed oil.” T. J. RobinsonWhile that is partially true, most Italians consuming olive oil are not consuming it in the form you describe. Olive oils certainly vary greatly in composition, and fresh extra virgin olive oil is clearly superior.Italians have also been consuming larger quantities of fresh vegetables and fruits, whole grains and legumes for centuries. I think that they are healthy to the degree they are in spite of the olive oil, not because of it and would be even healthier if they cut back.And the supposedly healthy Italians rapidly becoming less so as they adopt more of the American way of eating lots of animal foods and increasingly more and more prepackaged and highly processed foods and fewer whole plant foods. The thing that is remaining constant is the olive oil. If the source of their health was in the olive oil, their health would probably not be declining as rapidly as it is.OBTW, the healthy Mediterranean diet that is talked about comes mostly from a study of the people living on the island of Crete in the years after World War II when the island was trying to crawl out from the devastation of the war. The people were extremely poor and ate a diet with lots of simple whole plant foods especially wild greens. And they walked on average 9 miles a day up and down their hilly island because there was the only way for most to get around. It may have not done great things for their spirit, but the privation did great things for their health. The diet those people ate bears little in common with the current Italian or Spanish diet other than the olive oil.After a couple of decades Crete fully recovered and the people there started to eat the same crap that all the richer countries around the Mediterranean were eating and got as sick and as fat as they are.The only thing that make people around the Mediterranean appear healthy is that they are not as sick and as fat as we are. Compared to truly healthy cultures like rural Africa, China and India, who still eat simple plant-based diets with very little animal foods, the Italians don’t look so healthy.Many in rural India eat a good deal of dairy and oil. Clearly, the source of health is not the dairy and the oil, in the same way olive oil is not the source of health for Italians, for the reasons you pointed out. Nor is it making them sick. You may reply that they are well despite the dairy and oil. I would agree. But I would also say that these foods are not nearly as bad as they are made out to be in the context of a highly nutritious largely whole foods plant based diet high in antioxidants. In the context of the standard American diet, they suck. For people with far superior diets, they seem to do little harm.The problem with “J” curves with regard to the non-linear health response to varying amounts of unhealthy foods is that the knee in the curve where the negative health effects sharply increase is not visible and you don’t always know which side you are operating on until possibly years in the future when the damage may already be done and you are consigned to the much tougher task of trying to reverse the damage rather much simpler task of avoiding damage in the first place.I know at some level of consumption that meat, eggs, dairy, refined oils and refined sugars will damage my health. Further I know that not consuming these things will not damage my health. So rather than trying to finesse right up the edge of harm with these foods, I simply avoid them to the greatest extent possible so that I have confidence that I am well back from the inflection point.I would like to know if saturated fats from plant foods like nut butters would also cause the artery impairment. I know that nut butters are not as noxious as animal fats in that they are better metabolized and in some cases have been shown to exert some protection against arterial plaques. That would lead me to think that they may not cause this kind of endothelial impairment. This is just my conjecture, though. Dr. Greger any answer you have will be much appreciated.Nut butters contain more than just fat. Nuts also contain many other molecules that are active in the body that are likely the explanation for why nuts, whole or as ground butters, are health promoting while the amount of fat they contain would indicate that should have a negative impact on health. It isn’t because the fat is somehow magically different in the whole food as opposed to as extracted oil. It is that during the extraction process, the health promoting aspects are left behind.So a meal of nuts, gram for gram in fat, would not have a similar affect on arterial function as extra virgin olive oil?It will, greater or less depends on specific nuts and their Omega-3 content, but nuts are beneficial in the long-term. It is possible that olive oil has some health promoting effects, but the main point of this site is that whole food is always better than extracts. Olives and nuts are better than olive oil, though it doesn’t mean that olive oil is unhealthy. If you need extra calories, olive oil is better than sugar, I suppose.I’m not sure that it is the main point of this web-site, but that is certainly what the science reviewed on this web-site shows.And why would olive oil be better than sugar if you needed extra calories? Neither is great in large quantities, but the body basically runs on carbohydrates, and so it can make more direct and immediate use of the calories. Fat can not be used in the same way. The problem with sugar is the same one as olive oil and that neither brings anything to speak of to the party except calories. Better to eat some fruit if you need some quick energy and nuts or seeds if you want some fat because you also get something more than just calories in the deal.Because olive oil contains healthy (or somewhat neutral) fats and some phytonutrients, is slowly absorbed, while sugar doesn’t have any beneficial components and is rapidly absorbed, causing spikes in blood sugar, which can’t be a good thing.I’m totally for nuts, seeds and fruits. But they take space in your stomach, which is limited. What if we need more calories than we can consume with whole foods? It’s not a problem for most people, but what about highly active individuals and kids? Kids have smaller stomaches, what if they need extra calories for proper growth?If you have normal insulin sensitivity, blood sugar spikes aren’t a bad thing. It is only when fat has so clogged your muscles that they don’t respond to insulin signaling as they should does high blood sugar become a problem because it stays high chronically. That isn’t to say that you want to guzzle sugar water all the time because eventually all that extra sugar will exceed the ability of the body to store it as glycogen and it will be converted to fat. Still not a good idea to eat refined sugar or refined fat because they are nutrient deserts.As for kids, even the most active can get all the calories they need from whole foods. Even more important is that they also need a lot of nutrients in order to grow properly, and refined sugar and oils don’t have any. So giving them this type of food is cheating them out of the nutrients their bodies desperately need. I have read a report that pediatricians are now treating obese kids with acute vitamin deficiencies. Simultaneously overfed and malnourished.The trouble is that kids like all humans prefer artificially concentrated foods like sugar and fat because of evolutionary triggers that says that these things are good and should be sought out. We evolved that because these things used to be hard to get. You would have to walk miles to hunt down an animal sometimes at considerable risk to get a bit of fat or work for hours to harvest berries to get a bit of sweet. The reward circuits in your brain gave you a little “at a boy” when you could get some extra sweet or extra fatty food to encourage you to put out the effort to find more. Today we just have to open the refrigerator or cupboard. As a adults we in theory have the ability to go against that innate drive because we understand the consequences, but kids can’t. And so they will go for the junk as often as they can. Our job as adults is to protect them from themselves until they are old enough to make better decisions on their own and help them along the way to learn what those better decisions are.> As for kids, even the most active can get all the calories they need from whole foods.I really want that to be true.You don’t think that is the case? My son is two and a half years old. He eats oil in his pasta sauces. He also eats meat, eggs and dairy, but for the sake of family harmony there is little I can do about that at the moment. Our major government health bodies all promote eggs, dairy, fish and lean meat as important components of a healthy diet.When I am walking in the wilderness with a backpack, or bike packing, I eat plenty of fatty meals. I need to carry my food with me and I need that food to be very dense in calories. I have sweet things too, but too much sugar just pumps me up only to crash a little later. Having some higher fat meals helps to balance out my energy throughout the day.I think WFPB is sufficient to meet energy needs of most people (well, you have to eat a lot), including kids, but I’m not a reputable source, how can I convince other people?WFPB or not, getting my boy to eat enough vegetables it tough. I’ve succeeded thus far, but not without enormous effort. I understand how parents fall into the convenience trap.If David Carter can do it and maintain weight and strength to be an NFL defensive lineman, then anybody can do it.http://www.gq.com/story/vegan-diet-of-nfl-player-david-carterLeonid: re”… how can I convince other people?”I don’t know if there is a particular scientific paper or not, but I can say that there are lots of people raising kids on a whole plant food diet, and the kids are *thriving.*Another bit of info that might be helpful is this quote: “It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.”Or check out: http://www.pcrm.org/pdfs/health/info_children.pdf http://www.pcrm.org/pdfs/health/info_advchild.pdfBut it’s my guess that if you are having to “convince other people,” none of these sources is going to be compelling to them. The only thing that might work is for them to see the WFPB kids with their own eyes, but even that may not work. Getting our culture to understand and follow healthy eating habits is just going to be a long road I think. Not that we shouldn’t try. We should! But I don’t think there is a smoking gun for this particular question. Just my opinion.Yes our government largely works to support the health of the animal food industry rather than the health of the American public. That should be no surprise. Most of the high level executives in the USDA come directly out of the ranks of lobbyists for Big Food or were executives in a Big Food company. And when they retire from government service they return to the swamp from which they crawled.The 2015 dietary recommendations are a real shot across the bow of these immense financial interest. It will be very enlightening to see how successful these huge commercial interests are as they deploy their toadies inside the USDA to eviscerate these actually healthy recommendations.And when backpacking I too look to maximize the caloric density of the food I carry at the expense of its nutrient density. On trips of a week and longer, I would carry freeze-dried food to get the maximum density. Some Native Americans and fur traders did something similar with pemmican, a mix of dried meat, fat and sometimes dried fruit and for exactly the same reason. But I am glad that I don’t have to do this everyday, since eating this way frequently would not be good for long term health.As a child I did not have a sweet tooth, as my brother did, but I did eat fat from cuts of meat before I would get stuck into the meat itself. It is very unlikely this was due to some deficiency, as our household ate a great deal more fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains than our neighbors did, in part due to the preference for Indian dishes that my father grew up with. I have long suspected that my reward system was just wired up that way and my brothers was wired up more for sweet things. Despite my fat cravings and my brother’s love of the sugary, we both had low BMIs in the normal range throughout our childhood.Sure, nuts have benefits in the long run, it seems. But my question was very specific and was about arterial function following a meal as measured by the study discussed in this video.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3652880/?report=classicWalnuts impair endothelial function after a meal (while walnut oil doesn’t). It’s all I have. I think all nuts/seeds have similar impact, except flaxseed, probably. I can’t compare the strength of this effect with other nuts and oils, but it is present, without a doubt.Thanks, LeonidFascinating share Leonid, I am unsure if there should be a final conclusion made though, it seems there are mixed results depending on the health of the individuals and other factors. For example, this study http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109706019127 highlighted in this video http://nutritionfacts.org/video/walnuts-and-artery-function/ found that walnuts improve FMD. The study you shared actually discusses this study in the discussion section: “Another explanation for the lack of a whole walnut effect on endothelial function could reflect the participant population studied. In a study conducted by Cortés et al. (13), acute consumption of walnuts (40 g) ingested with a high-fat meal increased FMD (24%) in hypercholesterolemic adults (TC: 250 ± 25 mg/dL) compared with the same meal with olive oil (25 g) but not in adults with normal TC concentrations (TC: 185 ± 27 mg/dL). In the present study, participants had TC concentrations that were comparable with the normocholesterolemic participants in the Cortés et al. (13) study, which may explain why we also observed no postprandial change in endothelial function after whole walnut consumption.”Interesting results indeed, I would be interested if more research came from this. We have a few interesting studies but more needs to be done to reach a final conclusion in my opinion.I wouldn’t think so. For one nuts have considerably more nutrients including anti-oxidants and infinitely more fiber than olive oil. As this video mentioned, the anti-oxidants in vegetables in the Mediterranean diet mediate the impacts of the olive oil on the endothelium. I would expect the anti-oxidants in nuts to do the same. Also the fiber in the nuts changes the rate that the fats in the nuts is absorbed, so that would change the amount of fat in the blood, since the body is also working to remove the fat and put it into storage. So a slower pace allows the body to stay more even with absorbtion.Perhaps so. I see that it would possibly be the case. I’d like to see the evidence though. 1/4 cup of olive oil with bread versus 1/4 cup of fats from nuts eaten as whole nuts, so whatever amount that happens to be. I suspect the difference would be negligible, so I’ll have to wait for the evidence.Check out this video regarding walnuts vs olive oil for artery function http://nutritionfacts.org/video/walnuts-and-artery-function/This one is gonna be tough. It’s one of those things I had a premonition about, but was hopeful for a different result…It is nice to read all of the support coming in though about how much better it is on the other side. I expect to find the same eventual repulsion as I now do to meat, butter, cheese and milk creams. Thanks for the video.You are tough Daniel enuf. You will learn a new level that transcends tough and takes you to brouf…grouff…brombeldroufff. For me it was like reestablishing contact with … me.but you know that cuz yu did that stuff you listed. Dont even thinkabouditlike when rocky got up real early in philidelphia and drank those raw eggs and they played that great music, and it hurt the first time but then he just ran up the courthouse steps that one morning and it didnt hurt cuz he had guts, he had 1 ton of guts…except dont drink the eggs….please dont drink the eggs. hehOh my goodness. The best online comment I’ve ever received. haha. thank you,I finally got over my cheese addiction…and now olive oil! I’ll will try giving up using oil in cooking…gradually! As I learn to cook without it….I will try hihiForks over Knives did an article on tips for cooking without oil. I recommend viewing it. http://www.forksoverknives.com/plant-based-cooking-how-to-cook-without-oil/What Rami said … plus i add that we (me and ann) decided to wean ourselves off oil. YOU CAN! we just went to our minimum oil use which was 1 scant tsp of oil olive in the pan to complete the required sacrificial ritual sauteing of the onions and then …really happened…we stopped and looked at each other with that look …and then just put in water and cooked up the food and the onions and Gazelle (great name btw), it was just fine…the saute thing…that smell hit when ur cooking…do it with water onion cumin asafoetida old sox anything! its all food that you cook up and smell. learn to love it. OK the dirty sox was vor shock value but you dig it.Hi Dr. Greger,I love your videos! A whole foods plant based lifestyle has been the best thing that ever happened to me. A friend of mine sent this study on olive oil after I shared your video on olive oil and artery function. He is also vegan but is adamant about extra virgin cold pressed olive oil being healthy. I myself always cook oil free. Just wondering your thoughts about this study. Thank you. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25460732tHello Linda. The link you posted does not work – can you check and repost please?Here where I’m living now, Portugal, I see that people are proud of their “Mediterranean diet”, mentioning olive oil as a main reason. But they use it mostly to bathe their cod fish, fry their steak and braise their rice, and spice the little (really little) lettuce + tomato salad, the key component that allows them to say they eat vegetables and healthy. Soup is mostly for the kids, ‘forced’ on them in exchange for candy, since their taste buds are pretty addicted. Just thought you would find interesting to know.Here’s another translation aiming to change exactly that: http://nf.focoempatico.net/azeite-funcao-arterial-endotelio/Shift of gears: Vitamin D. Dr. Pam says forget it. No change in health outcome. She discusses it:https://youtu.be/P8JV0yPWGxQ?t=1m She’s my another favorite veggie doc of mine.This study showed that there is no significant benefit to bone and muscle health in postmenopausal woman from vitamin D supplementation, and only. I don’t think we should expand these results on other groups of people. You can’t tell anything about cancer and mortality rates based on this study. One year is too short to assess many effects of vitamin D supplementation, and this study doesn’t put accent at them. I suspect that young vegans living closer to the North Pole who exercise regularly will benefit more than any other group, but there are no studies like this. There was no calcium supplementation with that intervention. I think this study is too limited to make any conclusion from it.Thanks for looking at it. Dr. Popper has discussed many other vitamin D studies as well, that was just the latest one. Some are probably better than others. She typically only shares two or three specific reports in each of her videos, but has been doing this sort of work for a good while.There are some people who dutifully take 400 IU of D3 a day until their doctor runs a D3 test and they get found deficient. The D3 daily requirement level was recently raised, I think this is international news, but I was unaware of the change until recently. D3 was twice released by the pharmaceutical companies as an anti-cancer drug. D3 is a hormone that is linked to treating many diseases, and in my opinion, has powerful youth promoting even resetting abilities. D3 is a hormone that helps the body remember how your bones are shaped. You turn over your body weight in ATP everyday, with much of the Phosphorus coming out of your bones to be redeposited. D3 is part of the rebuilding process. So, people with COPD and MS have been cured with D3. The sunniest places on the Earth, near the equator, have much less cancer (but more skin cancer), asthma, and obesity because of D3. D3 is one of the federally mandated supplements in milk. The federal government knows it is good for you, even very good for you, and is making you take it. If you are not drinking milk you need to take D3, according to this website. The federal government’s program does not reach everyone as intended and a D3 deficiency (lung and colon disease) is all around. Why let them choose for you? Make sure you ask for a D3 blood test.I never looked at anyone’s recommendation but Dr. Greger. The government?! Milk?! I have no interest in either of these things. Most especially the latter one. I listen to doctors (the few I choose to trust) comment on studies and reports of research that is deemed to be reasonably unbiased and accurate. None of those think that the consumption of any dairy cow milk is a good idea and one is convinced that the D added to milk is completely ineffective.With people like Walter Willett promoting olive oil and the suggestion that it may be neutral on endothelial function, I’d be more inclined to go with the overall benefits, not just endothelial function. Cancer, dementia, depression, diabetes, longevity, overall mortality. And like cloudy apple juice in one of Greger’s other video’s and after reading Jo Robinson’s “Eating on the Wild Side” it’s not enough to test extra virgin olive oil, it has to be “unfiltered” extra virgin olive oil. Cloudy extra virgin olive oil. If it says “unfiltered” on the label and it doesn’t look cloudy, I’m not buying it.Likewise just saying polyphenols and looking at total amounts is selling the oil short. Squalene (the shark anti-cancer nutrient) oleocanthal, oleopeurin etc are unique chemicals. Other plants have other polyphenol combinations and regular olives are full of sodium which carries it’s own risk. For me right now, I’d say looking at this debate, there seems to be general agreement 1/4 cup is too much and 1/4 teaspoon is ok. All right fair enough. 2 teaspoons. 80 calories. The dose is the poison after all. To each their own. Planty pants and Jim made some good points on each side. Thanks for the discussion.PaulUnique doesn’t equate to well proven, or without alternatives in chemical or source. There are tons and tons of unique chemicals with thin benefits hypothesized for them but not demonstrated to be robust. It’s a little ironic that you mention squalene in an argument promoting unique sources of unique chemicals, not only because I suspect that it has more basis in hype than in evidence — that sharks don’t get cancer is a popular myth around which hype can be built, and the chemical’s manifest purpose in the shark is buoyancy, making an anti-cancer adaptation less plausible to begin with — but also because squalene itself is quite literally always at your fingertips.Well proven that the chemicals are in the oil or well proven that they have healthful properties? Alternatives. Of course there are alternatives, trade offs. Higher sodium in whole olives. Higher concentrations of oleic acid, oleopeurin, oleocanthal, and squalene. Sharks getting or not getting cancer is a red herring, forgive the fish pun. The point is that squalene has anti-cancer properties http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/6/12/1101.long http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4057827/ The potential role of olives and products like olive oil should be considered carefully particularly since Dr. Greger said that the oil might neutral on endothelial function but with evidence it might do a whole of help more than harm in other areas. Are there any prospective cohort trials showing olive oil consumption causes heart attack or stroke, diabetes, autoimmune disease, metabolic syndrome. FMD is a marker. How hard is the evidence that olive oil consumed in moderation poses any health risk. After all you take two asprin you get headache relief. You swallow half the bottle and your on your way to the emergency room to get your stomach pumped. The dose is the poison. Are there any studies showing that someone consuming two teaspoons of unfiltered extra virgin olive oil has reduced endothelial function? no. Do we know that it wasn’t the bread that cause the endothelial dysfunction in the second reference that planty pants makes? No. Juries still out for me. I know olive oil is caloric but that is what measuring spoons are for. :)It has anti-cancer properties in some situations. The first review basically says that there are a few animal studies i and a few in vitro studies, nThe Newark article points a mechanism for action in the animal data that is corroborated by human trial. Remember part of the Bradford Hill criteria is establishing a mechanism. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria That and the Rahmani reference demonstrates a large health benefit from olive oil across a range of conditions, not just heart health which Greger concedes is neutral. And we don’t even know if the oil was unfiltered or not. One the two teaspoons, sure lower dose can mean lower effect but it’s the total package that makes the final health outcome. And I am comfortable I’m not getting fat on 80 calories of oil. But am getting some unique polyphenols which will produce a wide range of human health benefits with strong epi and clinical data. YMMVAll benefits that apply to olive oil also apply to olives, but to a greater degree. If your aim is in maximizing benefits from your food, then you would better eat whole olives, nuts and seeds, than oils from them. When you consume oils, you are getting a lot of calories with little nutrition, while you can get the same amount of calories but with higher nutrition density from whole foods. Your TDEE limits the amount of healthy foods you can eat in a day, and consuming oils/sugars/other processed food you are limiting it further.Ok, true but regular olives are high in sodium, and olive oil isn’t. 2 tsp is 80 calories and its misceable. I can mix it in with other flavor components such as vinegar, garlic, lemon zest, etc. Mixes better, lower sodium. I think some of each rather than all or nothing.I am glad someone mentioned that. I’m not a salt lover, and most olives I just cannot eat. I can take a light sprinkling of olives on my Subway vegetarian sandwich, but that is about the only time I can stand them. Everybody always talks about how great olives are … OK, great for them – for me they are too salty.I am an old man of 67, concerned about my endothelium. How can folks like me increase nitric oxide production? Would arginine help? Are there any plants high in arginine?Hello. Peanuts and peanut butter are rich in arginine. As are soybeans, whole wheat, and sunflower seeds. Beets are really recommended here and it is said that beet juice can improve nitric oxide production on the web. Garlic might be good for your endothelium, and there is an article here that walnuts are really good for the endothelium. Do you get your vitamin C and D3 (or sunshine)?Many of the recent vidoes on nutritionfacts.org are relevant to your question, I think there is a theme. Raw, unprocessed Cacao has a lot of Arginine, and while fish oil may only have a placebo effect, plant based omega 3s are very good for nitric acid production if you have an omega 3 deficiency. This would include flax seed oil or flax seeds. Niacin also has benefits and it’s hard to get enough of this nutrient from modern diets. I got this information from an internet search. They seem to be on more than one webpage. I hope this information is accurate.The famous Lyon Diet Heart Study made medical history–those on the olive-oil based diet had an unprecedented 76 percent lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease or suffering heart failure, heart attack, or stroke. This would seem to refute the impairment of arterial function.>> those on the olive-oil based dietReally, there are people on an olive oil based diet, that’s news to me, thanks for the information. ;-)People eating a traditional diet on the island of crete, as reported by Keys ins the 1960s, derived up to 40% of their calories from olive oil. That’s an olive oil based diet indeed… and a very healthy one!The Lyon Diet Heart Study administered canola oil, not olive oilThe fatty acid profile of both oils is prettys similar. Olive oil lacks the omega-3 while canol oil of course lacks the oilve polyphenols. This is why I use both oils in my kitchen.http://www.nature.com/nutd/journal/v5/n7/full/nutd201523a.html Extra virgin olive oil use is associated with improved post-prandial blood glucose and LDL cholesterol in healthy subjectsSubjects: Post-prandial glycemic and lipid profile were investigated in 25 healthy subjects who were randomly allocated in a cross-over design to a Mediterranean-type meal added with or without 10 g EVOO (first study), or Mediterranean-type meal with EVOO (10 g) or corn oil (10 g; second study). Glycemic profile, which included glucose, insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) protein and activity, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and lipid profile, which included, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C), oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C), were analyzed before and 2 h after the meal.Results: In the first study, 2 h after meal, subjects who assumed a meal with EVOO had significantly lower blood glucose (P<0.001), DPP-4 protein (P<0.001) and activity (P<0.001), LDL-C (P<0.001) and ox-LDL (P<0.001) and higher insulin (P<0.05), GLP-1 (P<0.001) and GIP (P<0.05) compared with those without EVOO. The second study showed that compared with corn oil, EVOO improved both glycemic and lipid profile. Thus, a significantly smaller increase of glucose (P<0.05), DPP4 protein (P<0.001) and activity (P<0.05) and higher increase of insulin (P<0.001) and GLP-1 (P<0.001) were observed. Furthermore, compared with corn oil, EVOO showed a significantly less increase of LDL-C (P<0.05) and ox-LDL (P<0.001).Conclusions: We report for the first time that EVOO improves post-prandial glucose and LDL-C, an effect that may account for the antiatherosclerotic effect of the Mediterranean diet.Have tried submitting a general question relating cooking oils and was rejected and instructed to post question here.Cooking oils are an important part of dietary preparation; there’s no point in trying to eat healthier if such action deteriorates the quality of life (which for many people the quality and enjoyment of food is an important measure of the quality of life).As such, it is my belief, that the NutritionFacts email response (below) to my question (below) is inappropriate as it fails to consider or recognise that good advice must be given in consideration to the environmental facts at hand (i.e. that people want to eat good food and to enjoy life) – thus the implicit advice given to cut out oils is inappropriate advice.Most dry heat cooking relies upon the use of some form of fat or oil.None of the oils listed below are derived from animal products.All of the oils have differing make ups of saturated, polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated components.Additionally other considerations should come into play when determining an appropriate cooking oil for optimum health (whilst balanced with optimum quality of life – as most individuals consider quality of food when grading quality of life).*********************************************************************************************** Aug 18, 11:05 PMWould Dr Greger please advise (general advice) upon cooking oils. What are the healthier / better recommended oils/fats with which to cook?All of my attempts at research into this topic return results heavily influenced by folk wisdom and advertising; thus prove undesirable as reliable sources of information. It would be appreciated if the discussion were reserved to the commonly available cooking oils: i.e. canola, peanut, vegetable, olive, rice bran, grape seed, sunflower oils as it is pointless to discuss relatively unobtainable oils such as, for example, walnut oil [as even if they may be healthy they are not able to be sourced].Thank youNutritional details:– As advised in his recent yearly update, 2015, olive and canola (rapeseed) oils contain trans fats resulting from processing mechanisms (and indeed these trans fats are listed on the food labelling). – His recent video (17th Aug) details some of the undesirable side effects of olive oil consumption.– All oils are fats (37KJ/g = 9Kcal/g[Cal/g]) which is a greater energy density than carbohydrates and proteins (17KJ/g = 4Kcal/g) however the body does utilise fats as an energy source in lower exertion activities and insufficient fat consumption can lead to problems.—————— Submitted from: http://nutritionfacts.org/The response received read:Thanks for your email. Dr. Greger just had a video on olive oil! Have you seen it? Basically no oil is best, as whole plant fats (where the oils are made) like avocado, olives, coconut themselves are best, which are only needed in small amounts (not so much coconut unless LDL is in good shape).I know there is so much commentary on the website. Would you mind reposting your question to the comment’s section and we can explore further? Just post it here: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/olive-oil-and-artery-function/Here is another video on shelf life of oils: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-true-shelf-life-of-cooking-oils/See if any of these help and let me know? Thanks for considering reposting***********************************************************************************************In relation to the response;It is recognised that when advising an obese patient as to their fats and oils intake to advise that no oil is good may encourage them to decrease their energy intake to that of a diet without, or with only minimal, oils. However this advice should not be recommended for most healthy individuals, for the following reasons:– The higher the daily physical exertion the more important dietary consumption of triglycerides becomes (note that it is stated in their website documentation by both the Australian and the New Zealand Institutes of Sport (each respectively) that in either of the two nations that the populations do not consume sufficient carbohydrates in their diet (the exact detail of what was considered sufficient wasn’t mentioned in what I read); the important consideration from this is that for individuals who do even a moderate level of exercise those individuals utilise fat intake to supplement energy output (obviously we are not talking about litres of oil, the discussion still rests in the realm of small quantities).– As mentioned in the paragraph above, assuming that the individual is of a healthy weight and maintains even a moderately active lifestyle the body does not and is not able to derive it’s entire daily energy requirements from carbohydrates, during periods of minimal physical exertion the body consumes greater quantities of fats (triglyceride) confer carbohydrates. Fats are sourced both from dietary fat intake and from carbohydrate storage. In the small intestine fats are emulsified and hydrolysed into triglycerides which are absorbed and stored or used by the body. We (myself and others) have been advised on multiple occasions by doctors that it is not safe (for a male) to maintain a body fat of less than roughly 17% (a female is apparently a higher percentage).The response given that “basically no oil is best” completely misses the point. The question as originally asked was not what was the oil that was “best” as meaning healthy – the question was “What are the healthier / better recommended oils/fats with which to cook?”. This question does not suggest that any oil or fat is ‘healthy’ in of itself – the response to most complex questions is “it depends”. The question was, and still remains, in the professional opinion of Dr Greger, who is a respected and learned individual in the field of nutrition, what is his general advice (i.e. non-specific – not for the treatment of any patient) regarding which are the better recommended oils/fats with which to cook when (the “it depends” part) the term ‘better’ is interpreted from the perspective of being more healthy / less potentially detrimental (note that this doesn’t suggest that the oil/fat is healthy in of itself).Thank youSome years ago, I read about a study of people ingesting vitamins (C and E perhaps?) before eating a fat-laden meal and having a different reaction in their blood vessels than the control group.Is this study still being referenced? I eat a giant salad for dinner, but I like the tablespoon of olive oil (chopped garlic + lemon juice) I add to it.Thanks!Very interesting video, thank you. I have a related question about veins and not arteries. If olive oil is not beneficial to arteries does that mean that it also has a similar effect on veins. I have a friend, who is undergoing gamma knife treatment and unfortunately the location is proximal to the jugular vein and her doctor said the treatment could compromise the integrity of the vein. She loves olive oil. Would it be better for her to avoid olive oil post treatment?veganrunnereats – mistaken identity!She can use my name! Very nice website and a fellow marathoner. Nice job veganrunnereats.com. She mentions this website.:)veganrunnereats – mistaken identity!Sorry, I just cannot buy it. It is well known that cultures that consume very high amounts of olive oil (higher than we would ever eat even if we tried) characteristically live longer. Yes there are other factors such as veggies. One of the oldest lived people (she lived to 127 I believe) said publicly that she doused everything she ate with olive oil. Endothelial function, as some of those studies not in favor of olive oil have defined it, how can we be sure correlates to a worse outcome in the real world?

One was an aunt who was obviously severely dehydrated in a nursing home. One friend had an undiagnosed melanoma lesion on her leg that her physician had said “let’s watch that” rather than “let’s immediately biopsy that.” One had a bleeding ectopic pregnancy; her doctor had sent her home for the weekend in spite of blatant high-risk symptoms. Believe-it-or-not, at the time that I was counseling her boyfriend to get her to the ER stat (whereupon they immediately took her to surgery), I was in the local hospital recovering from a hospital induced systemic staph infection that it took doctors over a week to properly diagnose and treat. I nearly died and my friend nearly died in under a week from hospital/physician error!Yes I hear you. I “died” 3 times while in the hospital after surgery from medicines I couldn’t handle and came out with diabetes and congestive heart failure which I didn’t have when I went in. My endocrinologist said “Stay out of hospitals, they make you sick”.Oh, so sorry to hear about this outcome for you! Since you’re on this website, I’m guessing you are now doing a good job of caring for your conditions.My experience has been the reverse – doctors recommending unnecessary surgeries and tests (that’s where the $$$ is). I went to 4 eye doctors and all except one recommended immediate urgent surgery in my eye (I had a black mark in it), except one. He confidently said he can tell from the color it’s a birthmark. That was more 10 years ago and the mark is still there and it never grew.Are you familiar with iridology?Is there anyway we can suggest a topic to be covered by the good Dr.? ThanksWill: You can basically post a question anywhere under a video and Dr. Greger will take note. Here is the actual wording from the FAQ section on this site, which you can go to in order to get the links if you want:“How can I get Dr. Greger to answer my question or submit an idea for future video coverage?Leave a comment under any of the videos or blog posts or post on our Facebook page or tweet us. Our (largely volunteer) social media team keeps an eye out for such requests and passes them along. You can also contact us directly. If enough people raise the same question, Dr. Greger will address it here in the FAQ, answer it in the “Ask The Doctor” section, or make a new video about it. He used to personally respond to every single comment and question raised on the site, but that’s just no longer possible.”Thanks for the feedbackJeff Novick is really good at answering questions on Facebook!What can we do about this problem? What can I do about this problem? Who do I write? How can we get activism going around this topic?Clara: All aspects of the medical industry are now dominated by money. Modern healthcare is really about health insurance, not providing improved health, as this video clearly shows. Consequently, doctors are forced through an education centered around pills and surgery, neither of which can do more than relieve symptoms, but they do insure a repeat customer for many years to come. As Bill Maher says, “there is no money in health or death, only in illness.” So, please do everything in your power to avoid coming under their influence. That is, maximize preventative measures like eating well (low fat, whole foods, vegan), getting rest and exercise, practicing stress relief, no smoking, little or no drinking. taking B12, etc, etc, like Dr G says on his web site. By the way, this message is also strongly broadcast by John McDougall, MD, and more and more other MDs. However, until such men and women doctors are common (not even close right now), we must look out for ourselves and those we love. Also as DR McD says – keep reading and studying, spread the message, voice your concerns whenever and wherever you can starting with your elected officials, and find like-minded others in your area. The ONLY way this will change is through a massive grass roots movement demanding better care of health, which the various moneyed stakeholders will fight tooth and nail. Sounds like GMO labeling, doesn’t it? Or primary education? Best wishes.Sure, there is a lot of money sloshing around, but money is not the core of the problem. Why is there so much money sloshing around in the first place? Where does it come from?Some of it is taxed, but much of it is printed or borrowed. And the only reason that can happen is because most people believe that we need to control people through the power of the state… and any time you localize power, you will attract people who get off on controlling others… and these people are not good people.If we had money that couldn’t be invented out of thin air, it would be pretty much impossible for politicians to grant favors, of which insurance, pharma, and food industry lobbyists take part.Granted, this is the world we live in, so I think (for whatever my opinion is worth) that your suggestions are absolutely on point for how to navigate our current predicament.Another good source talking about how drugs cause more problems than they solve, and showing how Big Pharma manipulates data to make their products look like they do far more than they do, is Dr Brownstein. Just Google him.Fortunate to be alive today despite a doctor’s poor medical advice: “Stay home and put your feet up” during a pregnancy in which I did not know I had placenta previa. BTW – in the second bullet point above there is no need for the apostrophe.We need competition in health care. Added regulations don’t work here any better than they did in the old Soviet Union. How about an Uber for healthcare? http://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2015/07/uber-for-health-care.htmlThe real problem is not the doctors, it’s the system that controls them. To solve this problem people must rise up and force the government, and the private sector to follow the proven system that helps people to stay heathy or be penalized. More competition in the current system will only lead to competitors to find more create ways to make more profit not guide people compassionately to health. Delivering the current bad system faster from unqualified people out of there homes is a bad idea. And silly at best. Completion has its place.Uber heathcare ;-) Nice! The good news is health care professionals who focus on nutrition and lifestyle medicine are becoming more available. It’s great to see the work of Kaiser Permanente – the largest U.S. managed care organization that publishes patient education materials. Kaiser has established a very healthful meal plan that doctors can distribute to patients. Dr. Barnard’s Medical Clinic opens this Fall in Washington, DC. A few sites have search engines for finding a doctor: Lifestyle Medicine and Dr. ​McDougall​. ​You may also want to check out the Plantrician Project.Every time I’ve been to a Dr. they seem to want to prescribe a pill of some sort before I leave… even if all my vitals are fine. I have no blood work numbers out of range on a WFPB diet and the only med I take is a rescue inhaler for asthma (I’ve had asthma since birth) but my asthma has almost gone away completely since eliminating dairy (the last thing to go before going full vegan). But still the Dr. keeps asking “what can I give you today? Are you depressed? Do you want some prozac or xanax?” ME: “No thanks doc, I feel great!”. DOC: “Are you in pain or do you need something to help you sleep?” ME: “No doc… I feel great, no pills needed”. seemed like the Dr. was put off that I didn’t want any pills. I wish nutritional intervention was offered first before pills but I don’t see that happening unless Drs get on-board with Nutritionfacts.org. There should be a law passed that all new Drs must study this site as part of internship.Another quick story… One of my best buddies I’ve known for 25 years just got his physical. He’s 44yrs old, 5’9 / 210lbs. BP=180/101, total cholesterol 240, no fasting blood sugar taken?! His Drs advice was to cut down on calories and take a BP lowering med. The med got his BP down to 130/? but he is now dizzy and has no energy. He can’t even lift a box without having to sit down right afterwards. So we went out to lunch the other day to talk about it. I took him to a Pho joint. I like to get the tofu and veggie Pho. He passed on Pho and instead ordered a chicken and egg dish smothered in a rich butter cream sauce. I said, “that’s the reason your health is not good”. He said he knew but couldn’t bring himself to change his eating habits because he loved the food he eats and was just going to take the Meds and try to eat less… *sigh… and there you have it. Some people just will not change no matter what, even in the face of declining health. The thing that gets me is he has no interest whatsoever in ANY diet. He trusts that pills will fix him all up and he can still eat McDonalds and trusts that any pill a Dr gives him is safe and effective and he has nothing to worry about.I feel that lifestyle is clicking with some health organizations, though perhaps not pushed as hard as they should. I highlighted a report my wife got and what her doctor told her in a recent video. Fairview Health Systems is the clinic. Her annual results were not great and her doctor in her talk brought up both the Mediterranean diet and the movie Forks over Knives as things she should consider. This was also printed on the report she brought home. Now my wife had heard this all from me before, and she has been eating more fruits and vegetables and we share vegan dinners about 3 times a week. But getting that reinforcement from a medical professional has really had my wife double up on her cutting back on processed foods and reducing her animal products. (Cheese will be the hardest for her) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf7oGF7kTDASee if she’ll watch dr Neal Barnard talk about why we can’t give up cheese. It’s incredible. On YouTube.Here’s a very old one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VWi6dXCT7I Could you please link to the one you’re referring to?Great video Mike! Keep up the good fight. You’re on the right side of science. We just need to get the word out to our friends and family that there is a better way. Appreciate you and your health journey.There are awesome plant based cheese recipes on Youtube and elsewhere. Miyoko Schinner has a book on vegan cheeses and even sells them ready made now. Not difficult at all and a great treat when you are feeling that yen. I TOTALLY agree that hearing about WFPB from their doctors is a huge influence because my own success was seen as a fluke by almost all until a few heard similar from an “authority” figure and not just what they considered anecdotal reports from me!yep, and we’ll be tracking down different recipes starting in September when our life calms down after a move. thanks for the reminder.Tell him that his diet will make him impotent – maybe that will help. Probably also his meds – from the side effects it sounds like a beta-blocker. Not testing his blood sugar sounds unwise.Good advice, I’ll keep working on him. I’m going to try to show him healthy Vegan options that taste great and can be substituted for the bad stuff like I do with pho. It normally comes with meat in beef broth but you can get it with veggies in veggie broth on request. Also a good veggie burger is key I think to helping some people see the light. He can’t fathom not eating a burger again. Thanks Plantstrongdoc, you’re aces brotha.Try a pizza with a whole wheat crust, BBQ sauce, lots of veggies, and ground cashews and nutritional yeast in place of the cheese (from Eng #2 book, thanks Rip!). I have family members who have no intention of giving up “real” pizza who request it when they are visiting. As for burgers, try marinating a big portobello mushroom in a balsamic/herb marinade, grill it and then put it on a cracked wheat bun cup side up with a big dollop of basil pesto and thick slices of beef steak tomato, red onion and lettuce. Who would want a greesy cheeseburger when you could have something like this!That sounds so good. Now I’m hungry, haha. Think it’s gonna be a portabello burger day today. Thanks Jim!Great suggestions, Jim! These sound deelish and very smart of you to sub in simple, familiar foods for friends new to WFPBD :) Cheers!You should’nt make him think this is a permanent decision, tell him to start with 1 day a week of no meat, gradually increasing as he gets used to more fiber in the diet and the taste, even if he has a cheat day once a week, he is much better off than eating meat on a daily basisProbably because the strong message running through everything to do with nutrition in this country is that if you don’t like the latest nutritional advice, wait a few months and it will change. I think most people have given up on getting clear effective nutritional guidance and so are just going with what they like, knowing in some vague way that it isn’t healthy. But they don’t have any confidence that any of the diets du jour will lead them to health so like your friend they continue to drill holes in the bottom of their boat and trust that doctors can patch the holes fast enough to keep them from sinking. And such a sad state of affairs is exactly what Big Food wants, “nobody really knows, nothing is really certain, there are so many conflicting studies, here, have another one of our delicious new desserts, it will make you feel better!”You hit the nail on the head Jim. There is so much confusing health advice out there right now that people don’t know who to believe anymore. Worse than that there are sites and bloggers who actively appose a WFPB diet for whatever reason and will attack it whenever possible with lies and myths usually for self validation of their own strongly held belief system. Thankfully Nutritionfacts.org is a port in the storm for those seeking the truth.Unfortunately, you are spot on.The whole system works together. If you practice medicine any other way, and something bad happens they can sue you for not following the accepted treatment and win. This system is about control and money, just like the farming system, and any other corporate national or global system. People do not fit in except as entities that can be a controlled source of profit.Merchants of doubt, that is their product. All you need to think is there is a mere possibility it might be good for you or even that it might not be bad.A few years ago I took an intensive nutrition course. I’d been interested and reading about nutrition for over 40 years. One of the most rewarding parts of the course was discovering others who felt the way I did about taking charge of our own health and doing so with nutrition. But our numbers are growing…The Us healthcare is full of intermediaries and CYA policies. It is based on an economic purpose that seeks to maximize profit by exploiting insurance and number of treatments. From that point of view, it makes sense that the US healthcare is the most expensive and inefficient of the world. It prefers treatments (maximize returns) not successes (minimize returns). Treating makes more economical sense than curing. Bloating the system with services makes sense to the shareholders because it brings more profits by moving more money. Profits are rewarded and encourage. Sick people bring profit. If nobody went to hospitals to receive treatments, doctors pay would be proportionally reduced affecting the supporting, managing, owning staff plus the banks. How distant is the banking industry from the healthcare industry? Banks and business seat on top of the US pyramid. They tell you what how it is. And your job is to conform.Such a traveshamockery…great post Dr. Gregor! So sorry to hear we lost such a force in medicine. Good to know clotting genetics too….we test for that and have changed more than a few patients meds because of it. Recently had a family member with cancer admitted to hospital to manage pain and contracted pneumonia. Pain was eventually easily managed at home by an amazing friend and MD who practices guess what…pain management. NO hospitalization required. Pneumonia(and icky biopsy) could have been avoided.My son is in his third year of residency in internal medicine. He will be a great doctor his dad thinks. One of his complaints that I hear often is about the 30 hour rotations without a break. No nap. Coming home the other day he heard a car honking at him. He was at a stop light asleep. I worry about him. I worry about those on the road with him. And certainly I would not want to be a patient at about hour 26 of his schedule. No many or us would be at our best at that point. To think of a complicated patient in the hands of someone with that cognitive skill at that point is sad. It is really inexcusable.Is it part of a mind-control strategy where they wear them down so they will be more pliable and accepting of the sick care model?Its horrible they do that. I had one intern sew up my daughter’s cut without waiting for the medicine that numbs the wound to take effect because he wanted to go back to sleep. At the time I was so brainwashed and naive about doctors, I did nothing but almost faint and have lived with the guilt ever since. I don’t know why hospitals or whoever makes the rules feels it is o.k. to do this to interns but something should be done about it. The “reform” they instituted is way too little and waay too late. And the statistics Dr. Greger stated are most likely under-stated. I personally know of one person killed by being given the wrong medicine and it was just swept under the rug. Nothing happened to the nursing student who killed this person – nothing at all.Firefighters around here do 24-hours shifts WITH A BED, and then 48 hours OFF. Ridiculous is 30 on, absolutely moronic. I should have gotten an MD when instead of the JD I now have no use for. Water, bridge, under…A neighbor’s son, who had a good life with a wife he loved and a daughter he adored, went three nights in a row with little or no sleep because of worries about his job. Then he jumped off a freeway bridge. You cannot expect people to be able to function and think when they are exhausted from lack of sleep.Hello. Could you please add footnotes for the sources in your transcript? I have mentioned Nutritionfacts.org to several people to show them why eating a whole food plant-based diet is healthier but sometimes it takes a lot of time to find the right article to ascertain the sources. Thanks!Just click on the Sources Cited button to the right of the video. Thanks for sharing my work!What I mean is: could you put footnotes in the transcript to point to the articles in “Sources”? For instance, there are 13 articles in “Sources” and, if I wanted to show anybody which is the right one so they can check it themselves, I’d have to theoretically go though all 13 of them.On another note, Dr. Greger, I really hope to see you this Fall in Montreal at the second Montreal Vegan Festival!Hey Sebastian. I see what you are saying, but please understand to add all of those links would require another large step of including the proper hyperlinks for each study for every transcript published. We can look into doing that in the future it’s actually a great idea, however, currently our staff is very limited and have so much to edit already. In the videos, Dr. Greger is always pulling up the study for you to see and talking about its strong points. Sure, you’d have to pay close attention and match up the citation, but for avid readers super intrigued I am sure they could find it, no? If there is ever something that I can help look up let me know. As you’ve probably seen all blogs have hyperlinks and many reflect studies in the videos so you could perhaps recommend the blogs over videos in some cases. Just my thoughts.. Stay tuned for more improvements and keep the suggestions coming! I, too, hope you get to catch the good doctor in Montreal.Best, JosephOh, I see. That’s what the blogs are for. All the videos are made into blogs with all the studies hyperlinked to the transcript. Hope that helps!Joseph, Dr. Greger, thank you for replying. I was not aware about the difficulties of adding hyperlinks or the fact that blogs contained hyperlinks. Nevertheless, I was thinking more about citations. If you want, I can volunteer to add some myself. Just have someone from your staff contact me, tell me which style you use (APA, MLA, etc.) and I’ll gladly help. Thanks for all your amazing job!Awesome! Check in with us about volunteering! Just shoot us a quick volunteer application so we know what time you have available.Thanks so much,JosephHeart disease being 96% avoidable seems pretty good- but just in women, and how? What about the other 4% and is it avoidable or are they doomed by their genes? Also, what percentage is avoidable in men, and how? I tried searching for this and found articles that recommended eating lean meat and milk and limiting instead of restricting alcohol. No Thanks!I think 96% for men and women appears to me to be very conservative. Check out this video from this site: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/ . Here a study was done in the 1960s to compare the evidence of heart attack at autopsy in 632 Ugandans as compared to 632 Missourans of African descent. In the Ugandans, 1 small healed infarct (meaning it wasn’t the cause of death) or 0.2% while in the folks from St. Louis there were 136 or 21.5% with signs of heart attack, with heart attack being the cause of death in many of them. With such astonishing results, the researchers went on to look at another 795 autopsies of Ugandans and still only the one small heart attack out of 1427. So if you were a Ugandan in the 1960 eating very close to a whole food plant based diet, then your odds of having a heart attack was 1 out of 1427 or 0.07%. So with a lifetime of eating the same plant based diet that the Ugandans were eating I think 96% avoidance for both men and women look like a very easy target and an nearly 100% elimination of heart attacks looks very doable.But 100% is probably only doable for our children if we can stop the dietary abuse in time. For the rest of us, we can still get the odds of a first heart attack way down. Even something like 96% or better is probably possible, taking Dr. Esselstyn’s initial and follow-up clinical trial as evidence. But to really get rid of it we have to help the children break the cycle.InterestingIs there a respected guide to rational levels of medical surveillance for those of us with healthy lifestyles and no symptoms, now that we know annual physicals, colonoscopies, prostate screening, and mammograms have limited utility?Darryl: This is the question of the year! Thanks for your post and for the links too. Whether there is an answer or not, the question is revealing and something for us all to think about.Great question, Darryl. I think some physician practices are actively figuring this out, although I haven’t found any guidelines published for us laypersons. Atul Gawande has an excellent article in The New Yorker (“Overkill,” May 11,2015) on negative consequences of over testing http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/overkill-atul-gawande In his article Gawande describes how the WellMed patient care model eliminates unnecessary care and unnecessary testing in order to provide more necessary care, thus improving patient outcomes. Healthwise.org may be a move in this direction of helping people decide what and when to test and what the results suggest. Their their long running book, “Healthwise Handbook: Take Charge of Your Health” and associated web-accessible supplements, are used by major health care insurers including Kaiser Permanente. I have not read this book or used used Healthwise services.The only acceptation (for me) is that I had cancerous polyps discovered and removed from my colonoscopy in 2009, so I am ok with a colonoscopy and will be getting another one again for peace of mind.You know the body can destroy cancer by itself if given the proper “tools” (diet), don’t you? Not saying 100% of course but we all have cancer every day and it goes away by itself. I have become so very suspicious of today’s doctors that I would question whether the so-called cancerous polyps were actually cancerous. It seems a bit suspicious to me that almost everyone that gets a colonoscopy has found these cancerous polyps yet people like me who do not get the tests just continue along being fine.Veggie Eric, good to hear your colonoscopy went well. If you feel comfortable doing so, would you please consider sharing with us whether or not the polyps that were removed were within reach of a flexible sigmoidoscope (i.e., distal colon, last two feet)? Although recently offered a colonoscopy, I am about to acquiesce to a one-time flexible sigmoidoscopy in accordance with Dr. McDougall’s recommendations from 2010. I had to convince my ‘Primary’ to go this route and I see that I will also have to make this case to the ‘gastro’ whose office assumed I was coming for a colonoscopy, but will instead submit only to the sig-scope. Dr. McDougall’s recommendations are here: https://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2010nl/aug/colon.htm Thanks.Hi Lawrence, I wish I had that information. It would probably be helpful as I don’t know the exact location within the colon where the polyps were removed… But the procedure was painless and quick. They put me into a twilight sleep with Michael Jacksons favorite sleepytime drug propofol. Next thing ya know the Dr was sitting me up and showing me pictures of my colon. I was glad I had a full colonoscopy done so I could see what was going on over in the ascending colon and apendix area. For me I would do the full colonoscopy for peace of mind, but that’s just my opinion.Pam Popper is surely against routine screenings and tests. I’m not sure if she recommends any ever without some reason for inquiry.Off Topic: I just read an news article saying that experimental results show that transforming growth factor beta-1 is a major cause of aging and cognitive decline- at least in mice, and that it’s reversible with a chemotherapy agent: http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/uoc–dpu051215.phpIs there a nutritional equivalent for this drug?Maybe our old friend (and Dr. Greger’s favorite) curcumin.Thanks for your response, Darryl. Without it, I might be tempted to experiment on myself with galunisertib-if I could find it. Instead, I’ll continue to take turmeric. Please keep us posted on any new developments in this area.I am a whole foods plant-based vegan, but my family with whom I live (daughter, son in law, kids ages 26 and 22) are junk food omnivores. The 22 yo is going to Medical school next year. I can’t convince him or any of the family to do some basic research about the benefits of a plant based lifestyle. I have forwarded Dr Greger’s NutritionFacts and other info, to no avail. They just delete the messages. I could just cry, I feel so frustrated. I can’t afford to move out. Is it worth my time to keep trying? My daughter and son in law are both on several prescription drugs which I am sure could be eliminated with lifestyle changes. It just hurts me so much to watch them destroy their lives. Any suggestions?Sadie, I think many of us know how extremely painful and frustrating it can be to watch loved ones ignoring health information while slowly killing themselves with poor diet and lifestyle choices. My advice: 1) Be respectful of your loved ones and their right to make their own choices 2) Don’t lecture or be pushy 3) Keep quiet until it’s the right moment and keep it very brief and to to point, as well as upbeat and loving 4) Lead by example. Truly enjoy your healthy lifestyle. Maybe try some new delicious recipes and advertise how yummy it tastes.After making some serious efforts it is probably best to just ask yourself in what ways can you continue to improve your own life in meaningful ways instead of wearing yourself down trying to fight mass insanity? I know…I know…all the guilt from not trying to save the world….oh the pain….. In actuality…this kind of guilt-trip likely derives from a lower level of understanding if anything. It’s easy to be simple-minded…it’s much harder to rise above this and accept some realities.Never give up! It took my mother at least ten years of persistent nudging. Emails,books,articles, comments and dealing health before I finally listened. We’re very grateful to her now for her persistence. It’s a marathon not a sprint! Also, thumbs up to Daryl’s contributions. :-)I have the same experience with friends. At first, when I forwarded videos, they wouldn’t watch but acknowledge. They don’t even do that any more. Frustrating.In my experience, almost every person who went to Medical School, was doing it to become Rich or simply to Please their Parents! Medical School was a Get Rich Quick Scheme ! Is there any wonder that most MDs’ end up as Alcoholics or (Legal) Drug Addicts!Are doctors paid a fixed annual salary , as most of us are, or a portion of the profits based on the number of patient visits to each doctor?While I am not a fan of modern medicine, your statements are a bit on the far out side. I am sure there are well intentioned doctors who truly want to help people but their education has failed them miserably. Apparently it has also taught them to close their minds to anything “new”, which is really sad. I remember that I suffered with ulcers caused by h. pylori for 10 years while a lone doctor tried to convince his cohorts of what actually caused ulcers (not stress and spicy food). Finally I found a doctor who had taken the doctor’s discovery to heart and he cured me. Bless him and bless the doctor that spread the word.agree. My brother is a Doctor whom ran his own practice and who is very intelligent and cared for his patients, however, the insurance companies forced him out-of-business and into a clinic run by business people. Now he works for a pay check only and keeps his “nose clean” it’s sad. Only works to retire. The real problem is not the doctors, it’s the system that controls them. To solve this problem people must rise up and force the government, and the private sector to follow the proven system that helps people to stay heathy or be penalized. More competition in the current system will only lead to competitors to find more create ways to make more profit not guide people compassionately to health.I’m sure you are right about the system, just not sure it is the responsibility of “the people” or government to clean it up. Nor do I think it is possible. I think the doctors themselves must fix their system somehow. I know some have tried to opt out of taking insurance and I don’t think that worked for them. Perhaps they need to join something other than the AMA which has somehow gained way too much power. Perhaps Physicians for Responsible Medicine? Maybe start their own insurance company? Why not?I’ve have a much different experience of people I know who are doctors and the reasons why they went to med school. I think it’s fair to say everyone has problems, but let’s not blame all the doctors. I know that is not what you implied. Surely this is a complex issue. The cool thing is that Dr. Greger is humble enough to recognize the faults in his own profession and with that knowledge admit the mistakes and look for ways to facilitate change.Did you know that the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom for many years the highest mortality from lung cancer in the world have and that the mortality from breast cancer and prostate cancer also very high compared to other countries are? More information: http://www.preventingcancer.infoTwo comments.First, I think in actuality doctors have become THE leading cause of death, not the third leading cause, even leaving out deaths due to medical errors and incompetence. Let’s look at the nominal first and second leading causes of death on the list, heart disease and cancer. The fact that the doctors focus almost entirely on drugs, surgery, etc. after their patients reach a treatment stage, rather than on prevention, which might prevent as many as >75% of those people from ever getting the disease in the first place, puts those deaths squarely at the door of the doctors who failed to make at least a reasonable effort to inform, convince, and properly support their patients on the value of preventative health practices. Make me wonder what ever happened to doctors swearing to abide by the Hippocratic oath, and “I will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgement and never do harm to anyone. To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death. ” These days, the Hypocritical oath seems more like it.In addition, the treatment modalities for heart disease and cancer for those who actually have developed detectable disease, actually seem ineffective for the majority of patients even when compared to patients who do nothing (http://www.clinmed.rcpjournal.org/content/2/6/527.full.pdf+html http://www.icnr.com/articles/ischemotherapyeffective.html ), and outrageously ineffective when compared to people who choose to make lifestyle changes instead , as for example when looking at people who diligently follow the Esseltyn diet. (http://dresselstyn.com/JFP_06307_Article1.pdf)Second, in looking online at the official lists of the leading causes of death, like the CDC’s, ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm ) I note the conspicuous absence of any mention of deaths do to the medical industry at all, blatantly choosing to just leave the data out. This really does go well beyond a conspiracy of silence into Orwellian territory.Incidentally, as a friend pointed out, I agree that it doesn’t all the doctors fault, but doctors do serve as the proximate cause of those deaths, as licensed agents of that medical system. And even the medical system doesn’t accomplish all this on its own, but in combination with the Food Industry, aided, abetted, and institutionalized by the contrary to scientific fact policies adopted by the U.S. Government. All of these together comprise the real leading cause of death in the U.S.,And as Stan Lee said, “With great power comes great responsibility.” For the most part doctors have abrogated that responsibility, despite their ethical and moral to take that responsibility:“I will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone. To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death. ”How has this happened? I think Edmund Burke summed it up well:“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”I don’t see doctors as a evil, or at least any more evil or more corrupt than other human beings, but they do hold the power of life and death over their patients, which means I believe they they have to answer to a higher standard.Many do indeed seem good human beings with good intentions, but in my experience the vast majority of them, with the exception of a few like Ornish Esseltyn, and Greger, in the final analysis they end up as “good men who do nothing.” We need to inspire more “good M.D.s” in the system to become “good men who do something.” I feel happy to see more a few M.D.s of that kind posting here.Better: A Surgeon’s Notes on Performance by Atul Gawande … great book, brilliant author.As always, highly informative and excellently articulated. Thank you!I live in the coastal city of Santa Cruz, CA and several people I know, myself included are wondering if the Fukishima plant’s meltdown’s continuing radioactive water leakage into the Pacific is slowly killing the ocean? Secondly, is it contaminating so much of the Pacific that it poses a hazard to even go into it on the west coast of the U.S. for fear of accumulating a lethal dose of radiation. Its my understanding radioactive exposure is cumulative, is that correct? Third, if the ocean is slowly but continuously being contaminated by this radioactive leakage, what effect is it having on fish and will it (or is it currently?) be safe to eat any ocean fish or will we have to take a Geiger counter to the fish monger to check before we buy? Extremely concerned. Thanks AGDr Greger did a video on Fukishima.http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/There is a very good book called “Physics For Future Presidents” that cuts through all the BS on radiation and explains how it works and the experimental statistical findings about radiation. Fukushima is pretty bad, but I think by the time radiation gets to the west coast of the US is background radiation. Instead of imagining the worst, read about radiation from reputably sources.AG: re: “myself included are wondering if the Fukishima plant’s meltdown’s continuing radioactive water leakage into the Pacific is slowly killing the ocean?” From my perspective, the question is not relevant, because humans are quickly killing the oceans another way. If you are interested in saving the oceans, I recommend doing some research on ‘dead zones’. Here’s some links to get you started: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_%28ecology%29 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-hanlon/dead-zones-now-in-more-fr_b_833025.htmlAlso, human slavery is rampant on the fishing vessels that bring us fish. I’ve read an in depth article on this topic and the brutality is horrifying. Who wants to be part of that? I can’t find the specific article, but there is plenty of information out there with a simple search. Here is are some links to get you started. You can see in the second link that eating farmed fish does nothing to protect the oceans since the farms are feeding ocean fish to the farmed fish… http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25814718 http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/-sp-migrant-workers-new-life-enslaved-thai-fishingMy take-home is: Ideally people would not be buying any fish at all regardless of what is happening with Fukishima. ie, that Fukishima is the least of our problems.Thanks for the video and all the wonderful comments. experienced my own share of medical misjudgment, but I ask lots of questions and have avoided the worst. As for plant based medicine, the truth will out, we’re just not at the tipping point yet. Best to you all.“Is it part of a mind-control strategy where they wear them down so they will be more pliable and accepting of the sick care model?” Great observation. You may be right.I have told you many times that I have discovered the cause of most cancers and you have never contacted me at delparkinson@msn.com or called me 360-438-3636 so I know the feeling. Del.Hey Del, I went and looked at one of your videos. Interesting but you are going to need some clinical data, some research, some real correlations to make a good argument. I posted on the video I watched as well. Thanks for sharing your theories, but I cannot agree (i gave a very light touching on my experience in the RF field in the comment).Your point is well made, prevention is better than treatment. In fairness to doctors, people turn up in hospital after screwing up their bodies then look for the so called medical miracles we associate with drugs like antibiotics. Simple advice like go home, eat your veggies and get some exercise are not seen as being real medicine. Practical low cost common sense things are ignored in favour of extraordinary interventions.Having said all that, I also get the point that the medical profession seems locked into a mind set which pretty much ensures making mistakes. The oft quoted phrase “first do no harm” seems very hollow and meaningless when used in the face of the obvious harm being done daily.This issue is complicated but to enter a few thoughts on quality improvement as a graduate of the Advanced Training Program at Intermountain Healthcare. The IOM’s reports,Crossing the Quality Chasm and To Err is Human pointed to the large number of preventable deaths caused by errors. The quality improvement movement in medicine which took off in the 1980’s with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and the work of Brent James and his colleagues at Intermountain Healthcare was based on the work of Dr. Deming who helped launch the quality movement in Japan post WWII. This approach to problem solving… front line teams working collaboratively to solve problems based on statistical process control is supposed to be taught in residencies but isn’t. And even if it was taught if health care professionals get out of residencies and go to work in systems (whether they are large or small) that don’t support the “effective” application of these techniques it won’t happen. Intermountain Healthcare has implemented quality improvement guidelines in over 80% of clinical work. They have held cost increases to CPI plus 1% over the last two years. You will know prevention and quality are happening in your medical care organization when the health of plan members go up and rates go down. The bad news this will take time and may never happen except in a few medical organizations. The good news is by individuals following good lifestyle practices… WFPB diet, exercise, non smoking while pushing for policies that support improved public health issues such as clean air and water you can avoid drugs and procedures. The best way to prevent a problem with a medication or procedure is to not have one in the first place. Now don’t get me wrong there is certainly a place for medications and surgery but best avoided. As greater numbers of folks improve their own lifestyle they will influence others to change as well.Great comment as usual. Please use paragraphs for my old eyes : )I took my husband to the doctor because his blood pressure was high 160/90–immediately he wanted to give him this blood pressure pill and when I asked can we do this naturally he said no way he is going to have to take this for the rest of his life. And he neglected to tell us that this small pill one of the side effects if impairment to the kidneys. He mentioned nothing about nutrition, magnesium levels, lifestyle, stress, nothing. So went home goggled the side effects decided he wasn’t going to do that and started a program of my own with supplements that help with this as well as some diet changes. We also did acupuncture. Within 3 weeks his blood pressure was 110/76. The doctor refused to talk about natural methods, told us it would never work, told us he would have to take this blood pressure medicine for the rest of his life—does he get a kickback on these prescriptions? Well never filled it and have never looked back and my husband is doing great!This is the kind of shit that gives the whole medical profession a bad name. Sorry for my language, but that’s what it is. Total bullshit.VERY HAPPY that you knew enough/learned enough to approach the issue with nutrition and got safe, quick, and everlasting results without complications–but probably only enhanced longevity and wellness from the dietary changes. KUDOS!!!How frustrating :-( Of course medications have their place, but certainly there are dietary steps to take for hypertension. The DASH diet comes to mind and doctor’s need to be able to recommend aspects of this diet! I am so glad you found relief.Best, JosephI like your programs very much but you have ignored progress by many medical groups.

Thanks for mentioning. Here is a video on Kaiser Permanente – the largest U.S. managed care organization that publishes patient education materials.

I sure hope not and should not have to. I am vegan and pretty much been that way for 24 years. I do not remember the last time i had a cold or flu or anything else. It is the Genesis 1:29 diet. Also i have good insurance found in Exodus 15:26 –15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I [am] the LORD that healeth thee.There are no godsNo gods, Just One God!!!!>> I do not remember the last time i had a cold or flu or anything else.Maybe you have Alzheimer’s. Seriously, we cannot go or listen to what people say about what personally think they eat, or experience, or how well or sick they are … that’s why we have science.Hi Brux – You listen to science and i will follow the directions of my Creator, the One who designed us humans knows what is for our best good !!!!Leviticus 7:22-27. To look at us now is to understand how far we have strayed. Say Amen.Hi Lawrence – Yes i can say Amen to that. The people in the world would all be healthy if we followed our Creator and Designer.Matthew 6:5-8This reminds me of the story of the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis.Dr. Semmelweis worked at the Vienna General Hospital’s maternity clinic. In European and North American hospitals, puerperal fever, or childbed fever, was rampant, sometimes climbing to 40 percent of admitted patients. He developed a theory of infection, in which he theorized that decaying matter on the hands of doctors, who had recently conducted autopsies, was brought into contact with the genitals of birth giving women during the medical examinations at the maternity clinic. He proposed a radical hand washing theory using chlorinated lime, now a known disinfectant.Implementing his theory reduced his department’s death rate by 90%. Has the medical establishment followed his way? Dr. Gereger’s video will give you a hint to the correct answer. It is to do with the human nature more than the medicine.His story is even more compelling when you realize what happened to him! I tell the story in What about Semmelweis and medicine’s shameful handwashing history?.The “Medical Establishment” seems to treat doctors in training as if they were indentured servants: cheap, exploitable labor. There should be a law limiting the hours worked to perhaps 50 hours, with adequate sleep an absolute requirement. The present situation is medieval, worthy of a lampoon by Monty Python if it weren’t so serious.…the doctors and hospitals kill you very slowly by exaggerating the least abnormality, scaring you to death to make you pay for unnecessary tests and then require surgery & lifelong drugs. You are better off dying naturally, you will live longer and keep your money from charlatan thieves.Dear Dr Greger and Commenters,I am sorry to hear that you had negative experiences with healthcare. So did I, and I am WFPB physician, but despite that, I urge you to dig a little deeper before you make such statements as we heard in this video. The Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education is working hard correcting this problem with initiatives that completely changed residency programs and the teaching institutions focus (just an example): http://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/tabid/436/ProgramandInstitutionalAccreditation/NextAccreditationSystem/ClinicalLearningEnvironmentReviewProgram.aspx.How could you believe that anyone can work under the influence of drugs or alcohol, especially physicians? There is mandatory drug and alcohol testing for both residents and attending physicians in the hospital and there are anonymous routes to report someone who might still dare to show up to work under the influence (which I have personally never experienced). Any patient safety issue can be anonymously reported and is very seriously investigated in the hospital. Our residents meet with the faculty monthly to discuss new patient safety and quality improvement initiatives, everyone brings ideas and works on a small local or interdepartmental project. I am not doubting the data that mistakes happen, but stating that we do nothing about it is the exact opposite of the truth. We have been working hard to bring valuable change, and I hope that you will see results soon. Wish you all the best. Eat well, live well!I didn’t hear anything about actually working under the influence, what I heard was working at the levels of sleep deprivation that equate the functional impairment of being under the influence. Maybe I should re-view the vid?I wish you great success at turning the tide from SAD/managment to WFPB/thriving. Thanks for commenting.Upton Sinclair said it all: “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”My sense is that food in the grocery stores and restaurants of America is our greatest national threat. How many have died needlessly of heart disease, diabetes complications, cancer, all of which can be prevented or ameliorated through diet. This is far more dangerous than even doctors and hospitals!brilliant! thanks Rebecca.Having served on the medical executive committees of two hospitals, I can offer some good news as to the latest efforts of two community hospitals in Oregon, and hope that they are representative of the efforts of similar hospitals around the country. For instance, we measure the rate of hand washing by health care providers and post the results in order to reduce the spread of infections, and use checklists before surgeries to insure patients receive prophylactic antibiotics. Both preventative efforts have reduced the rate of nosocomial infections. Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE), used by both hospitals, has decreased the rate of medication errors. There are active programs to reduce falls by hospitalized patients. I could go on, but my point is that both for the safety of patients, and maintenance of accreditation and reputation of the hospitals, I foresee physician error dropping a notch or two on the list of common causes of death, and hope that one day it falls off the Top 15 list.https://youtu.be/eSOWPYpdfO0The book, ” Medicines that Kill” by JMarcum MD FACC is an excellent resource. This book has great statistics and insights from a practicing MDAnother thing they are resisting is the computerization of the medical record in Dr. Weed’s S.O.A.P. format with auditing by diagnostic and statistical quality control programs.

Some are good and devoted while others are greedy for money and very sloppy with a diagnoses. Drugs are easy and more drugs are handed out to counter the negative reaction to a drug with more dispensed with each reaction. Use food as a medicine, amazing results.Yes I always wondered what doctor’s performance was like seeing that they work ‘long exhausting shifts’….excellent discussion/video!This could be an interesting topic to cover, if any study as been done on it: What’s served in the Hospitals around the world – http://www.realfarmacy.com/20-eye-opening-photos-of-hospital-food-from-around-the-world/Hi Dr. Greger. The research this video is based on data from 2000. Are the same numbers from the article still valid today? I wrote an article based on your video and someone asked if the numbers are the same in 2015. I have no doubt they are, or might be worst, but are there any current articles that address the number of deaths? Thank youLet’s not forget the outright psychopaths and sadists that prowl the obstetrical/pediatric wards and the psych wards, and how many of their activities are actually institutionalized in standardized medical practice endorsed by their respective guilds. Circumcision, premature cord clamping, episiotomy, back birthing, routine induction and cesarian, hyper-vaccination, mother-baby isolation, lack of support (or outright sabotage) for breast feeding. And for the shrinks, toxic drugs, manufactured diseases, conjured chemical imbalances, implicit support of abusive family situations and social/economic ills, dungeons of quackery and last but certainly not least, shock treatment.Let’s put the label where it belongs: american medicine is sick.

Been avoiding it completely. Good to know I can use it to thicken up some of my salads. :-)I was thinking. The original video you did said that avocado acted like chemo. So it would indeed reduce cancer… but would it not also compromise your immune system. The study said it prevented prostate cancer but did it do this by damaging the immune system like was said in the original video?I mean does this study prove that it is not a danger in other immune system problems, and other cancers?Same here. I remember the video saying that it in-vitro tests showed it blew DNA to pieces. I’d love to start eating it again, especially since I’m at increased risk of prostate cancer.It was because they used the leaves and they have a toxin humans do not cosume th leaves.leaves AND fruit were cited, both causing the same results.Does anyone have any idea why “men with high linolenic acid proportions were at increased likelihood of PCa?” As an omega-3 fatty acid, isn’t linolenic acid a good thing?The “Results” section of the abstract at the “study” link above states: “high linolenic acid proportions were at increased likelihood of PCa [prostate cancer]”. But there are two forms of linolenic acid, a-linolenic which is n-3 (omega 3) and y-linolenic which is n-6 (omega 6). So, wouldn’t it make a difference which subtype is associated. Given the typical American diet, which is low in n-3 and too high in n-6, I’m wondering if these results don’t need further differentiation. But I’m posing this more as a question than an answer. I know very little about this, and I have your same a question, but the n-3, n-6 might be part of it.Ok ! But i am confuse should we eat or not ?!?!Ho did it go? Are there any more studies suggesting avocados are bad for us, or and research proving them to be fine to eat?

I add the turmeric to the flaxseed oil because turmeric is fat soluble, and because, as I understand it, turmeric does not survive in the upper digestive acids. By mixing turmeric in a healthy fat, I’m hoping the turmeric will make it to my lower digestive system where fats are digested and improve the bioavailability of the curcumin/turmeric. Do you think my theory holds water?Thanks, Matt M of Boston.It is best to avoid including added fats in the form of empty calories into our diet, as most of the benefit from the whole food is lost.This 2 year study looked at coronary artery lesions of the heart after consuming different types of fat. Polyunsaturated fat (what makes up flaxseed oil) Monounsaturated fat (75% of which makes up olive oil) and Saturated fat (the kind found in mostly animal products). They looked at angiograms a year apart after intervening with increasing one type of fat in each group. All 3 fats were associated with a significant increase in new atherosclerosis lesions. Most importantly, the growth of these lesions did not stop when polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats were substituted for saturated fats. Only by decreasing all fat intake including the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats did the lesions stop growing.http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/263/12/1646.abstract?sid=47d1d016-3c15-43f4-a013-0d10144ef8e3Dear Toxins,Thank you for the information, however, the addition of flaxseed oil to my breakfast smoothie (forgot to mention I add it to a fruit and veggie smoothie) is not on top of other fats. On any given day, I eat, almost exactly, the FDA recommended daily allowance of fat. I’ve eaten almost exclusively vegan for months now, so my sources of fats have been nuts, seeds, avocados, peanuts, extra virgin olive oil and flax seed oil. Although, I’m not perfect, I hover around the FDA daily limit on fats.Within that fat limit, I add turmeric and pepper to flaxseed oil in order to increase the bioavailability of the turmeric. (Curcumin) Hopefully, my fat intake is healthy. I am certainly concerned about atherosclerosis, but for this question in particular, I am hoping to learn about the bioavailability of turmeric/curcumin. My understanding is that turmeric does not survive in the upper digestive track, so taking a turmeric supplement without an enteric coating is nearly useless. I want the benefits that turmeric has to offer, but I can’t find an enteric coated turmeric pill on the market, so… I began problem solving. Turmeric, pepper and flaxseed oil is what I’ve been experimenting with. Again, my theory is that the flax seed oil/fat will help more of the fat soluble turmeric make it to my lower digestive system where it can be absorbed properly. Do you think this theory holds water?Again, thanks for the info.Regards, Matt M…Look at the USDA Daily values for fats as limits, not as required percentages to achieve. The only fat you need is omega 3 and 6. You only need 1.6 grams of omega 3 and 6. This would register at 4-5% of the USDA DV for total fat. All other fats are produced by your body and eating saturated fats is harmful. I have not heard any science regarding your turmeric theory, nor would i assume that turmeric is destroyed in the upper intestines. If your trying to increase the bioavailibilty of antioxidants, then sprinkling a few seeds or nuts on your food would be more then sufficient.Sorry, but your responses to Matt M’s questions are very poor indeed.I think what your doing by mixing turmeric with black pepper is great, taking it with flaxseed oil is also a good idea.. as to wether the turmeric will make it to the lower GI is debatable, however I wouldn’t worry about that so much when you add black pepper to the mix. Also you don’t want to make the mix too viable as there could be an issue with minor toxicity.. I’d say keep doing what your doingI read a lot of research articles that say curcumin is not very bioavailable. Aren’t we wasting our time on something that does not even get absorbed? Why so many articles?Together with turmeric (curcumin) and Black pepper (piperine) may increase the bioavailability of curcumin up to 2,000% or 20 times.2,000% is very bioavailable.By watching your videos I could learn how important it is to load our body with huge amounts of antioxidants, specially in the morning.However, how much of it is absorbed by the body and how much wind out into the toilet?",['-'],-,-,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/06/28/fighting-inflammation-with-food-synergy/,-,-,"http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-ok-if-blood-pressure-is-ok/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22258268,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9619120,"

But, freezing the veggies or fruit should not matter.Can diet help with PAH(pulmonary artery hypertension)? Do you know of any natural treatments? Thank-you! Tina@beccadoggie10 thank you for the blanching times, I live in San Diego, California, so I have to problem getting fresh fruits and veggies all year-round, yet I love blanching veggies, but I am not always sure about the times. I also find hard to find organic blueberries, and blackberries in near-by grocery stores, unless they are frozen, I am thankful for this post Dr. Greger, as for many others. Your website has literally saved my life, thank you!Dr Greger,I came across the study where was said that non organic berries have high level of pesticides and herbicides, sounded that it is not worth to consume non organic berries .How unsafe are non organic berriesAlso wanted to hear your opinion on GMO produceThank youVladVlad, Great question. Dr. Greger has two relevant older videos that discuss the benefits of eating organic foods: Can pesticides be rinsed off? (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-pesticides-be-rinsed-off/) and Cancer Fighting Berries (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-fighting-berries-2/). A recent video encouraged us all to rinse even our organic produce since it could be contaminated with fecal bacteria: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/norovirus-food-poisoning-from-pesticides/.Regarding GMOs, Dr. Greger answered another reader’s question on the issue here: http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/gmos-and-decreased-nutrition-in-our-foods/ .Hope that helps!I fucking hate STRAWBERRIES!!!!!!!!!I’ve seen many studies on how bad whole eggs are -but what about organic egg whites?drew4021: One of the more memorable lines from Dr. Barnard’s book on Preventing and Reversing Diabetes is, “There are just two problems with eggs: the yolk and the white.” So, what’s the problem with the white? Dr. Barnard talks about the problems that animal protein presents for kidney health. Other experts talk about the (strong in my opinion) link between animal protein and cancer. The question scientists then want to answer is: Is there a causal link? If so, what is the mechanism by which animal protein might cause cancer?If memory serves, Dr Campbell in The China Study mentions several ways in which we think that animal protein causes and promotes cancer. Here on NutritionFacts, you can get a great education on how animal protein is linked to the body’s over-production of a growth hormone called IGF-1. IGF-1 helps cancer to grow. To watch the series about IGF-1, click on the link below and then keep clicking the “next video” link on the button to the right until you get through the bodybuilding video. Then you will have seen the entire series. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/With all of the information we have about the harmful effects of animal protein, I think it’s best to stay away from egg white. Why not get your protein from safe sources? Sources which are known to have lots of positive health effects and will naturally give you a balanced amount of protein? (ie: whole plant foods) Make sense?",['-'],-,-,-,-,"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/greens/","http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20528581,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12188629,"

Regarding the oxalates in cinnamon, are there any oxalate dangers in eating Ceylon cinnamon?I love how you can take a boring vegetable or bean, add the right mix of spices, and suddenly it becomes a delicious dish that everyone gobbles down.Very thought provoking research you’ve given us today. 2000% boost in bioavailability concerns as it might relate to how it effects other bodily functions in maybe a harmful way.I have a concern about the iodine that is added to regular salt. Does this synthetic form of iodine have any negative science behind it as far as not being healthy for humans? Does long term consumption of this food additive have negative consequences, even if ingested in sensible amounts (regardless of the sodium intake issue)?Basically, for those out there who don’t eat a lot of fish and would prefer not to eat anything out of the ocean, is this fortified salt as an iodine source safe? Thank you Dr. G. for any science on this.Yes, it is safe. Keep in mind that salt in processed foods is not iodized, however. Anyone whose main source of salt is processed foods may still need a source of iodine.When iodine was first added to salt to help ppl avoid goiters, there was no massive processed food industry. Therefore, adding a little iodized salt to a WFPB diet is not a bad idea.Read labels – most salt containing iodine in the US also contains DEXTROSE.Dextrose is just another name glucose. Your body and your brain run on glucose.Got curious and checked the label. There’s not even a single calorie of glucose in a single 1/4 tsp (1.5g) of salt. There’s more glucose in a placebo sugar pill.BTW If I were ever in a life-threatening accident, I would HOPE I’d be administered dextrose/saline solution to keep my body from going into shock.Oops. Forgot this.That seemingly never ending fascination trying to use a measurement of volume as a measurement of weight not helping the message. Tsp’s is like watching a toddler trying to cram a cube in the round hole, over and over and over again, if a kid keeps doing that after a certain amount of time the parents should start to worry a little bit. If a kid can learn……..The research used weight, the Good Doctor has converted the weight of that component found in a given volume of turmeric so we can measure/visualize the amount. Dr. Greger does a great job of explaining the science to the whole audience.Should be using metric exclusively, my bad.The doctor is an American; in the lab he uses metric, in his kitchen and garage/shop he uses English units. Get over it, were Americans, we don’t use metric exclusively and we don’t drive on the wrong side of the road.No that wasn’t so bad. It’s more so your tendency to be targeting Dr. G’s material for what you think is wrong. I see lots of good stuff!!This is somewhat off topic but when I was in junior high, the late 1960’s, the US was going to switch to metric but it turned out that it was too expensive for the auto industry to retool. Now the auto industry has retooled for some time and the US is still on the English system that even the English don’t use. It is time we americans got out of our comfort zone and made an effort to join the rest of the world. Perhaps NF could display both measurements since they are being internationally read. I notice my measuring cups have both english and metric. When we divide 5/8 by 2/3 doesn’t one convert to decimal to solve the problem?I too was in JH when the switch to metric fizzled. Unless there is profit in switching; it probably won’t happen quickly. Manufacturing and medical have been slowly changing to metric, even packaged foods usually have both systems. The latest cookbooks however are still old school. I only responded to Arjan to defend Dr. Greger’s delivery (not that he needs defending) as I find all his messages well composed and very understandable. I wouldn’t want to add additional work (displaying both measurements) to his plate. Indeed, when I read European articles no one bothers to include measurements other than metric for the American readers.That’s because we don’t want to check the internet or books to get an estimated average density of a substance to help us guesstimate a certain weight of something.We get a scale instead of a spoon and we weigh off 5 grams.Metric is easier and unavoidable because it makes sense, and it only remains an issue if you avoid using it. And it would just be polite to settle for once on a the system 96% of all mankind has already agreed upon, and the system that doesn’t require books full of conversion tables but is as simple as: http://www.geek-jokes.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_detail/public/images-gallery/USvsEU.png?itok=5TOSh7BoNo biggie for a spice when speaking of typical amounts used in cooking here in the U.S.. Do European cooks measure small amounts of dry ingredients in fractions of grams?So how does one know if one is prone to kidney or gall stones? In a normally healthy person is a gel cap filled with turmeric and a bit of black pepper a good thing or a risky thing? I feel like we’re getting mixed messages here.The simplest way to apply this, in my nursing opinion, is to use 1/3 tsp turmeric daily for preventive benefit; but if we have undiagnosed aches and pains, we should partner with our doctor to get evaluated and discuss any nutritional treatments.Let me add the metric conversion: 1 tsp = 0.6 cl; 1/3 tsp. = 0.2 clThank you. Just frustrated with the back and forth.LDGourmet, FYI, I’ve been taking turmeric capsules of approx.1 tablespoon (12 “00” caps) ,with 1 tablespoon capsules of cardamon and 1/2 tablespoon of tellicherry black pepper daily for 4 months. Oh, I forgot, 2 cups of blueberries also. I do this for cancer prevention and muscle and joint flexibility. I drink 60 to 80 oz of water daily, lift weights and run. I feel great at 62. Every – body – is different. This is working well for me so far. I also have several others healthy eating habits. My blood work is excellent. No health issues and my very high risk genetic cancer propensity is being held in check. Best wishes to you.You WILL know when you have one and it isn’t pretty! LOL. I’ve had both, excruciating! I no longer have a gallbladder, and had numerous recurrent bouts of kidney stones before going plant based and dropping 1/2 my body weight about 5 years ago. I hope I don’t jinx myself, but I haven’t had a problem since and eat way more of the supposed “offending” oxalic acid containing plant matter than I ever did before, so feel there is a lot more to the equation than meets the eye. I can’t be very specific or scientific, but I am quite sure it has everything to do with no longer consuming animal products, since other episodes of weight loss were of no help. Sure wish I knew about WFPB ages ago!!!You could also go to PubMed and type in curcumin, or any number of branded preparations, and read the thousands of positive studies. Here is one for Meriva:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21194249Actually plutonium is an artificial element so it is definitely not natural which is probably why it is so incredible toxic.Hi Jane’s Addiction,One study (http://tinyurl.com/o546uzv) from 2008 suggested that because much of the oxalate in cinnamon is not water soluble, it isn’t as available for the body to absorb, and to end up in the urine for excretion (thus affecting risk of kidney stones). In this study, the percent of oxalate that was water soluble in cinnamon was 6% vs. 91% water soluble oxalate in turmeric. The authors concluded that supplemental doses of turmeric, but not cinnamon, could increase the risk of kidney stone formation in susceptible individuals.However, this study sample was very small (11 healthy adults). Further complicating the interpretation of the results is the fact that plants are, well, plants. They are living organisms, and their composition can vary greatly based on soil conditions, pest exposure, heat, light, moisture, fertilizer use, and other differences in growing conditions. So, just because the cinnamon used in this study didn’t contain a lot of water soluble oxalate, that doesn’t guarantee another cinnamon source wouldn’t have higher amounts.In the end, I think it’s wise to be cautious about loading up on cinnamon (beyond the usual culinary amounts), if you have any reason to believe you are at risk of kidney stones – hHave you ever had stones? Has anyone in your family ever had them? Have you ever had blood or urine lab results that suggest this is a problem for you?If you really want to take cinnamon in supplemental amounts, you may want to talk to your doctor or pharmacist about it first. When taken in typical culinary amounts, I don’t believe cinnamon will pose a risk of kidney stones.I do running to keep fit and a couple of years ago I decided to try barefoot style running. I bought the shoes for barefoot style which have no absoprtion because one mainly runs with the front of the foot striking the ground. I found it ok but one day I caused swelling around the achilles tendon running for a bus barefoot style with a small rucksack on my back. I saw my local doctor and he said it was just a little inflamation and no serious injury had been caused. I did however sporadically get pain and swelling around my achilles tendon even after I had stopped running barefoot style. I decided a year ago to start consuming tumeric with my food, about a half teaspoon a day and I did notice after a couple of months this inflamation around the achilles achilles tendon cleared up. I also noticed that I ceased to have occasional pain around the joints that all runners experience after a hard run. I must admit it is difficult to confirm that it was the turmeric but before I started using it after strenuous workout I did feel quite sore but not anymore. I can’t quite get passed the horrible photo. Is that the best you could come up with depicting a pregnant women. ( I do appreciate the information on kidney stones)Ooops!! Good to know this info! I’ve just had a big glass of warm water with a squeezed lemon, tiny bit of Himalayan salt, and a tablespoon of curcumin, with some black pepper, because I was starting to feel fluey, with a sore throat and temperature. In just 30 minutes my symptoms disappeared, and I feel just fine! Amazing! But I guess it’s too much curcumin? Or maybe to have a big dose like this only when you feel something coming is ok?The article just posted (discussed in my post just now) says curcumin actually suppresses the immune response. In the case of a cold, this may be a good thing since the symptoms are largely an OVERREACTION of your immune system, whereas if your immune system is finely tuned you will experience no symptoms even though the charge of the rhinovirus is at full rage.Thanks very much for your response, Daniel! Wow, and all this time I have been thinking that curcumin actually boosts the immune system, as shown in quite a few studies. It is quite confusing to see how some studies say one thing and others say something completely different. Looking all over the internet, I find more sites where they praise the immune system boosting properties of curcumin than the opposite. How can we be sure? It happens with so many things. One example: Dr McDougall says that the potato is a fantastic food, and that we could live on potatoes alone. But Dr Greger says that potatoes are bad for us. I admire and respect both of them. What should I believe?So often, following the culinary practices of our ancestors is shown to be a healthier option. Because of this, I was not surprised to read that use of turmeric in cooking is probably a safer route than taking a curcumin supplement.The abstract of the new article posted on Facebook http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23701561 says, “colorants like curcumin exert significant suppressive effects on the T helper (h)1 immune activation cascade in freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.” Does this mean we should moderate our turmeric intake no matter what, or is this yet another case of the sum of the whole food works better than the sum of its deconstructed parts?I am a healthy, fit (5’6″, 125 pound) 39 year old. After having 2 babies in 2 years, I had severe cholecystits and biliary colic while trying to nurse my newborn. I opted for cholecystectomy because it seemed the only way I could eat enough food to support myself and my baby. That was 7 years ago, and I still have less digestive comfort than I enjoyed prior to the surgery. I also experience intermittent alcohol and fat intolerance (holidays or birthdays may result in severe episodes of vomiting or diarrhea). I eat a plant based diet with ‘meat on the side’ several times per week. I suspect my liver becomes fatigued and am looking for a nutritional support for my liver. Curcumin has been suggested, but I only find evidence of it’s ability to support gall bladder function, which would not apply since I no longer have one. Any suggestions?I suggest looking at Dr. Greger’s videos and resources on liver health. He has suggestions for liver support. The curcumin may have additional benefits. Check with your doctor about using it or adding turmeric to your diet.First, I wish to say thank you Joseph and Dr. Greger for such a wonderful website.Now, as for the Turmeric supplement, I have started taking Turmeric Curcuma 450 mg one or two capsules per day a week ago. The reason I started taking Turmeric is for my osteoarthritis in my finger joints.I have developed number of side effects, just one week after taking it – some are really bad. So I did further research regarding Turmeric supplements. I came across an article called “The dark Side of curcumin”. After reading the article, and the fact that I have developed these side effects, I am not sure if I should continue to stay on this supplement. Here is the link to the article, just in case someone might be interested in reading it – http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/ijc.24967/asset/24967_ftp.pdf?v=1&t=ib9n9l6v&s=2f28030b10740c29731e314cd82821b8470dbfdeRegards, ZoraHi Zora. You are very welcome! I suggest if you started developing side effects to stop taking it. Does the same thing happen with straight turmeric powder? Although osteoarthritis is different from rheumatoid arthritis perhaps some of the same foods or treatments could be applied? Turmeric is not the only spice to help fight inflammation. Check with your doctor about alternative supplements and discuss the side effects from curcumin. Also the link you supplied doesn’t seem to be working for me.Thank you Joseph. I will stop taking the Curcumin capsules for now. I did try Turmeric powder a year ago or so, just once or twice – I just was not fund of this spice. I may try it again. I will keep looking into other kinds of anti-inflammatory remedies. I prefer to keep the pain and inflammation via food and spices if possible, instead of resorting to NSADs. I have removed all nightshades vegetables, all dairy food, wheat and other grains that contain gluten. I don’t eat soy products either. I am curious Joseph, what is your opinion on nightshade vegetables and arthritis? As for the link I provided, you are right, it doesn’t open for me either – not sure why. Sorry about that. But if someone wishes to read the article, one can google “The dark Side of curcumin – Wiley Online Library”. It should appear at the top of the page.Regards, ZoraThanks! I agree that if you can avoid taking NSAIDs (or minimizing) and instead find alternatives, than more power to you! Nightshades only affect so many people, but they can be more problematic for folks with arthritis. You could try introducing them back one at a time. You should know within a few days (at most) if the food is causing pain. I would hate to steer you in the wrong direction so please tread lightly and ask your doctor or a dietitian about an “elimination diet.” You can read the way we conducted the elimination phase of our dietary intervention for people with migraines.

Can I expect a daily pure fruit smoothie, without added juice or sugar, to bring back my gout attacks?No way to predict. We in medicine know little about why gout attacks occur. We do know the higher the level of uric acid in the blood the more likely you are to have an attack. I have had patients with low uric acid levels have attacks and patients with high uric acid levels not have attacks. We have told patients to avoid meats for years but now should be cautious about consuming fructose. Fructose is found in all fruits along with glucose and sucrose( i.e. table sugar which is half fructose and half glucose). I would be cautious when consuming fruits. It is a little complex since some fruits contain more than others and the amount of glucose is a factor in whether the fructose is actually absorbed from the intestine. The best recommendation would be to try and keep the level of consumption consistent and if you get an attack cut back. Good luck.Dr. Forrester: I can’t remember if I’ve mentioned this before or not.

It might be left over from my meat eating days. I read that apple cider vinegar is very good in the sense that it shrinks the stones?Is it true that those who regularly take acid reducing medications for GERD have low B-12 levels due to reduced absorption caused by the medication? If so, how do we increase our B-12 absorption?Vegetables and fruits contain potassium citrate, which is metabolized into bicarbonate in the body, thereby helping to prevent osteoporosis. Moreover, potassium bicarbonate supplements have been shown in numerous studies to prevent and reverse osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. This is well documented. So I don’t understand how bicarbonate, which helps to buffer an acidic diet, could be a risk factor for osteoporosis.I have bad acne, I read that it can help with acne if applied topically.

Maybe in 2015 you can provide some data on best diets for cystic fibrosis. This is a tough go for some, and special diets and nutrient intake seem to be of the utmost concern and need.Then why don’t you do your own study on under-represented populations? As a half American Indian, half Mexican (does that make me 3/4 American Indian?), I can plainly see what the standard American has done to our population. I try my best to stay away from sugar and flour of all colors, not just white. At family gatherings, I bring a big bowl of green beans to share. Maybe it helps a little.“At family gatherings, I bring a big bowl of green beans to share. Maybe it helps a little.” Yes, I believe it does from my own experience bringing plant-based dishes to family gatherings. It’s a great way to encourage people to try foods they don’t normally prepare at home and maybe inspire them to do so. A recent example was an acorn squash recipe I prepared for a family event this fall; it was devoured and received many, “ooh, this is really good”.Smart with the acorn squash! I did that once and was shocked that not one person had had it before!what about if you already have glaucoma? do these foods also help lessen the severity of the condition (assuming you haven’t gone blind yet)?Hanna, check out this video of Dr. Greger’s on “Dietary Treatment of Glaucoma”: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatment-of-glaucoma/For a full list of Dr. Greger videos that touch on glaucoma, click here: http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=glaucomaAnd, incorporating greens into your diet, if you don’t already include them, surely won’t hurt.Is cabbage as healthy as collard greens (collard greens aren’t common here). What about spinach, silverbeet, turnip leaves, radish leaves, beetroot leaves, mustard greens, bok choy leaves, choy sum leavesI did a pubmed search of glaucoma and diet and couldn’t find any information on cabbage and the other foods you mentioned. Given the complexity of the antioxidants in plants I believe eating a variety with a focus on kale and collards… if available would be consistent with the best current science. Good luck.My mother began suffering the effects of glaucoma at 60… my grandmother suffered the same disease. Both were declared “legally blind” in their late 70’s and, of course, I figured it is a genetic thing. Maybe it’s genetic but only to a certain degree, though. Our lineage is Caucasian. Neither my mother nor my grandmother were inclined to eat kale, spinach, or carrots, but I eat really huge servings of all three as a trio cooked gently in water with olive oil at least three times a week, and I make smoothies with kale, carrots, avocado, onion and garlic on days I don’t cook ‘em up. Hopefully, my eyes will remain unaffected by glaucoma (I’m 65+ and regular eye exams show no trace of that disease). Thanks, Doc, for this post… I feel less worried about ocular health, for it appears I’ve been taking care of my eyes with diet for quite a few years.Does anyone know if Tangerines would work the same as oranges? Probably a dumb question, but just wondering…Salud para todossddasdadsa asddsadRe: the paper by Wang et al that suggests calcium/iron supplementation increases risk of glaucoma: This paper’s results are disputed in a Comment to the publication by Shaikh Y, Yu F, Coleman AL at UCLA. Rather than analyzing the data based on participants’ self-reported values, they used the participants’ serum levels of iron and calcium, and their clinically diagnosed glaucoma incidence. They found “no statistically significant associations between self-reported glaucoma and highest quintiles of albumin-corrected serum calcium… or serum iron”. Full text at http://www.iovs.org/content/53/8/4941.longOne implication is that self reported data must be considered carefully, and if possible backed up with measurements (a pattern also seen in many other studies).There are too many contradictions in this article. You say that white women don’t eat collard greens, but black women do. Yet at the beginning of the article you say “Glaucoma is the second leading cause of legal blindness in white women, and the number one cause of blindness in African-American women. Obviously, according to these two statements we can conclude that collard greens haven’t helped the black women very much then.I find your views very ethnocentric, and somewhat racist, and very narrow to only include blacks and whites, hardly representative of the world in which Glaucoma appears throughout. Not all white women come from a British or Irish background. Varieties of collard greens (Brassica Oleracea) trace back to ancient Greeks, as well as the Romans who grew several varieties including a less poignant variety that had larger leaves and stalk, and was mild in flavor. Last I checked neither Greeks nor Romans were black.Collard greens also existed in diets for centuries in Brazil, Portugal, Kashmir Valley, the Congo, Kenya and Tanzania, not all of the African nations, so therefore not all black women would eat them, as you imply in your article.In terms of North America, Brassica Oleracea existed before blacks were brought here against their will. The Native Americans ate wild Brassica Oleracea before blacks arrived. What did happen however, is that blacks from certain African countries, once in the USA, specifically the southern states, shared how they cooked collard greens, which helped make collard greens more popular in the USA.In Canada, and the USA spinach, broccoli, and cabbage have been popular since these countries were founded. All of these are in the same Acephala group as collard greens, and contain the same nutritional values, thus once again calling into question the validity of your article , Once including that fact, we now see how people around the world have been eating greens in the same family possibly since time began, once again leaving us wondering how beneficial they are to preventing Glaucoma.","['African-American', 'antioxidants', 'bananas', 'blindness', 'calcium', 'carrots', 'collard greens', 'cooking methods', 'eye disease', 'eye health', 'fat', 'fruit', 'fruit juice', 'glaucoma', 'greens', 'iron', 'juice', 'kale', 'nuts', 'oils', 'orange juice', 'oranges', 'peaches', 'phytonutrients', 'seeds', 'supplements', 'tahini', 'vegetables', 'vision', ""women's health"", 'zeaxanthin']",-,-,-,-,"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/paleolithic-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/GMO/","http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-breast-cancer-by-any-greens-necessary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatment-of-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-prevention-of-age-related-macular-degeneration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12915499,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8690039,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3448787/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22247455,"

Surely there is a solution to this mess but my doctor is not fluent in the genetic compartment of testing this stuff.Soil-based B12 supplements (‘LifeGive B12 Forte’ is a good brand) and AFA blue-green algae (E3Live.com) would both be extremely beneficial for you. AFA has been scientifically linked to higher B12 levels. You want to avoid all synthetic B12’s and go for the living soil-based B12. B12, after all, is a living soil-based organism that was historically found in soil so we’d get it from foods but modern-day agricultural and environmental pollution has contaminated the soil so bad that B12 in most areas has been killed off.I wonder if these products contain B12 analogues? Blue-green algae is known to contain an analogue version of B12, not real B12. Have you confirmed with company that this is a safe and effective method of B12, in these particular supplements?http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20108213 – “Compared to the control period, in the intervention period participants improved their vitamin B12 status, significantly reducing Hcy blood concentration (p=0.003). In conclusion, the Klamath algae product AFA-B12 appears to be, in a preliminary study, an adequate and reliable source of vitamin B12 in humans”. I believe there is another study somewhere regarding AFA improving B12, but I cannot find it at the moment. RobF, I was under the impression that B12 was a living bacteria (an organism lol), do you have information regarding the true nature of this vitamin?Lots of the B12 in many algae’s is unusable, but a small percentage is in some of them. However, even that small percentage is enough to make a huge impact because there’s so much of it. You also have to make sure you have lots of probiotics in your gut so you can fully absorb and utilize not only B12 but all nutrients.Hi joe, this is Vitamin B12:http://www.chemicalbook.com/CAS/GIF/13408-78-1.gifAs you can see it is a simple chemical compound. It is not a living organism. Bacteria produce many things: sugars, carbon dioxide, hydrogen gas, etc. Vitamin B12 is no more a living thing than any of those compounds. Unfortunately this misinformation is quite common in vegan circles.And even B12 analogues will raise serum B12 levels, only real B12 will lower homecysteine and methylmalonic acid, giving the best indication if the B12 is real or an analogue (like the analogue B12 in blue-green algae).Very informative, and i agree, but B12 is not an organsim, it is the byproduct of bacteria. We (humans in general) contain this bacteria that produces B12, but i believe it is not absorbable because it is towards the end of the colon where we absorb little to none of the actual B12.This blog article is even more distressing when you realize that children are the primary consumers of “chicken nuggets.” This fake food is marketed to children and most parents think that they are feeding their kids a nice protein rich food. When you think about how much fried chicken nuggets and French fries kids eat, it is frightening.fat, blood vessels and nerves, and generous quantities of skin or gut lining and associated supportive tissueBut are they composed of chicken fat, chicken blood vessels and nerves, and chicken skin and gut linings/supportive tissue? If so, then it’s still legally a “chicken” nugget.and there come the nutrician to tell us about the MARVELOUS benefits of fat, nerves etc.Didn’t chicken ad says “proteins blabla”. there is no proteins in fats ;).Horrible. How can they sell this junk to kids? I’ve never eaten a chicken nugget in my life. I can tell just by looking at them, that they are not made of chicken!is ANYTHING we eat really what it claims to be? Maybe a cure for cancer, etc. is right in front of our eyes ?(mouths?)/ esiste QUALCOSA che mangiamo che e’ veramente quello che ci fanno credere? Forse una cura per cancro, ecc. e’ proprio davanti agli occhi? (bocche?)A carott is still a carrot, + acetic acid traces because of the fermentation ongoing since start, + a bit a bacterias from earth that we get rid of by peeling them.There ? a rotting flesh with shit over it because of the processing worth less than carrot :3.“How about eggs, bacon sausage and spam? Thats not got much spam in it”Nuggets are a food-like substance…pretty gross, lol..I am visiting this site first time, this article has nice informative..Usmle TutorA misleading article. The nuggets are indeed chicken, they are just not parts of the chicken that are healthiest (or most appetizing) to eat. No need to skew the information and create the impression that this site is overly biased; I would hope your readers are smart enough to figure out that it is not in their best interest to consume chicken nuggets anyway.","['animal fat', 'chicken', 'children', 'farm animals', 'fast food', 'fat', 'fecal bacteria', 'fecal contamination', 'meat', 'obesity', 'Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine', 'pork', 'poultry', 'processed foods', 'processed meat', 'USDA']",-,-,-,-,"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/paleolithic-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/GMO/","http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-bacteria-survey/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-vs-veggie-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-contamination-of-sushi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/yersinia-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-in-a-burger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-tested-for-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-really-in-hot-dogs-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salmonella-in-chicken-turkey-deadly-but-not-illegal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/autopsy-of-chicken-nuggets/","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24035124,"

Because most of the phosphorus in plant foods is found in the form of phytic acid, which we can’t digest.”So if we can’t digest the phosphorous in plants due to phytic acid, is this same phytic acid blocking our absorption of other minerals, such as magnesium, calcium, zinc, etc.? Do meats and fish have better absorption rates of minerals and vitamins, due to lack of this phytic acid?…. and by meat and fish, I am referring to the ones that are not being altered or injected by industry.Phytic acid has some partial mineral blocking properties, but it is a powerful antioxidant and is linked with better bone health. http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=phytic+acidIf my phosphorous to calcium ratio is 5 to 1 (PH/CA), will this eventually lead to bone loss, and or less calcium being absorbed, since it is competing with phosphorous and if phosphorous is always taken in at greater amounts than the calcium, it seems that that alone would limit even more the amount of calcium being absorbed. For instance, if I ate a meal that contained more calcium than PH, versus a meal that contained the same amount of calcium yet far more PH, would the latter meal actually contribute to less of the calcium being absorbed, due to the ratio? Thanks. This all has me confused, but I think there is something here to clear up as many vegans I’ve spoked with on this are concerned, as they too have far greater amounts of PH coming in on a daily basis than CA, yet they are still getting their 100% CA per day. The nutritionist I spoke with thought that the this 100% does not equate to 100% if your PH intake greatly exceeds this 100%, regardless of if the PH is plant-based or not. Thanks, Toxins.Got to love biochemistry but it is and will always lead to more questions and is in general very confusing when using reductionistic science to “explain” adaptive systems. Toxins points are well taken… as always and I agree. I would add to trust your body to do what it needs to do to maintain equilibrium that your body needs. You body is adept at “pulling” in minerals that it needs. I wouldn’t worry about your ratio and the phytic acid if you are eating a varied whole plant diet. If you start developing symptoms you can visit your health care provider to be checked out. Good luck.Despite scare tactics from paleo blogs, phytic acid is not known to contribute to mineral deficiencies in the context of balanced diets of adequate nutrition. Not only that, but it appears high-phytate diets appear to reduce bone loss over time and decrease the risk of bone fractures:http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-osteoporosis/When it comes to overall vitamin and mineral intake, it also appears that those who refrain from eating meat and fish have fewer deficiencies:http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/If you’re still concerned about mineral absorption, you can improve zinc and iron absorption by 50% by including garlic and/or onions:http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-mineral-absorption-enhancers-found/Regarding your question about this statement: “So why are plant-based diets so effective in treating kidney failure patients? Because most of the phosphorus in plant foods is found in the form of phytic acid, which we can’t digest.”Phytate does not block phosphorus absorption. Phytic acid itself contains 6 phosphorus atoms.Since phytate does not appear to cause mineral deficincies in healthy people consuming an adequate diet, though does appear to have protective effects against cancer, heart disease, and diabetes (see videos linked in Toxins’ comment), it does not seem rational to restrict consumption of phytate-rich foods.I think her big concern was if a higher phosphorous intake percentage-wise than a calcium intake percentage-wise on a day to day basis would prevent proper calcium absorption. The concern sort of makes sense to me. I’ve read that a lopsided ratio of phosphorous to calcium – more phosphorous to calcium – is a big no no long-term – – – – – osteo-issues, etc. You look at all the green-munching creatures out there, and they seem to be eating way more calcium than phosphorous.I get about 5 times the amount of phosphorus than calcium on my vegan diet. Lots of beans and grains seem to load up my phosphorus intake, and I get my calcium primarily from greens but it is difficult to get near as much calcium than phosphorous when the bulk of my intake is grains and beans. Does an un-even phosphorous calcium ratio contribute to bone loss? Calcium being leached out of the bones? Thanks. I see to have lost bone mass since going vegan, and have been suspicious of this phytic acid issue you’ve brought up. My intake of phytic acid is far higher on a vegan diet than it was on a animal products, veggies, fruit diet.What about chicken broth or beef broth sold in cans? Are they okay to use or are they just as bad as chicken and beef? Also, what about fish sauce? Has there been any studies on its health effect?This is one of the reasons why I am replacing soda with fruit juice. I know it’s much more healthy than drinking chemicals and toxins. I’d like to add how harmful processed food is too. I came across with http://bit.ly/1uRdXC3 and thought to myself that I should end all these cravings and make a U-turn to a healthy path.","['aging', 'animal products', 'beef', 'bone fractures', 'bone health', 'bone mineral density', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cardiovascular health', 'chicken', 'Coca Cola', 'cola', 'food additives', 'heart disease', 'heart failure', 'heart health', 'iron', 'junk food', 'kidney disease', 'kidney failure', 'kidney function', 'kidney health', 'lifespan', 'meat', 'mortality', 'osteoporosis', 'phytates', 'plant-based diets', 'pork', 'poultry', 'preservatives', 'soda', 'turkey', 'vegans', 'vegetarians']",-,-,-,-,"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/paleolithic-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/GMO/","http://nutritionfacts.org/video/glycotoxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-kidney-failure-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-coloring-in-fish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-soda-and-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/titanium-dioxide-inflammatory-bowel-disease/","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23719553,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22334826,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21741857,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21978846,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21055967,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15742973,"
